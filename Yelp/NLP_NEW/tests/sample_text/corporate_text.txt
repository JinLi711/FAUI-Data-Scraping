where do i begin? i need 10 stars for this place! i had a not so great experience when i went to this shop but oh boy, did they make up for it or what?! i sent some feedback through their website and the head bageler, jotam torres,  personally took the time to write me back. he wrote: "i'm so sorry to hear that you had a tough experience at my shop. totally unacceptable and i want to make sure that others don't have a similar experience." he then asked me to describe the person so he could personally address the issue right away. he then connected me with his operations director and offer me a gift card. he ended by saying: "if anything happens again that isn't to your liking no matter how small, please reach out to me directly to this email address." this is what i call caring. due to an unfortunate event, i cannot receive the card. upon informing him, he wrote back again! "i'm so sorry for your loss sandra.not to worry, if and when you return it will be waiting for you.thank you again so much for your honesty and your help.jotam"amazing! love you guys!!!4.5 stars. great bagels and cream cheese here. they were temporarily out of my usual bagel of choice (they bake throughout the day, so shortages are resolved quickly), so instead i got a piping hot chocolate chip bagel with honey nut cream cheese. both were delicious, and they give an appropriately generous schmear of cream cheese. my only complaint is that their chai latte, which is tea based (which i prefer!) doesn't taste very much like chai. maybe their blend is off, but the latte tasted like a london fog rather than a proper chai. other than that, though, it was absolutely heavenly for this bagel-lover.if you are staying in lincoln park and you need an amazing but fast breakfast, you better be checking out the bagelers coffeehouse! i came here on saturday morning for a quick bite and was absolutely blown away. i ordered the "the bageler" which was a bacon, egg, and cheese with some fantastic chipotle mayo to go with it. this sandwich was a game changer, hands down the best breakfast sandwich i had in a long time (probably tied for one i had in new orleans). the bacon was soft and crispy at the same time, the egg was tasty, and cheese was cheesy and good, and the bagels used were fantastic as well.this place was fantastic and i would absolutely love to come back on my next trip to chicago. if you are in the area you owe it to yourself to come and give this place a try!ugh love this place! it feels so random on the strip of closed stores and dental/eye businesses. i hope it doesn't lose business once the other stores open.  4 words = bourbon chai tea latte. yup. throw some soy milk in there and i'm done. they have good bagels and toppings, and really kind service! plus, the booths and tables are warm and welcoming.delicious. warm, freshly made bagels and drinks. it was worth the wait in the long line for a cheap breakfast sandwich!these bagels will bring a tear to your eye they are so delicious. went on a saturday and had to go back on sunday for another round. the sea salt bagel and everything bagel with their smoked salmon cream cheese are where it's at. the long line is so worth the wait! can't wait to try more of their amazing menu.i feel like yelp led my astray on the bagelers coffeehouse.  it's a perfectly ok establishment, but this neighborhood has so many more exciting options.  i do not understand the near perfect rating for an average and slightly over-priced meal.i came to bagelers for a breakfast sandwich ($6.19 post tax), which came with egg, bacon, and muenster on an everything bagel.  the everything bagel so too salty, and the seasoning mix was not quite right.  the bagel was not the best either, and it is similar quality to what you would get from a grocery store bakery.  the egg, bacon, and cheese was all ok, but this is about the same quality of a breakfast as you would get from a panera bread.  i had hoped for more from a local establishment.there were lots of people working on the free wifi so it may be more of a place you work and can eat/drink coffee.super cute place! the decor and the atmosphere is so welcoming. mostly full of college students so the wifi is excellent and the outlets are plently. however, the turnover rate is pretry low so if you see a table claim it. they don't have a large area but they do the best with what they got. every table has beautiful local flowers on them. as for the food, wonderful. i got the everything bagel gardener sandwich and i was a huge fan. it was easily in my top 5 of bagels. would definitely come here again, but know the line gets pretty long during rush times and you will have a wait (but oh god it's worth it). also their lattes have the cutest art. 5/5 will be returningthey were open on a sunday when another preferred deli was closed, so i decided to try something new. chicago yelpers lead me astray. it was not worth the 4.5 star rating.the bourbon vanilla chai latte was just plain chai tea with milk! no notes of bourbon or vanilla came through.the pumpkin pie latte was weak and they didn't even mix it properly, as all the seasoning sat on the bottom.the fisherman's sandwich had a generous amount of salmon. the only problem was the everything bagel. where did all the seasoning go? see pic. otherwise, it was an enjoyable sandwich.overall, it satisfied my craving for a lox sandwich, but i would not return.best bagel sandwich in chicago! consistent and friendly staff. would recommend to anyone!! the must try is the  bageler sandwichthese bagels are incredible! there is a printer station as well in case you need to print.mmmm yum. my hangover was craving so substance before my day could begin. i found this place open early on a saturday morning and in my neighborhood and of course top rated reviews. i did not purchase any coffee and was torn between the bageler sandwich or lox sandwich. once i decided on the bageler (eggs cheese bacon chipotle mayo), i was ten torn between bagel (of your choice all made in house) or a croissant! i went with bagels, more filling. i waited quite a while, maybe 15 minutes. i arrived there about 8ish and while sitting waiting then eating the line was almost out the door and i'm sure those people waiting much longer for their orders. it was delicious i would definitely go back! cute spot kind of hidden i rode right past it ok my bike initially.this place as always a go to when we lived in the area.  today we stopped in to get 2 items to go;  a bagel and a bagel sandwich.  the first bagel was with cream cheese.  they didn't even toast/steam the bagel but rather just threw it on a cold bagel.  for the bageler sandwich they didn't toast/steam the bagel either but just threw the fixings on it.  so it was a mix of a room temp bagel with warm toppings.  not sure if they changed their approach on their bagels before serving them but they didn't ask us either if we needed them toasted/steamed before either making the sandwich. disappointed in what used to be a very solid, go-to spot.   as mentioned above these were to-go so we didn't realize it until we opened them when we got in the car.one of my favorite local places for coffee and bagels. very nice staff and great atmosphere to hang with friends or catch up on work. highly recommend the farmer's bagel sandwich.great coffee and bagels. these aren't new york level bagels per se, but they're the closest i've encountered yet in chicago. kettle-boiled, homemade, and served warm, they pair nicely with their homemade spreads. i got iced coffee (just right and the price is right, too) and an everything bagel with chive-garlic spread. yum! nothing here is overpriced, and they have wifi and art for sale on the walls. what a nice spot to hang out, study, or catch up with a friend! i'll be back to try some of their other bagels.this is a super cute little bagel, coffee and tea place! i got the sea salt bagel with garlic and chive cream cheese along with a berry iced tea and it was all really good. they give a generous amount of cream cheese on the bagel as well, no skimping! i went around 4pm and it looks like they also put up a lunch menu too around 11am/noon or so. super quirky and cute here. would highly recommend!while on a walk around the neighborhood on this lovely afternoon, i saw a line out the door for this bagel shop and decided to see what people were waiting for- i'm so glad i did! the shop was small and cozy, 6-7 tables at the most....the sounds and smells greeting me were music to my senses...the art work was interesting to look at, and i didn't mind the wait to place my order or pick it up. there were large samples of chocolate chip bagels and cream cheese to try while waiting-a sweet taste of what was to come.my go-to on the weekend is always smoked salmon and the fisherman was a fantastic sandwich: i chose an everything bagel to accompany the salmon, pickled onions, capers, and tomatoes- crispy, chewy, savory! i couldn't decide between the giardinara or garlic chive cream cheese, so i bought them both :) loved them both :) and saved some for later.i also had the bageler on a jalapeño bagel and it spiced up the fried egg, bacon, muenster cheese, and chipotle mayo perfectly!! it was a true breakfast sandwich (at 12 noon).even though it was kinda warm out, i had a luscious hot chocolate with whole milk and it was frothy, rich, and velvety--fab!the bagelers coffeehouse was an excellent way to start my weekend, and i know what i'll be trying next: the sea-salt bagel with strawberry jam and peanut butter....mmmmmcame on a wednesday morning and was surprised to see a good steady flow of business. these are delicious boiled bagels (nyc style), a variety of different and unique spreads to put on it. we ordered the bageler sandwich on an everything bagel (bacon, egg, and cheese). it was a little thin at first glance, but still really solid and on a great bagel.i woke up really craving a bagel and even though i've lived in lincoln park for a year, i wasn't sure where to go. i found this place and i'm so glad i made the 12 minute walk! i got a salted caramel coffee and an everything bagel with garlic chive cream cheese. it was all amazing. you can definitely tell the cream cheese is homemade. i took it home to eat because i was alone but i can't wait to bring my roommates back to dine in. the place is so cute. i will be back for sure!i accidentally stumbled upon this coffee shop, and i love it!there are so many different bagels and pastries and the coffee selection is up there as well! i cautiously ordered the salted caramel latte and it was amazing! i let my husband try it and he couldn't stop drinking it.cozy little spot, has lots of seating.instagram: @chefnatashaate here on a recent trip to chicago. my boyfriend and i were wandering the streets and stumbled in. we split an everything bageler and it hit the spot! paired with some delicious coffee, it kept  us fueled through a morning walk and trip to the zoo. the atmosphere is cozy and there were nice little flower arrangements on the tables. next time i'm in the area, i will return!would highly recommend! the ambiance was good, cashier was friendly and patient, and the food was delicious. my friends and i all order the fisherman on everything bagels and regular spread. in retrospect, i should have ordered the garlic spread, so i'll have to do that next time. the salmon portion was quite generous and there was a heavenly layer of cream cheese. not too many capers (a plus for me) and the tomatoes didn't make the sandwich feel soggy. the coffees were fine. ordered a salted caramel mocha which was very sweet and a cafe au lait that was fine. seems like a nice place to meet with friends casually or get some light reading done.this was the absolute perfect place to refuel after a tough workout in lincoln park! i'm from new york, so i judge any non-new york bagels pretty hard. i loved the everything bagel and would go everyday if it was closer to my apartment!at least over the weekend, the atmosphere would be great for catching up with a friend, rather than camping out with a laptop for 10 hours.i also have to shout out to the friendly service! even though i was sweaty and basically nonverbal when i ordered, i was treated extremely well for a $6 bill!the bagelers is great! lovely ambiance - lots of seating available - plus friendly service and tasty bagels. they were all out of the bagel i ordered so they gave me a coupon for a free bagel next visit.ordered 5 items on uber eats and only received 2 out of 5. i was very hungry so i wanted the rest of the food instead of the refund. messaged uber eats who said i would receive a response within 24 hours. then i called the restaurant. first of all the guy on the phone didn't even apologize for what happened after i explained the situation to him. then he informed me that i had to contact uber eats directly to resolve the matter, even though it was the restaurant that screwed up. to top it off the guy hung up on me. would not recommend.it's a small cafe covered in art from local artists that is available for purchase. perfect for a quick bite, a relaxing place, or a spot to hang out and have a conversation while sipping on coffee or eating a bagel. absolutely loved their smoked salmon bagel sandwich. they were very generous with the salmon and the sandwich over all was amazing. the vanilla latte was excellent it looked to me like they used actual vanilla which elevated it that much more. i will absolutely be back.in house kettle boiled bagels! need i say more. i got the bagelier and it was perfect. the first bite you could tell the bagels were fresh. i wish i could try every bagel they had and all the in house spreads. maybe next time. if you are close to this location and they are open please stop in great service, great food, and great prices.this place has a great assortment of bagels, sandwiches, and salads. music was great, staff is kind & accommodating, the coffee isn't bad either. plenty of places to work from (small tables) and located on a great street near restaurants, other coffee houses, and a small park. one of my favorite small/quieter cafes to get work done in.the bageler on and everything bagel is amazing. stopped in for lunch, coffee, and a workspace for an afternoon and was not disappointed. reliable wifi, friendly staff, delicious coffee, free water, clean restrooms, gorgeous local art on display and for sale. i will definitely return.was in the area looking for a affordable breakfast place and found this gem of a bagel place. had the bageler (egg, bacon, chipotle mayo, cheese) and it was pretty awesome. 10/10 would visit again.imagine a warm, quaint little cafe space, with the best bagel and drink options your little heart can desire. that's bageler's. i love trying their creative drinks (they have so many - and they are all delicious). my favorite is the apple chaider - half chai and half warm apple cider. yum. they have many cream cheese options and different bagel options as well (highly recommend strawberry cream cheese on any bagel!). the staff is friendly and no matter how crowded it is, they are fairly quick with getting the food/drinks made. it's a smaller place, but can fill up quickly, so bring your laptop and if you're lucky, you can snag a table to get some work done. i love this little laid back neighborhood spot!the east coast elitism in me can't love this place because of their " schmear" options. ready:nutella is not cream cheesepeanut butter is not cream cheese jam is not cream cheesethis seems easy enough, but this place had many "schmear" options, but few cream cheese choices. it isn't worth leaving the house and paying money to have someone give you a scoop of nutella on bread. the bagels themselves were fine; a step above the grocery store's bakery and a step below new york bagel deli. however unless you are after a locally made cup of coffee or one of their bagel sandwiches, i would save your carb lust for real, cream-cheese-filled satisfaction.i'm a royal customer to "the bagelers" satellite kiosk at the jefferson park blue line station since i commute to/from rosemont for work.  i was browsing through deals on groupon and spotted the groupon for the bagelers' main location in lincoln park.  oh man, i love this place!  can i purchase more of those groupons?  i think i know the menu quite well at this point.  here are my recommendations: 1) the bagelers' brew: it's similar to a coffee slushie, and i believe there's a shot of espresso in it.  it's probably one of my favorites at the bagelers and is available limited time only.  2) sesame seed bagel + honey nut spread: i have had a number of bagel/spread combos, but this combination is the most memorable ones for me.  i'm a fan of their honey nut spread.  3) everything bagel + giardiniera spread: it screams "garlicky, garlicky and garlicky!"  make sure order a large iced coffee to wash down that smell in the mouth.  the decors are clean and simple, featuring art pieces for sale.  the dining room is equipped with nice, comfy sofa seating.  it's located in the chic, urban, and walking-friendly lincoln park neighborhood, so there are many trendy restaurants and boutiques to poke around if you've got time.17 jun 2018bageler's coffee housevery nice breakfast/lunch sandwich place. all three of our sandwiches were well balanced. i had a butcher special which was very nice and balanced. my wife had a very buttery almond croissant. my daughter had a bagel with cream cheese and lox (smoked salmon).the only down side was that the ac was broken or not sufficient. they had fans blowing the hot air around (90f plus degrees weekend).i'm kind of shocked by the high reviews and popularity of this place.  we went in at 8:30 on a sunday and it was already filling up.  right away we were bummed to discover they didn't have high chairs, which just seems silly in a family friendly area like this.  we ended up using our own that attaches to the table, but the tables are super flimsy and were afraid our 1 year old was going to tip the darn thing over all meal!all would be forgivable if the bagels were amazing, but they were so chewy and doughy.  barely toasted and just plain gummy.  plus the every seed bagel had about a grand total of 1 of each seed.  very disappointing.  i'm adding one star based soley on the cream cheese, which was actually awesome.  the garlic chive was phenomenal, and my husband really liked the giardiniera one.  but i'm sorry, if the bagels aren't good, i won't be back.stopped by for a quick breakfast before leaving the city. we had the bageler, a plain bagel with cream cheese and an ice coffee. the bageler was wonderful. all the ingredients were cooked just the right amount and the bagel was fresh. i highly recommend the sea salt bagel. it was delicious. the plain bagel with cream cheese was perfect. no need to dress up a well made bagel. they also warmed up the bagel which was a nice touch. the ice coffee was fresh and strong. there was free wifi and light music playing in the background. food came out quickly and many customers stopped in on the go. not frills at this bagel shop, but who needs anything special when the food is great? will be going back next time i'm in chicago.their bagels and service do not disappoint!their sesame seed bagel with giardiniera cream cheese is the bees-knees. you'll thank me later and i will charge you a bagel for the recommendation.their prices are also reasonable. a flavored iced coffee, bagel and cream cheese comes to $5. for chicago, that's great!the place can be a little tough to find and you can easily walk right past it (like i did the first time). just look for the decal on their window and enjoy the deliciousness to come.just got an almond croissant and the pumpkin pie latte. it was missing a bit of nutmeg or something. i'd want to come back to try a bagel sandwichever since moving to chicago, i've been searching for my go-to bagel spot. i think i found it with the bagelers coffeehouse. i love their everything bagel with plain cream cheese, but they also have other cream cheese options. their bagels and cream cheese are made in-house. there is also plenty of seating on weekday mornings.pros: best bagels in chicago. line out the door on sunday proves it. chive onion cream cheese is incredible. croissants are unreal cons: coffee is mehno allergens or ingredients listed so assuming nothing is gf or veganit's a decent bagel and coffee shop, fairly cute with and almost rustic ambiance. being from ny i'm rather picky about my bagel so it's missing some of that ideal almost doughy texture. way better than einstein's or panera's monstrosities though, if i had to guess they probably steam than bake instead of boil than bake. don't drink coffee so i can't comment on that, the latte i got was fairly standard fair though, i think if it was slightly less sweet it would have been phenomenal. their cream cheese is legit tho, would come again. above average as far as chicago is concernedgreat little bagel place tucked away in lincoln park. the bagels are the best around the area for sure. it does get crowded on the weekends so come early!bagelers is one of my favorite places for a good bagel! they have good coffee and good bagels, which is a win in my book. (i'm a big fan of the garlic bagels.) bageler's bagels and coffee are all affordable, and there is a printer available in the cafe. however, beware, they are so popular at certain times of the day there are no seats left, and there is often a decently long line! a hit or miss if you are intending to sit and study. in addition, there is often moderately loud pop music playing in the background, so it may not be the best choice for studying if you don't have headphones or have the ability to tune it out.the one star is for yelp. i went to the location given on the map and it was a different coffeehouse that was closed. yelp said it was open. it was 15 degrees outside so i'm a little frustrated.i got the bageler sandwich and the chai tea latte. while the sandwich was amazing, i was a bit disappointed with the chai tea latte. it tasted a bit watery, but was still okay overall. i would eat here again, although i can't say anything about service or atmosphere as i had it delivered.i'm not sure if i've been to a coffee shop so pleasurable! the staff was super friendly and very genuine. their latte was smooth and tasted like the almond milk was toasted, which was a nice flavor. i had an everything bagel with cream cheese, and it was worth every calorie! the everything bagel had the perfect ratios of seasonings and was soft, chewy, and warm. the cream cheese was super creamy and flavored perfectly--not too cheesy, not too bland. as far as the vibe of the place goes, it has a homey-feel, is relatively quiet (depending on the customers there), and has a wonderful mellow playlist with some older hits playing in the  background. perfect place to study since they have wifi. 10/10 would recommend and will be back!first visit:perfect music at perfect volume, a first so far in chicago. greeted and made welcome, clean tables, two beautiful smiles behind the counter, excellent service, fantastic bagel and toasted properly and just the right amount of topping, and, the bagel was quartered for ease of eating. excellent latte, nice and hot as requested, wonderful flavour. i shall definitely be returning!!thank you ladies!!my new go to bagel shop! my friend and i were looking for a light breakfast to start our day and we were going to go to a popular bagel spot by the red line belmont but decided to try something new and no regrets. i wish i had something this cute in my college days cause this would have been a prime study spot. the bagel choices were really simple, either a lox or a breakfast bagel and then your basic spreads with bagels. the tea selection was impressive. i normally am not a tea person but their tea latte options got me since i was thinking it'd be like a milk tea. got the litchi noir latte! it wasn't exactly like a milk tea but twas good. it came unsweetened so i added 3 packets of sugar on the raw and 5 squirts of simple syrup.. the amount of sugar i need to sweeten my drinks kinda scare me.. but #donowregretlater i guess.friend & i got:bageler on everything bagelbageler on a croissant (though it came out on a sea salt bagel due to misentering from the cashier)passionfruit green tealitchi noir lattewould come back for my bagel needs!great place to do some work and offers anything you would ask of a coffee shop. apparently they serve lunch too though i haven't ventured there.one complaint is that while tasty, our hot drinks were not nearly hot enough. don't know if this can be addressed with technique or appliances.soooo good. i reccomend this place. good begals.holy crap batman! if the bagels don't get you then the house-made spreads certainly will. everything is so good. all the bagels here are absolutely perfect. they are chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. and my favorite spread is the chive. the herbs are so fresh and the garlic is so flavorful.  i love that the menu has just enough options without compromising quality. people are friendly. your order comes out quickly. the coffee is pretty good. but not as good as the bagels. nothing tops the bagels.bagels are great, but the garlic chive cream cheese is out of this world. highly recommend!i absolutely love this coffee shop - probably my favorite in the chicago area. there are a ton of bagel and cream cheese/spread options (my favorite is the poppy seed bagel with the honey nut spread) and it's pretty cheap! i also love the almond milk lattes. the place is small but every time i've gone there isn't a huge crowd, it's a great place to get homework done - love love love!my favorite bagels in chicago! i literally crave the jalapeño cheddar bagels from here on a weekly basis. i can't get them delivered to my house, but they deliver to my work via uber eats and i order in bulk so that i can take them home with me. highly recommend!came here for a lox bagel. bagel was below average. sandwich did not meet my expectations. staff is friendly. 1 star for the pop punk playlist. do not recommend/ will not be back.if you like carbs and coffee, this is the place to be. i got a bageler on an everything bagel and an iced vanilla latte- couldn't have been more delicious. the bagels were fresh and warm and the coffee was much better than other chain coffee spots you can find around the area. this place also had plenty of seating which was a plus! the perfect place to stop by on a weekday morning to plan out the rest of the day in a peacefully quiet and cozy environment.picked up the lox on an everything bagel. amazing bagels. incredible homemade cream cheese. wish they had more bagel sando's but i digress... love it!i absolutely love the bagels and coffee here. their spreads are great and made in house. the bagels are cheap and make for a delicious and quick breakfast. the coffee is sweet but if you like sugary coffee it'll be perfect. their caramel coffee is pretty good. they also have a really cool vibe to the place with large pieces of art on the walls.came in just by chance just walking by. i had a chocolate croissant and a couple of coffees for me and my friend.  didn't try the bagels or sandwiches because we were in a rush, will be back to try soon!i was looking for a place to study and this place was in the area so i went to check it out.. i'm glad i did. a lot of tables and free wifi with a lot of plugs for laptops. a lot of students go there because it's close to depaul. i tried 2 of their bagels and they were delicious. the bageler was really good and i had to try their home made spreads and they didn't disappoint. the bagels were cheap and they were fresh. the coffee was good as well i think they brew either (intellegencia/ bowtruss) coffee. if you are looking for a place to grab a small bite and do some work this is the place to go.the bagel = well made. raspberry iced tea was also tasty.i was shocked they didn't have the basics - no egg salad, no breakfast sausage. limited options - as a former nyer, bagels were well made and came with everything possible on it.rock solid breakfast delivery through ubereats.  driver was quick and courteous and the food was surprisingly fresh.  i was a little worried how a toasted bagel sandwich would hold up but it arrived piping hot and still crispy, not soggy.  iced coffee was delicious (and much needed).  wish this place was closer to my home, i would surely visit the storefront as well.bagels were awesome and price was spot on. will defiantly be going back. lots of selection and variety with all the cream cheeses made in house.coffee. bagels. farmhouse decor. i love it all! i stopped in for a bourbon vanilla chai latte and an everything bagel with smoked salmon cream cheese. absolutely divine! the ladies working were lovely. definitely looking forward to my next visit.nice spot in my neighborhood to chill, drink tea, and do work/study. the sea salt bagel is delicious! they have a really nice variety of teas and coffees as well for a really good price too. they have free wifi and it was not crowded at all.we just went in for a monday morning bagel, our first time here. we bought everything bagels with smoked salmon and garlic chive. the bagels were perfectly sized, not doughy, and perfectly toasted. i liked the garlic chive spread a little bit more, just because it was sooo garlicky and so good! we also bought an almond chocolate croissant, and it was one of the better croissants i've had in the chicago area. two sticks of good quality dark chocolate with delicious almond paste on top. yum! can't wait to go back, and looking at the reviews, it might be better to go on weekdays.i was craving a lox sandwich for brunch and decided to stop by this place because it was close. its a cute establishment with some booths and some tables, but its definitely not a big place. their lox sandwich is listed as "the fisherman" and it is $8.50. i got it on top of a poppyseed bagel. honestly, i wasn't too impressed. instead of fresh onions, they use pickled onions which tasted a little weird with the rest of the meal and the smoked salmon was extremely thick and not too...smoked. i also got a cup of regular black coffee, but ended up throwing the whole thing away because it tasted too burnt? whatever it was, it wasn't good. i think i would stop by again, just because they did offer a very interesting selection of tea lattes and regular bagels, but i probably would avoid getting a regular black coffee and dropping a lot of money on a mediocre lox.i discovered this place in january 2016 and have been here dozens of times since. there are a few drawbacks: seating can be tricky, the music is sometimes a decibel or two too loud, and they were once out of coffee creamer at 10:30 on a sunday morning. but for all of its "faults," i absolutely love the bagelers. i usually come here once or twice during the week - and sometimes on weekends - to work, take in the atmosphere, and get my bagel-sandwich fix (not to mention a large iced coffee).as a work-from-home writer, i enjoy seeking out new coffee shops. but as long as i live in the area, this will be my go-to. if you've never been here, you should change that - and soon.yes, i'm sadly upgrading my review and downgrading the stars.don't get me wrong - the bagels and coffee/espresso drinks are just as good. that is, if you can get them.almost every sunday anywhere from 11 am-12 pm, i call the bagelers to ask if they still have bagels. this sounds like a dumb question, right? it's a bagel shop, of course it will have bagels! wrong. after being fooled too many times and going to the bagelers late morning on a sunday (it's also about 30 minutes from my apartment, so it's a trek) to find out that they don't have bagels, i've learned better. now, i call ahead of time. and to my expectation and dismay, they are out of bagels 95% of the time (or at least the flavors you actually care about. come on, no one wants a plain or a wheat bagel).it's pretty disappointing that a bagel shop is out of bagels before 12 pm, when they are open till 5 pm...and when the issue is happening so regularly (at least 3 sundays in a row at one point), shouldn't you have learned to stock more bagels? although these are great bagels, you'll be lucky if they actually have the one you want stocked.more of a 3.5. i loved the interior of the place and had the feel of what a café should be like. it was the perfect place to do some work or catch up with a friend. i stopped by saturday morning to try their fisherman sammich. they didn't offer onion or garlic bagels, which isn't the biggest deal, as i can settle for almost any bagel. i went with a plain. the bagel itself was pretty good, but not as good as i had hoped. i still would take their bagels over nyc bagel deli's. for the rest of the sammich, it was alright, but not that memorable. i liked that they changed it up with pickled onions but it didn't quite do it for me. their homemade spreads and cream cheeses seemed pretty good. i tried their coffee and this was more so disappointing. it tasted pretty weak and not as robust as i would expect for a café.service was alright. the guy taking my order was friendly and didn't have to wait too long for my order to be ready. overall, it was fine. i would come on in if i was already in the area.for now and probably for a long time, i will still be yearning for a top notch lox & bagel like that from actual ny.i'm shocked that it took 3 months of living one block away to discover this amazing spot. top notch bagels and lox here. since moving from new jersey to chicago i never understood the steamed bagel trend. here bagels are large and crispy. my boyfriend and i both got the fisherman on everything bagels and will be back for more.four-star coffee and food establishment, but i had to dock a star for the smoke that was killing my eyes--not sure if this was a one-time thing or not.i got the bagelers on an everything bagel and it was quite good--i loved the slight hint of spiciness in the chipotle mayo, and i appreciated the fact that they used real eggs in their sandwiches as opposed to bottled. they also use ipsento beans, so the coffee was very good as well. it's a little on the loud side, especially on a weekend, so add on the smoke and it's not very conducive to getting work done. overall, a solid place to grab and go, but i wouldn't plan on staying given the volume of people, noise, and air.great little bagel shop in lincoln park.  bagels & spreads are delicious and reasonably priced.  highly recommend for a quick breakfast.this place has the best bagels! soft and slightly chewy just as a bagel should be. the actual cafe is a great place to study with little booths and plenty of outlets. the staff is also very friendly! the only con is their coffee-not my favorite. overall, a cute little cafe with amazing bagels!my boyfriend and i walked here on a sunday morning. this is his favorite bagel place in chicago so he wanted to take me. he loves bagels and could eat 2 a day....me not so much. not that i don't love them...my jeans just don't seem to enjoy all the lovin. they make their own bagels and cream cheese in house so everything truly tastes different than any other bagel place. i got the everything bagel with garlic and chive cream cheese and my boyfriend got the salted bagel with honey nut cream cheese. if you have important people to talk to you that day, don't get what i got. don't get me wrong, i loved it! but between the bagel and cream cheese, there was a lot of onion and garlic flavor. i would totally go back and get it though. we got 2 coffees too. not sure what coffee they use but it tastes really good. enjoythis place is such a gem, especially if you like relaxing music. from its warm colored pictures to its hidden store front, if you are looking for a place to have a good conversation over  equally good bagels, then look no further. a little vacation from a busy city.the only possible downside is that it's small inside, so you might have trouble getting a table at busy times. otherwise? no complaints.husband and i came this weekend for breakfast- we had the fisherman and whatever the turkey sandwich was... farmer maybe? i got my fisherman on everything bagel and subbed garlic/chive cc for plain. and it was awesome. i love smoked salmon on a bagel and i love that bagelers does pickled onions instead of just straight up sliced raw onion (also capers and tomatoes... yum). husband loved his turkey and he added giardinara cc to his sandwich which he raved about.everyone talks about the coffee- i don't drink coffee so i can't comment (husband said it was strong and tasty) but i was very happy that they have a bunch of teas on the menu, and it's real leaves in a looseleaf bag- not a crappy tiny tea bag. real tea drinkers, rejoice!we also tried the chocolate almond croissant which is big and tasty.all in all- loved it. very friendly staff, great neighborhood joint. i will probably be back next weekend for another fisherman :)love the fabulous quality and affordable prices.  watch out dunkin.vanilla bourbon chai latte -- delicious!  barista told us to continue steeping for 3 mins.  real tea leaves in a pouch.  house made syrup (woo hoo!).wall paintings -- rotational and available for purchase.  support local artist!outlets -- plentiful by the wall, near seats.wifi -- available and a click away.venue -- clean and organized.staff -- hello gents!  friendly, informative and quietly charming. *wink wink*a coffee house that truly cares for your belly.  cellulose-free.  synthetic-free.the bagels are delicious, and they have fun flavors every so often. the iced coffee is great, too. plus they offer almond milk! the only downfall is this place is very pricey for a quick bagel and coffee stop.my first time stopping in and i'm all whattheheckthisissogood.    had the sea salt bagel with garlic chive cream cheese and i'm not kidding when i say that this is the perfect combination. the bagel is slightly crusty on the outside an oh-so-pillowy on the inside. cream cheese straight up amazeballs with awesome little slices of chive all up in there. staff is friendly and professional, with shared seating with strangers for added excitement on your weekend. skip cba and come directly here!update 2 minutes later: this cannot be understated-- i think this is the best bagel i've ever had.good people, good atmosphere & music, good bagels. you can't really find boiled bagels like this in the lp area, they do em right here. love the small feeling, personal touches in decor, and friendly staff.you must give it a try!this place is absolutely amazing! there everything bagels and sea salt bagels are incredible!! the only place i've ever had better was in montreal which is the bagel capital of the world. the coffee at this place is five stars‼definitely worth the trip to lincoln park.despite all the negative hype surrounding bagels.. sometimes you just need to indulge in one.. and bagelers coffeehouse is just the place to do it. their bagels really are fresh as they make their own bagels and spreads which is a huge plus because who wants bagels that are shipped from somewhere else.. frozen, thawed and then sold? the selection of coffees is also ample and everything i tasted was delicious. it is a very homey coffee shop with great customer service. my personal favorite was the poppy seed bagel toasted with garlic chive cream cheese which even my picky 5 yr old devoured. although this place was slightly out of the way for me as i live closer to their satellite location at the jefferson park blue line el, it is definitely worth the trip (and the calories)!every now and then, you find a little place to eat that makes a big impact. the bagelers coffeehouse is that kind of place. when we walked in to join the long line on a saturday morning, my pic said, "this better be good cuz  i don't wait 20 minutes for coffee anywhere".  little did she know what she was about to be exposed to!  the counter staff was friendly and helpful to everyone. smart team behind the counter, too. one person on bagels and cold drinks, one on sammies, another on hot drinks, so serve time is quick. got her a salted caramel latte, me the bourbon vanilla chai, and a bagel. wow!  bagels are excellent...just like those i get in nyc...and better than others i've had in chicago. when she had her first sip of the salted caramel latte, her eyes rolled back in her head and she moaned, "oh my god! this is incredible!"...and it was. the housemade salted caramel syrup is buttery and smooth like they melted down high quality caramels and added angel's breath. lattes are perfectly made and, when ready, announced by the coffee goddess with the beautiful voice. our second trip was just as good so it wasn't a fluke. so if you come here and see a line, just join in. it's worth it!knowledgable staff and great coffee! they make their own syrups! cream cheese for bagels are made in the shop as well. very great atmosphere and great location!came in the pouring rain but it was well worth it!i stumbled upon this small place last week for brunch. upon entering my senses were awakened with the fresh aroma of bagels and brewed coffee. i settled on a bageler sandwich on a raisin cinnamon bagel. holy moly was that the greatest choice ever!i love me some bagelers! yummy bagels & cream cheese. great brekky sandwiches too. if you aren't in the mood for a coffee, try a chai latte or delicious berry lemonade. best bagel place in town.i love the bageler. the sesame bagel with egg, muenster cheese, bacon, and this garlicky chipotle mayo is so damn good! they also have house made jams and cream cheeses. i've been stuck on the bageler sandwich but they have so many other tempting options. the dirty iced chai is my favorite thing on earth right now. they serve counterculture coffee. i love it here, i crave it, i'm totally hanging out here again soon.just got bagels here for the first time. they were excellent!! nice and chewy like a real bagel should be! not dry at all. i was pleasantly surprised by the poppy seed ones as they not only had seeds on the outside but on the inside too!!! yum!! and the salt ones were just salty enough- not burn-your-mouth salty like the traditional places. they were also super nice and even sliced all the bagels for us.what a gem! i tried the sea salt bagel with this giardiniera cream cheese many highlighted, and it was sooo good! i was deciding between the sea salt bagel and poppy seed bagel, but the cashier kindly told me that the sea salt bagel + giardiniera cream cheese is his #1 fave. so i went with it. and i. have no regrets. did i mention you get all this for less than $3?! steal. this is also a great place to study (if the wi-fi is working for you, which for me, it wasn't). their coffee options also look fantastic, so i will definitely be back to try those!their lox bagel was delicious! wonderful way to start my morning. i usually don't like capers, but for some reason the capers they used worked well with the bagel; definitely want to go again.amazing food and coffee!  get the bageler on an everything bagel, you won't regret it.amazing bagels and service! plus the homemade spreads are out of this world. garlic chive is my favorite but i recommend trying them all...on a sea salt bagel of course :) if you're in the lincoln park area this is a must try.oh man! these kettle boiled bagels are insanely wonderful! so fresh and so soft!! the only time i don't toast a bagel is when it is clearly freshly made and at its softest - and i feel like that's always their bagels! granted, i haven't brought home a dozen to see how they fare in days to come, but the fresh ones are great!! i love their garlic chive cream cheese but their giardinara cream cheese is unique (at least i've never seen it anywhere else) and delicious! it's a tad bit salty, but it's giardinara! their handmade croissants are wonderful, too - super soft and flaky! i haven't had the sweeter ones, but the butter croissants are great!!i just recently stumbled into the bagelers and i'm kind of addicted now the salt bagel is amazing with anything you out on it.garlic chive cream cheese its best i've ever had. and the coffee is great too and they don't charge you for a soy topper like the rest of the large chains.i'm sold and a customer for life.burned bagel and the salmon cream cheese looks and tastes like chive/veggie. i expected some salmon in it, thinking i may have even received the wrong order.stopped by before went to lincoln park zoo. got the sesame bagel with garlic and chive spread. it was delicious!! this place definitely meet and exceed my expectation.legit bagels. bagel sandwiches with real eggs are hard to find. coffee is on point as well. a bonus is their homemade croissants. deliciousfrom my very first bite of the bageler on an everything bagel, i was in love. first off, their bagels are fresh. they are full of flavor and soft and just filled my life with happiness! so good! i also got an iced coffee with a shot of salted caramel flavoring. the coffee was different if you are a starbucks lover. i still can't quite decide if i enjoyed it or not. but because the bagel was so delicious i didn't even care about the coffee. i would recommend just skipping the coffee and getting a dozen bagels for yourself. so good!awesome local, family run bagel shop. definitely would recommend for a quick breakfast! pros:- daily fresh made bagels and pastries- house made cream cheeses (garlic and chive is awesome) - house made coffee syrups (salted carmel, also awesome)cons: - small interior with minimal seating- busy! don't get me wrong, i'm excited to see hem have business, but there have been a few saturdays where they are out of bagels by 11:30am!my first trip to the bagelers coffee house will always be known as the day i lost my virginity, to a bagel.i walked into bch and the atmosphere is very relaxed and smooth, a really chill vibe - totally put me in the mood - for coffee and a bagel. being a man of the people, i didn't want to discriminate with my choice of bagel, so i figured the everything bagel would give me just that - a bit of everything. i went with the herb chive cream cheese spread because it's kind of my jam.so anyway, i made my way to a corner booth and awaited my order. amongst the wafting aromas of bread and coffee the barely audible sounds of indie rock tickled my ear; i began to feel an awakening. as i sipped away on my coffee, staring off into space, recollecting better times, i was interrupted by a faint calling of my name in the distance. my bagel was ready.i unwrapped my bagel like a christmas package, gently tearing away at the paper with the care of a grandmother who says she's going to reuse it. and there inside laid my prize. never before had i seen anything so beautiful. the bagel was perfectly toasted, edges just a little black, firm outside, with an inside that was still forgiving.the herb chive cream cheese was delicately lathered between to the two slices of bagel, i wanted to make them spread.after some small talk, it became clear that me and this bagel we're going to be much more than just breakfast counterparts.it's not really my thing to take leftovers home from breakfast, but this hot little bagel was different. i ever so delicately rewrapped her and took her outside with me. she came back to my place and i snuck her into my parents room. i don't know why but i always wanted my first time to be in my parents room.i crawled under my parents blankets and took out the bagel from its wrapper. the bagel and i stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity, my eyes gazing intensely at hers. an unspoken bond, unity developed between me and this incredible bagel. it was then i knew, i was going to **** this bagel. as you might expect, it was logistically difficult, but as they say, "love finds a way." so in short, the bagel was totally destroyed, but totally delicious. i decided to eat her as i knew she would have wanted it that way. again, can't speak highly enough about bch, just be careful you don't fall in love with one of their bagels, like i did.really solid neighborhood spot with fresh bagels and good coffee. i'm a big fan of the breakfast sandwich but hold on the chipotle mayo unless you like a little spice in your morning.this place is awesome! i love their sea salt bagel and garlic chive cream cheese- it's seriously an amazing combination! i've also had the bageler breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. prices are very reasonable and their lattes are delicious. service is speedy and the staff is really friendly. this is me and my coworkers favorite cafe in the area by far!i want to eat their sesame seed bagel with giardiniera cream cheese every day. of. my. life.so good. great, friendly staff. cute atmosphere.my husband and i stopped in before leaving the city today. we got there just after opening, about 8 am on a sunday. i had their sea salt bagel with strawberry jam and my husband got their signature "bageler" bagel sandwich. we were both super pleased! very delicious! parking was easy, the ambiance was casual, relaxing and it was such a cute little shop. we will be back!a heartfelt "hello" from one of the counter help staff, right when we entered the shop. lovely ambience with chill music and local artists' paintings on the wall. now on to the food..."the bageler" was delectable - egg, cheese, bacon, and chipotle mayo. "the fisherman" my gf got was legit as well! pretty good coffee here as well. we will definitely be repeat customers.all around very good. i had the latte and an almond croissant. i was very pleased with both items. the croissant was large, flakey and soft; i would have liked if it had a little more almond filling in it (a personal preference). the latte was also very good. while my experience didn't knock my socks off - i can definitely recommend it and would come again. decor - also good, nice wood tables with booths and chairs, local artist gallery on walls, large storefront windows bring in plenty of light to fill the room.value - i thought it was a fair price for the quality.sunday 8:30am, steady traffic, individuals and families with a stroller, seating available some with outlets, wifi.i agree with other reviews regarding the poor ventilation - it makes it hard to stay for long. this is the primary reason i did not give 5 stars.i found this place through brewpass, i'm glad i did and i plan to come back.picked up everything bagels with lox and the fixins on sunday morning for a stroll around oz park. bagels were yummy, coffee was good. no complaints, would return.hidden gem. this place is awesome. their homemade bagels and spreads are the best i've had. my go-to is the fishermen on sea salt bagel. it domes with lox, capers, cream cheese, onions and tomato. they also have a great selection of coffees to choose from in the morning.i love it here!! to me, this is exactly what a bagel shop/coffee house should feel like. it deserves your business. to start, it is full of cute little surprise details that will make you feel valued: there's always a fresh mini flower arrangement on each table (so fab), reasonable/cheap prices for the delicious food/drinks (so rare), ample lemony fresh self-serve water, calm do-work-without-headphones worthy music, and an adorable one-person booth right by the window with an outlet (but don't sit there because it's mine :-p thanks). also there is an awesome consignment shop right next door...def swing in there on your way out. so why didn't i give 5/5 stars despite obviously loving it here? well, they don't have any gluten free options to eat, their hours aren't completely conducive to my selfish desire to do work there until 7/730pm (they close at 5pm and i've been kicked out), and their one and only "slow flushing" toilet resulted in a really awkward moment for me (um, a plunger had to get involved).despite having to introduce myself to their plunger, the bageler's stole my heart :-)mmm delicious bagels! i love my bagels toasted, on the thinner side, with tasty cream cheese and the bageler definitely delivered! i got an everything bagel with lox cream cheese and i enjoyed every bite. in addition to the bagels, they also had so many fresh espresso beverages to choose from. i opted for just a regular coffee and it was delicious. and to top it all off, the ambiance was cute and cozy. this will definitely be my go-to bagel spot when i'm in the area!on the search for the best bagel in chicago and the bagelers coffeehouse has come close to the title. i ordered the everything bagel with garlic chive cream cheese alongside a hot chocolate. bagel was warm, soft and the cream cheese exploded with taste! hot chocolate was thick, creamy and didn't burn my tongue with the first sip- the perfect temp! the only thing that bothered me was the small selection of bagels they had, judging the fact that they didn't have my beloved asiago. but overall- nyc style, kettle boiled bagels with house made cream-cheese, all within a warm and rustic atmosphere, perfect for the upcoming chilly weather!despite being of jewish and new york descent, i have to admit, i'm not all that into bagels. usually, i don't find them worth it. they're caloric, but then i'm hungry an hour later.let me tell you - bagelers is worth it.my partner-in-food and i split an everything bagel with salmon cream cheese and then i got the pumpkin pie latte and he got a coffee. staff, food, and drink alike are all amazing. the cream cheese was the real star, with chunks of smoked salmon & capers. their pumpkin pie latte blows starbucks out of the water. not syrupy or overly sweet, lots of cinnamon and foam. note: their coffee is *strong*. not my cup of tea - er, coffee - but great for those who love a strong cup of joe. all around an awesome place for a snack or a meal and i can't wait to try more!love this place!!! i've been twice and have gotten the bageler breakfast sandwich on a sea salt bagel. definitely one of the best i've ever had. very good quality for the small price you pay. the only thing is you will smell of breakfast food for hours after you leave.this is by far the best coffee/bagel house out there! i got the bageler bagel and the salted carmel latte. the bagel was absolutely amazing!! the people are extremely friendly and the atmosphere of the store is very cute!!!the bageler breakfast sandwich is really good! so you should get one! though i've stopped ordering beverages here because i've had nothing but disappointment. the lattes are flat, feels like drinking milk with a slight coffee flavor. the iced coffee i got here was probably the worst i've ever had, and i'm a lover of all ranges of iced coffee, from your basic dunkin donuts to your fancier cold brews. it was just really weird and gross tasting. my bf agreed. but again, the breakfast sandwiches are really good. so start your coffee brewing at home then walk over for a sandwich while you wait.best coffee and chai lattes ever and amazing and friendly staff! thanks!! the staff are very friendly and always know what i'm coming in for.i stopped in at this little place on a monday and it was a great treat!the bf had never had a bagel and lox before so of course we turned to yelp to find a place. the bagelers totally hit the spot! we both had the fisherman (him on poppyseed, mine on everything) and it was all i could have dreamed of and more. he loved it too.i love the addition of perfectly pickled red onions and little bursts of salty deliciousness from the capers. all of the stuff in this cute little joint is homemade and it is all amazing.all in for two fisherman and a latte it was about $22. that might seem a bit steep just for some bagel sandwiches, but it is well worth it. they don't skimp on the smoked salmon or the cream cheese here! i also had a delicious latte. we are looking forward to bringing bagel-loving visitors here!the bagels are very good! thank god i don't go to this place every morning for a bagel...otherwise i'll be 300 pounds! they are fresh all the time. i love their everything bagel and this is the only place that offers chive and garlic spread. all places have chive and onion but i had never tasted it with garlic until i visited this charming place. their spreads are house made. everyone is very friendly and attentive.love their bagels so much. so delicious and inexpensive! highly recommend coming in for their bagels and i am giving them 5 stars for that alone. had the lox sandwich last time i was in and it was amazing. their coffee is sadly terrible, don't order it.absolutely love this place. today was my first time going and i am quite sure i have found my new study spot! this cafe offers coffee, tea, sandwiches, breakfast, and so much more! they have booth indoor and outdoor seating. they also have a side of the cafe which used to be a house which they renovated. (so cute). it was cozy, quiet and bright enough. they have both couches and table/chairs as options to sit at! they do offer free wifi. i ordered the chai latte (recommend with coconut milk) and the great gatsby sandwich. both were awesome and i'd easily get those both again. note: the great gatsby full size sandwich was huge. i was only able to finish half. i would recommend sharing or getting a half size. the service was great! i'll definitely be back!i went there today for the first time and ordered the breakfast burrito, and it got served to me with no avocado and no cilantro.  when i went back to the counter to ask about it, the guy that took my order had no idea why it was missing those ingredients.  he asked the woman in the back - whom i could clearly see standing right there - and she didn't even look up from chopping something to say, "we're out."  and that was it.total cost for a coffee and a shitty burrito:  $18no thanks.bourgeois just means too rich for their britches. this place is a very quaint little joint to sit, sip a drink and feel special i guess. i bet hipsters love it.did you know bourgeois really means middle class? not even high class, but middle class materialistic. that's a pretty good description of this place. i feel like my reviews are all about my frugality (read: cheapness) and irritation with over-inflated prices. this review is no different.a breakfast bowl, iced chai latte and a scone cost me $20. *does a flintstones double take* twenty bucks for a la carte breakfast?!the berry scone looked pretty awesome, big and crusty with chunks of fruit...but it was the most bland hunk of flour and water i've had since eating motzo. the iced chai latte was decent but standard. nothing wowed me about it except the $4.50 price tag (and not in the good way)the breakfast bowl was probably the best part but again nothing to write home about. the scrambled eggs were fluffy and the avocado was fresh, but the salsa, sour cream and onion were a bit unnecessary except to inflate the price. it was tasty but nothing i couldn't have made at home much cheaper. on a saturday morning, there was one employee, who took orders and served people individually with absolutely no sense of urgency and zero multitasking skills. there were 5 people in line all standing around wondering if the place was really open.i will not be returning.quality of the pig has decreased. atmosphere remains super cool, although cleanliness is down (bathrooms can be gas-station gross, and the one has had the heat broken for a long time...).drip coffee sometimes seems to have sat for a while, it served less hot, and while it's drinkable, i would no longer consider it comparable to the best coffee shops in the city (la columbe, dark matter, intelligenisa, etc)service is also somehow shruggable. staff aren't frustrating but certainly aren't out of their way helpful. the pig is still one of the coolest spaces in the city, but i can't help think that if it had a bit more of its old inspiration, this place would be packed all the time.so i came to this establishment a lot, like everyday for two years, when i was studying. i wanted to support a local independent shop even if it wasn't great. but what i discovered was..well i honestly don't know where to begin... *they are always out of everything- food items, chai, coffee, baked goods. i've been there three time when they were out of coffee! three times!!*and the coffee they do use is kirkland (costco brand) lol  i not a coffee snob but i don't want to pay $5 for costco coffee*most of their food is microwaved because it is premade- eggs, paninis (which sometimes come out slimy )*the same pan of scones/muffins sit in the glass case thing for serious a week sometimes. the old mumbling baker just brings up a giant batch and they sit there until they are gone. by day 2 they aren't worth paying for. if i ask they have always been honest ("those were baked last monday") so that's good at least. *still very expensive $$$ 15$ for a shitty sandwich that comes with a tiny bag of chips  *plan on waiting 30 mins, over an hour if they are busy due to understaffing and what looks like severe lack of organization/operations. *have to use your email for 3 hour internet access. internet doesn't work at all many times. *the baristas are nice but clueless. they always have to check to see if they have what you order. i'm realizing it's probably not their fault though. *the filthy building (which used to be the selling point, and initially what i thought was cool) is crumbling due to lack of upkeep- thick layer of dirt over everything (the ceiling fans & vents are so disgusting), ceiling in the front room leaks bad for over a year now when it rains or from snow melt (i've seen 5+ buckets to catch watch in the dining room)*i wish i could finish with something good, but after talking about this place i found out that it has a reputation for not paying it's employees. so i asked the two baristas - their reaction said it all - they just looked at each other with wide eyes & acknowledged the problem in a very polite way. more respectful to ownership than i would have been if there was uncertainty in my pay checks. * and end of story, i haven't gone back since. i would recommend anyone and their mother pass on this rotting shit hole in lincoln park. ***please see photos***awful. dusty. panini was distasteful. waste of my hard earned money. mood was morbid. would never recommend this place to anyone unless you are looking for a place to go after a funeral.terrible experience. waited almost an hour for mediocre food. my lunch partners' food took an additional 30 minutes. staff was unhelpful. would not recommend this spot and will not be back.absolute gem of a spot located in lincoln park right by de paul's campus. we searched the area for a good sandwich spot that wasn't too chain-esque and this place caught our eyes instantly. it is a small duplex that, on the left side, has a small food shop that has a diverse array of sandwiches and salads that are great for both meat eaters and vegetarians. on the right side is a small coffee and tea shop that smells of delicious aromas from the fresh brewed drinks. food: my girlfriend is a vegetarian but was in the mood for a sandwich instead of a soup or salad. she created a delicious build-your-own-sandwich with greens and a variety of cheeses on sourdough bread. it came out steaming and gooey while not sloppy; the bread was pressed and crispy on the outside yet softer as it approached the cheesy center. i ordered the great gatsby sandwich which was at the top of the best sellers list and i can completely see why. the sandwich came out piping hot with a mixtures of mouth watering smells ranging from the bite of the swiss to the juiciness of the turkey and bacon. the basil pesto was an incredible touch and the avocado added that california club taste to it. i would highly recommend this sandwich the way it comes as it was absolutely divine.  atmosphere: the restaurant itself was a cool, old school home feel that made the experience that much better. there were students working on papers and research while enjoying the sunshine and coziness of the dining area. while there is not much seating inside, it feels like an escape to a comfortable home that also serves up delicious food. consensus: the mouth-watering sandwiches and plentiful salads and soups makes this place a definite stop every time i'm in lincoln park. the cozy home feeling of the dining area mixed with the great staff adds to the all around wonderful food this place has to offer!cute little cafe. the jamaican coffee was delicious, so was their great gatsby sandwich. the sandwich seemed a little pricey, but the size was decent and it was great. we had an issue where one of the drinks in our order was also ordered by multiple people behind us - and somehow the employee  kept giving my drink to the them even after they gave us our food...? some sort of miscommunication there, but other than that it was a pleasant visit and worth the stop :)love this cute little place, very cozy and relaxing atmosphere, can get a little noisy with all the depaul students eating there.  the food is fresh and the menu is interesting.  perfect place to grab a lunch with a book.service 3, atmosphere 5, so average of 4.love the vibe of the place, came on a rainy sunday afternoon and the cozy environment inside was exactly what we were after. the music playing was nice background music and there was a great eclectic vibe to the cafe.we did make sure to stay in the main room, as while there were more tables in the room next door, it was library level quiet and we were there for catchups so that silence wasn't going to work for us. luckily we could snag one of the few tables in the main room. supposedly there is usually tables upstairs but it wasn't open when we were there.now service could left something to be desired. we all wanted tea, my friend wanted an english breakfast. i couldn't see this option in the shelves of tea so i took my tea up to the counter and asked if they had english breakfast, given that's a pretty typical tea. when i asked the woman said they did, but couldn't find it. so i asked if she could recommend which type from those available  would be closest to english breakfast (there were irish breakfast, scottish breakfast and a couple others). her response was "i'm not a tea person" and couldn't provide any recommendations and her demeanor was just that i was putting her out. i'm not usually one to expect too much knowledge from staff about everything on the menu, but when the sign out front says tea emporium i would assume some tea knowledge from staff. so i just grabbed scottish breakfast and hoped it would be ok for my friend.we then waited and waited for 3 teas to be provided (we also got a cookie and brownie but those were handed over immediately). it was surprising that they were using the espresso machine to heat up the tea hot water one cup at a time instead instead of having a kettle or boiling water tap.when we finally got our teas they were fine (provided in paper cups) and the cookie and brownie were great and we had a nice time catching up without feeling rushed.my first time here today. came here with a friend is a big fan! fell in love with the old world charm. there is a adjoining are for only tea and coffee also. everything is really old wood and bricks with black and white photographs of chicago. i had a east of eden sandwich. it was good but slightly expensive at $14 . will be back next time for coffee.utterly ridiculous.  how can a place that serves lunch close at 12:30 on a friday? coworkers and i ordered lunch. a sizable order and we were informed that our order was cancelled because they "wanted to close early". huh?  sorry, no way. why would we (or you) attempt to try this place when you don't know whether you will get your order or not?find some place else.love the pig for quiet coffee meet up or a quick soup or chili.  it's cozy and the servers look like they would be my friends.  wish they had iced tea though.ever since i've moved to lincoln park this cafe has been amazing,breakfast-yummycoffee-deliciouslunch- great gatsby is amazingthe price relates to the portion. some sandwixhes10$, some 6$, and it is because you get 2 huge sandwiches together such as great gatsby.its so convienient & i love the vibe. its a perfect place.servers are slow, unresponsive, and generally cold and unkind. i live nearby so i want to like it, but every time i'm disappointed.i used to love this place but recently came and the chai latte was so bad. it tasted watery and had no flavor. i asked for another one, assuming a mistake had to have been made (in the past i loved all of the drinks and food here! a friend also took a sip and confirmed something seemed wrong) the second one was also horrible.i ended up leaving early to just get food somewhere else.cute atmosphere, plenty of places to sit, huge selection of tea, and decent sandwiches. there's a big wall with shelves of jars of loose leaf tea. you just grab the jar of what you want and take it to the counter to order it. that was something i didn't quite understand on my first visit.3.5/5 for the coffee - only because i had to wait for my latte since the ordering system apparently  forgot about me (pretty homophobic if you ask me since it was pride month) but 5/5 for the eye candy barista.service -1food -2i was so excited to check out this place. but i was incredibly underwhelmed.  i ordered the breakfast bowl with no meat. received it and the potatoes looked like they were the end of the barrel and had been sitting in the kitchen for an hour.started eating the bowl and realized the best part was missing (avocado). went to tell the bug-eyes staff member what was missing and he says "oh we don't have anymore avocado"you don't think that's something i should know before paying? and i looked at him just like that. and he apologized and said he forgot to mention it and continued buzzing around the restaurant.i'll admit, they looked understaffed. but still, annoyed.  i ate two bites and decided not to make a big deal out of the poor excuse for a breakfast bowl.  i got a to go container and decided i'll take this home, buy avocado and use some of my own fresh potatoes to make this the way it should be.just go to mortar & pestle for sunday breakfast/brunch.overpriced, regular customer service. coffee doesn't taste as good as advertised. won't come back.i can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review.  i was a regular here back in the 2000s when i was a depaul student.  i recently came back to meet a client and it's even cuter than i remember.  staff is friendly, wifi is free and the ambiance both in and outside is just great.  highly recommended.we stopped here because they had juices and smoothies listed on their online menu and i am juicing. however, after a half hour wait at the crowded counter area in the back we were informed that they don't have any smoothies and only commercial juices. so i starved while my wife ordered an east of eden sandwich, which she loved. hence the five star. it's just two old houses that have only been mildly upgraded and turned into cafes with a bunch of wooden antique tables and chairs thrown together in a very bohemian mishmash. it works. everyone is ontop of everyone else but it's an intelligentsia crowd and everyone just pretends like nobody else is there. i'll come back when i'm eating solid food again.i had heard of this place but didn't realize how close it was to my apartment. as a graduate student, i was looking for a nearby place to get some good coffee and spend a few hours studying and the bourgeois pig nailed it! during our time there, we had two lattes, a psl, and a drip coffee. all were very good, but i do wish they had been in actual mugs rather than to-go cups. just a personal preference and perhaps they were too busy to have time to bus and wash dishes. i ordered a breakfast panini and my partner the deluxe waffle. the panini had crazy delicious ham and was very tasty and filling, though i see now i was never offered a tomato as promised and it came with the tiniest side of fruit. my partner was a bit disappointed with the "deluxe"part of her waffle as it was pretty lackluster, but i personally think ordering waffles at a restaurant will never result in satisfaction. i would say stick to the sandwiches here as it seems to be their forte. our food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering it was a busy saturday morning. maybe twenty minutes tops? i also need to mention the baked goods they had to offer looked very good. i plan on trying a scone next visit for sure. while i picked on a few things above, what really gets this place 5 stars is the delicious coffee and the ample space to study in a unique and relaxing environment. don't be fooled by the small space where you order food and drinks. they have an adorable patio, another space next door, and another space upstairs to that. the ambience is great and you can find a bustling spot or a quiet corner with some lovely jazz playing above it all. there is plenty of room and if you order food and head next door, the server will come find you to deliver it. hopefully management will be able to fix what other yelpers have mentioned regarding wait times and also make sure no shortcuts are taken when it comes to their food and coffee. for now, i stick with my 5 stars and will be back to enjoy the cafe again.love the vibe in this place, very hipster-y and quaint. the coffee tastes average is priced basically like any other hipster coffee shop. i'd mostly come back here to relax and lay back. oh yea, and terrible service. took about 20-25 mins just to take an order.i love this place!! the  sandwiches are awesome, the cookies scones and muffins are fresh baked, and i think they have the best coffee in the city. also some of the most reasonable prices in lincoln park!i used to love this place, but it's taken a plunge since two years ago. and just when i thought it couldn't get worse, i went there two days ago. the place is like a post-apocalyptic scene, barely anyone there, and a confused-looking barista behind the counter. i asked for a drop coffee, they said they could make me an americano.  no, i would like a drip. sorry but we're closing soon. it was 5:30 pm on a monday. this is a cafe that usually stays open till 10, even in the summer, but they keep changing and shortening their hours every other week. it's just so sad. the last four times i've been here, the drip has always been cold, the barista confused and forgetful, and the place a mess.i've gotten food for take out here a few times (chicken parm panini, veggie panini, great gatsby) and they were average -- so i have been on the fence for a little while.    today, i went to get a breakfast sandwich. it took 45+ minutes, and it is somehow missing ingredients and cold! i am probably not coming back.i love this place, i come here at least once a week, they've got a great espresso, my favorite thing to get is their jamaican latte, i'm a big fan of the warm allspice flavor. they've got a great location right off the fullerton cta stop, cute and trendy interior, outdoor seating is plentiful and beautiful in the spring and summer. my only qualm is with their pastries, most of them seem like their store bought, but i usually don't get em anyways. their sandwiches, however, are phenomenal, but a bit pricey. if you're a cheapo like me, they've got premade half sandwiches that run a lot cheaper, but are still pretty bomb.i've been here twice before. once approximately two years ago, and other time just this past week.i really enjoy the atmosphere/ambience. the decor reminds me somewhat of 1910s/1920s america, and i think it's a very cute place to study or even have a coffee date. however, the most recent time that i was here, the service was disastrously slow, likely due to a problem with understaffing. one single worker was running the cash register, making the drinks, and bringing the food to the tables. there were about 10-12 people in front of me in line when i arrived, and 15 minutes later, only three of them had been helped. i wouldn't say that i'm an impatient person, but it felt absurd to have to wait that long to put in an order (and with 7 more people to be helped before me, was likely going to take quite a while longer). needless to say, i ended up leaving because it was just too slow.last time i was here, it didn't seem to be this way. i remember the line moving quickly, and getting my coffee without any issue. they really should hire some more people.very cozy. great service.  delicious food. you can't go wrong. i live their coffee, cookies, and sandwiches.they should disclose somewhere that their kitchen opens at 8 am . i arrived around opening time which is 7 am and wasn't able to grab a bite before work. slightly disappointed considering i used my only hour to drive to this place when i could've went elsewhere .visited during a weekend lunch hour. nice outdoor seating and the service is friendly. the food is really good. i noticed a lot of people ordering the iced coffees. i love the atmosphere here. the sandwiches we ordered were hot and fresh and really yummy! they have a lot of cool different flavors.i really tried to like this place. the decor and location are awesome and the theme with sandwiches named after books is cute but i just can't do it. the owner is notorious for treating his employees terribly causing high turnover and it shows in the poor quality of service. the last two times i got dishes with eggs in them, they had a ridiculous amount of shell in them. they charge like 3 or 4 dollars for hot chocolate that is literally just powder mix with hot milk. they are always out of various ingredients and products and the final time i went in there, the bathroom door was broken. i believe in supporting local business, but not when it means workers suffering (and crap service tbh).the pig could be criticized for being small. but it is precisely, in part, because it is small that it is so wonderful.the pig (i don't know if anyone calls it this besides me) is intimate. there is a sign out front with a pig. black iron. there is table seating outside. small. closed in a black iron fence two feet high. the sidewalk is other side of the gate. the street leads down to leaves and beautiful houses. eventually the lake. you can go inside where there will be pastries and it will smell like coffee and you will hear the hiss and pump of the machines. you will see into the back "kitchen" which is...like...a-hallway-of-light and no more there's-the-back-door small--like 10 feet by 6 feet--it's the yellow light that matters. students study here by the window, if one can nab a spot. this place is not corporate. not a chain. it is brown and yellow with small tables and pinks and old wooden stairs and small bannisters and railings. glass jars, chalkboard, low round tables, wood would stop bullets.they serve food next door during the day, same old building/house/structure the "pig," that is to say, the coffee pig, is in.if you are in the area and you are buying coffee somewhere else (including the real bourgeois place up on broadway), i'd say you're making a mistake.not only is this place cozy and quaint and full of charm but it smells great. no big chain feel here. this is an independent coffee shop with an amazing menu and delicious food. i've been coming here for almost 20 years and it always has that special feel. plus quiche!really great ambience here as well as coffee and food options!the space itself is very inviting and makes me want to explore every nook and cranny inside haha. the coffee options are simple and direct with the usual cappuccinos and lattes. the food menu on the other hand is expansive and it took me a bit of time to finally decide whether i wanted a quiche or breakfast bowl. sure, the prices are quite steep, but after one bite of my food and one sip of my coffee, i really can't complain.i ordered the 12oz latte with the spinach quiche. my boyfriend ordered the straight up coffee with a breakfast bowl. the coffees were both flavorful and really hit the spot for the both of us. that afternoon pump was much needed. the food was amazing! the quiche was perfectly seasoned and the crust was flaky and delicious! the breakfast bowl packed so much flavor. we couldn't have asked for a better afternoon pick us up!the food is amazing, the service is slow and spotty. young kids working aren't very professional or warm. that being said if you're just here for the food it's deliciouscatcher in the rye  1/2 sandwich was a smaller whole sandwich on grilled marbled rye.  corned beef was tender and piled with perfect sauerkraut and melted swiss.  tasty pickle wedge on the side.  confused on salade nicoise.  "our version of this french classic, our tuna dill salad surrounded by portions of boiled new potatoes, tomatoes, hardboiled egg, artichoke hearts, cucumbers, red onions, nicoise olives of course and anchovies (optional). served with balsamic vinaigrette."  delicious tuna salad, but no eggs, potatoes, dressing or anchovies although i requested it.  traditional nicoise has solid tuna chunks (good quality canned is acceptable) and green beans.  the small generous olives were pitted and not appropriate.  they need to tweak this recipe to be successful.this place has lost a lot of its charm for me, mostly because of the customer service. i have spent many an afternoon here studying and have usually enjoyed it. the ambience and product tend to be pretty good. i came here recently to meet a friend to study. i ordered an iced tea and was informed (without apology) that they were out. okay, fine...i ordered an iced coffee and a great gatsby sandwich. i am handed my iced coffee and it is white as milk. i am not kidding. the barista hands it to me with a shrug and says "we have a very light brew today." alright...so i took a sip and it tasted like it looked - like watery milk. i asked the barista to dump it out and add more coffee, thinking he just added way too much milk. nope. that, for whatever reason, is how their coffee looked. i opted for a cup of hot coffee instead (without being offered any kind of refund...lame). it was watery, but at least it was the right color. i wasn't about to try to order a fourth drink. the bathrooms were gross and the staff all had an attitude. there are way better coffee shops around (i recommend nextdoor on diversey, although it has a really different vibe).i've been living down the street from this place for 3 years now. adorable outdoor seating but unfortunately the service here has been declining upon each visit. they are out of cold brew within the first hour of opening and the employees are frantic behind the counter. this morning they were bickering and audibly arguing in front of a 10 person line by the register. what a shame, i hope they get it together soon because it's just simply unpleasant.our sandwiches were good-not great, but we ate them. that's where the 1 star came from. the experience got 0 stars. the lady leaning on the counter kind of stared at us so we ordered then took a seat. while seated we were checking out the place and we both lit on the ceiling fan. the dust was so thick it could have made fluffy filling for a decorative pillow. then i used the restroom. besides the visible dirt and dust on every surface, there were clues that the seat hadn't been cleaned recently. visible clues. yuck. won't be back. sorry.this place is too damn delicious for the college student clientele it largely serves. when i was that age, anything other than packaged ramen noodles or day old domino's was a total treat so these blue demon's are completely spoiled by having this amazing cafe so close to their campus. excellent sandwiches and salads of which i've had the great gatsby and the sun also rises. they're there two best sellers and both are pretty easy to see why with loaded meat, melted cheese and toppings. served with a fresh pickle spear on the side it's just perfect for lunch, dinner, or in between studies snack. the atmosphere is incredibly chill and can be perfect either an extended session before finals or a first date with a tinder swipe. pretty much anything in between would work here as well now that i think about it. just be sure to bring your wallet cause it's a little bit more expensive than those packed ramen noodles i referenced before.pretty disappointed with the service and general atmosphere of this cafe. upon walking in, we were not greeted because the staff was on their phones. i wanted a cafe mocha and was told they were out of chocolate, but they could make me a different kind of latte. i asked for a vanilla latte and they said they were out of vanilla. i settled on a hazelnut latte. after ordering, we tried to find a table, but the only empty tables were covered in trash that the workers didn't clear off. the tables were also put so close together that navigating through the place was a nightmare, and the upstairs area (that i saw cute photos of) wasn't open even though it was busy. our sandwiches and drinks were fine, but the rude customer service proved to us that we could definitely find better cafes to spend a day off.i've been here several times in the past and always was satisfied. however, we ordered sandwiches to go tonight and were very disappointed. i ordered the "pilgrims progress" which is supposed to consist of turkey, cheese, avocado, onion and mayo as a pressed panini. when i got home i realized the sandwich had no onion, minimal avocado and turkey. the quality of ingredients are good but there seemed to be lack of quality in the prep. for a $10 sandwich this was disappointing. something is off about this place lately...great sandwich if you're willing to wait 45 minutes. we were one of the only tables in the joint on a sunday and waited 45-60 minutes for two great gatsby's. while the sandwhich was amazing, the wait was lengthy. be prepared for a long wait. very slow service. nice outdoor seating. chip selection is slacking.really good joint. delicious food beautiful atmosphere. came here on a whim with some friends and was throughouly impressedwhen i visited: 5.24.16what i got: 12 oz drip, cafe florio blenddrink review: a darker blend with notes of peach and apricots. served in a plain white, medium, white paper cup, the drink was unassuming. getting into the actual drink it was a very smooth dark roast with only a small aftertaste of bitterness. overall, very drinkable and great for settling in and either getting down to work or fully relaxing on a lazy afternoon. cafe review: 'cafe' is a bit of an understatement here. the bourgeois pig boasts a large location off lincoln and fullerton, with ample seating outside in their front courtyard and additional seating upstairs beyond the initial cafe. note, there is a restaurant in the building but in a separate room/space adjacent so since you can't seamlessly walk through it to the cafe i'll be omitting it from this review. the overall aesthetic is antique, old wood and old world style. this is the kind of spot you'd expect out of a hemingway novel, with swing music playing like in a portillo's. the cafe walls are a combination of old exposed brick and an interesting textured siding i am not familiar with. the whole building isn't just for show either; the whole thing is "old chicago" down to the foundation (built in 1893) as evidenced by its sneaky supply cellar adjacent to the rather old bathroom set up. (be aware: the entrance does require numerous stone steps, so beware if stairs don't bode well for you). i for one definitely recommend the second floor of the cafe for those looking for a quieter nook to read, work, or have a more intimate, quiet conversation. overall, the coffee is solid but not the main focus as the atmosphere of the spot is really the key attraction. think of a university reading room meets a swing era coffee/sandwich spot. overall visit rating: 8/10this place was so cool. it's set in an old house, so you can go to different rooms and go upstairs for unique decor and seating. also a nice patio space. good sandwiches and coffee.great little cafe! i got the spinach quiche and that hit the spot! my fiancé got the great gatsby sandwich and it was just perfect! there's seating outside but watch out for the bees! overall, i would go there again when in the area. gives a little hint of italy to its decor!incredible place!!! so beautiful and cozy inside; so beautiful and calm outside. inside is dark and interesting. outside is just like a cafe in europe! summer days outside are the best!! :))) great for going with a friend or two ; nice place to catch up and have a fun mealthe first time i was here, i thought this one door was the entrance, so i'm like pushing on it and trying to open it, then realized that it was a this-door-doesn't-open kind of thing. it turns out that there were 2 girls sitting there. and i was trying to open the door on the one girl!!! sooo embarrassing. they looked at me like i was crazy. tip: use the door further in if you don't want weird looks thrown your waythis is a cute and unique coffee spot in lp! i haven't not yet ordered food here,  but i have had decent lattes here. their patio seating is great! they have lots of tables out in front and you can usually get a table in the shade. i went today and sat on the top floor, which i didn't realize was a huge seating area! there are tables, booths, and couches. the things that aren't great about this place is that you order on one side and then pick up your drink on another side. however the full drink menu is on the walls in the pick up area. so when i ordered my drink from a paper menu on one side, i wasn't aware of more than half of the drinks because the paper menu had a limited selection. i would have ordered differently had i known of my other options. also, there was so little ice in my iced latte that before i got half way through my drink it was lukewarm.i just leaving after waiting over 30 minutes for 1 breakfast burrito to go!! i spent $15 on a coffee and burrito my whole coffee was gone as i'm standing there waiting she brings its out on a plate, do you think i'm just standing here for the fun of it. i have never been so irritated thought i could just walk in and get something quick to eat. i will never be back.i would have probably given them a higher review a year or two ago, but i feel like they've gone downhill lately.  i'll start with the pros:very cute place. it's in an adorable house and it's honestly quite nice to sit in there and eat and drink coffee. nobody bothers you if you just want to sit and read or chat with friends.their selection is food and drinks is pretty vast.cons:the service is what's gone really downhill. the time before last that i went, it was fairly busy and i ordered a sandwich and drink. i waited for a good 20 minutes, and went back up to the front to ask about it. i guess they forgot about putting the order in so they started on it as soon as i reminded them. okay, i understand, they were busy, it happens.the last time i went there i was with my fiance and we ordered some sandwiches. the guy at the front was literally trying to get something out of his nose while we were talking to him. my fiance asked for no avocado on the sandwich and they said it wasn't possible. i thought the reason why they take a good 10 or 15 minutes to make the sandwich was because they were making it fresh? why can't they just not add an ingredient? i also asked for a iced chai tea, he said they were out. i said "cool, can you make me some iced tea? doesn't matter what kind." he wasn't sure.  so i asked about the loose leaf tea, could he just make loose leaf chai (bc they had loose leaf chai) and then add ice? i brought over the tea to him and explained. he gave me water with ice in it with the tea bag so i ended up drinking iced water with a chai flavor to it. the sandwiches again took about 10 to 15 minutes to make and were alright but nothing to write home about. even my fiance who normally loves it there agreed with me that this place has fallen off the cliff. i hope they get better one day, but i understand once you have a nice cushy status in lincoln park, you're made. but i doubt i'll go back unless i hear they've gone back to their better days.my review is only for the food...so far. bourgeois was an option for fooda at my work today and their veggie panini was amazing. warm bread, gooey cheese, and a tasty combo of veggies with a pesto spread. a welcome break from the pizza and mexican food that usually show up for fooda. thank you bourgeois. i hope enough people discovered your goodness hidden down in the basement popup. i'll be trekking over to the cafe next!the atmosphere is great here. it's an old house converted to a cafe. food is decent, not outstanding - but it's a coffee shop/cafe, so you can only expect so much. the main issue is that this place is absolutely packed all the time and is a bit of a college student hangout (often for hours at a time), and there's a good chance you might not find a place to sit. service is usually good, but can be rough when there's a line (there's usually one person working).so i'm sitting in this nice, cozy coffee shop, sipping some yummy coffee and just relaxing.  sounds great, right?  it was.  except i had to listen to a couple of 20-ish philosophy majors who thought they were way smarter than they actually were, throwing around all the big words and classic names they heard in class that day.  talk about ruining my lovely coffee sips.okay, besides that unfortunate incident, bourgeois pig is a really awesome coffee shop.  i haven't eaten here yet, but their coffee is super tasty, insanely hot and comes out quick.  and if you want more than a standard latte or espresso, they have some seriously awesome coffee drink specials as well.  i did have one screwed up order, but it got fixed fairly quickly when i asked.  but the service is...okay.the space is great.  lots of workers and studiers, but if you want to just hang and talk, this is a good place.  my only issue is the cost.  this may be a $ place technically, but for 2 large americano's, you're gonna pay like $10.  no, that's not insane, and by no means the costliest coffee in the city.  but, hey, i'm new here, and still getting used to the asinine prices here.i love the food and coffee here but the service is extremely slow. they are way understaffed and need changes to keep people coming.i showed up before 10am on a sunday, and there was only 1 employee working who barely spoke to customers. his coworker eventually returned from cvs, utterly dismayed by the long line of customers. then she made two hot lattes that should've been iced. then she told me they were completely out of decaf and straws, and there were no slips with the wi-fi password left at the counter. then they stopped accepting any card payments. my friend ordered a vegetarian breakfast bowl and was given a ham sandwich. the location itself is nice, but the employees were both surly and had no remorse about their poor service.used to be really great. now they routinely leave out ingredients and charge the same high prices. really disappointed. especially not recommended for delivery.the atmosphere here is definitely one of a kind. everything seems literature themed which appeals to my nerdy side. now i've only had the drinks but they've been pretty good every time. if i was closer to this place i definitely go there for coffee or anywhere else. i'm sure it would be busy when schools in session but i went in the summer at night so it was pretty empty.this café is really cute and the atmosphere is so nice! that said the coffee is *ok* but nothing special, honestly a little smoky and not as hot as i'd like it to be, and their pastries are not bad but again nothing special. but!!! the atmosphere is really great and the outside sitting area is sooooo cute, the indoor area is really warm and cozy, the kind of place i could (and do) sit for hours with a book or a study date!i stopped in for breakfast at 9 am a couple weeks ago only to be told the chef was running late so the kitchen wouldn't be open until after 10. so i went elsewhere. i popped in just now for a quick double espresso. after waiting in a 4 person line for 10 minutes with nobody taking any orders, i asked the barista if anyone. was along orders. he said it was. just him but he was making chai for another order. i didn't have another 20 minutes so i left. 0 for 2 on service.it's cute, sure, but is it worth waiting 30 minutes for a turkey sandwich? i can assure you it's not. this wasn't a special order. one turkey sandwich. thirty minutes. if you have a lot of time to waste, maybe the ambience can make up for this place's complete inability to be both a sandwich and coffee shop.wonderful little jewel in chicago burbs.   the music and decor takes u back to the roaring 20s or 30s.  food fresh & delicious.  we split one of the iconic sandwiches all named after great works of fiction. we enjoyed the great gatsby.  loved iti came here on a crowded sunday afternoon with 6+ people and used my indie coffee passport for a free coffee.  they marked my passport with a pig-shaped stamp.  their windowpane had lettering that read: "antiquarian cafe."  this place is nothing short of adorable.  the bourgeois pig cafe is a beloved lincoln park favorite.  plus the name is so fun to say.there are two parts to the establishment. when you walk up the stairs, sandwiches on the left, coffee/drinks on the right.  but if you order food and decide to sit upstairs on the right-side, the servers will happily bring your sandwich to you (as i observed).  sweet.i was very tempted to give this place three stars because really, the space does not accommodate large groups.  they do have a "designated" section for group meetings and a sign that tells you to limit your meeting to 60 minutes.  but my goodness, the room is the size of a small pantry.however, i appreciated the uniqueness of bourgeois pig and didn't want its lack of space to impact the 4-star rating.  the truth is, if i were to ever come either alone, with 2-3 others max and/or attend depaul in another lifetime, i would be in love with this place.  if i were a college student i think i would spend an unhealthy amount of time here nestled on a claw-footed chair.the interior is so fun and it feels like a vintage shop just happened to turn itself into a cafe.  if you've ever been to the new elephant resale shop of chicago, just south of depaul's campus on 1145 webster, you might know what i mean.  they have vintage coke signs in french tacked onto their doorways, an extensive selection of teas in a floor-to-ceiling wooden cabinet and just a whirlwind of things to look at and admire (or question).... like in a thrift shop.this cafe has been the one with the most "character" so far on the indie coffee passport but then again i still have a lot more cafes to explore in the city.  happy caffeination! you will enjoy your experience here, just avoid coming in large groups. (unless you can snag the upper room with two claw-footed sofas and sit four facing four with your cups placed on a studded chest doubling as a table).i have given this place about five chances now and been disappointed every time.  you'll notice you can order delivery or pickup here on yelp.  cool, right? not once you realize upon showing up for your order that the people at the cafe have no idea you even placed an order you were charged for.  apparently they do not deliver but have not disabled this on their yelp page for months.  and yes, they will give you attitude like it's your fault.the only reason i continued to eat here is because of the great gatsby - it's delicious.....if you actually receive one.  today i called and ordered ahead a great gatsby, caesar salad and i had a cookie.  the great gatsby was missing mayo, bacon, turkey and avocado.  it did have pesto, artichoke on half of it and random olive slices.  definitely not the taste i had been craving and expected when i got home and bit into the sandwich.  i called the restaurant and was told the new guy made a mistake and gave me a veggie panini?  um....not sure how that happened.  i realize mistakes happen but it was a ton of bread with some random olive slices and a few pieces of artichoke heart on the other half?  i would have asked for my money back even if i had ordered that sandwich because there was barely any product between the bread.  i also waited longer once i arrived to pick up than quoted on the phone so i'm not sure what took so long.  anyway, i was grateful to get a refund for the sandwich.  boy do i wish i had dug into the sopping wet salad which was now inedible and crumbly cookie before i hung up the phone.i have never been treated to such a comedy of errors. stopped in for a latte. manager interrupts my order, which is a huge pet peeve. lady, don't talk over me like i am not here. latte machine broken. there are tables shoved together in a pile like maybe they aren't open. but they are serving people. so i ask for a san pellegrino lemonata . the guy charges me $3.88 and then asks where the lemonade is. there is no lemonade. the guy tries to refund my money. the guy can't figure out the machine.can you hang awhile? he asks.i can. i wait for 10 minutes. finally i approach the manager. i explain the situation. "that costs more than a lemonade so you're fine"i say "lemonade coats $3.88. this costs $1.65. how is this more?"she directs me back to the first guy who now has a huge line.i tell her i've already been waiting 10 minutes.she starts to exasperatingly pull bills from her pocket but they are all too big.she walks off. she finally comes back with 3 dollars.what gets me is her disdain, like i wrecked her day by being a customer.if you are going to run a coffee shop, run a freaking coffee shop.i used to love this place so much. i think it needs a deep cleaning and overhaul of the staff. i paid nearly $20 for a chai latte and a veggie sandwich. the sandwich took *20* minutes to make while i stood there and waited. i asked about it twice. the bread was stale when i got it. (no pun.) upon another visit i paid 8.75 for a cookie and an iced chai. yikes! get it together, bp! keep the small business alive like you mean it!live review: we've been waiting here for over 35 minutes for two sandwiches... that is all. two basic sandwiches. this is not somewhere to come for a quick bite. do not bring your kids. do not come here on a time crunch. do not come here and expect a deli.two stars because it would be a cute spot if i had two hours to eat lunch.very disappointed in my first and what will be my only experience at this disastrous place. after waiting 5 minutes in line (there were 2 people in front of me), the guy at the register proceeds to walk away as i step up to the counter. doesn't say "i'll be with you in a few minutes" or even acknowledge i'm there. the 3 workers i saw there all seemed to work slowly and without urgency. 3 people behind me left because they couldn't wait that long, and i should've followed their lead. after standing there like i was invisible for 5 more minutes, he doesn't even apologize or say "thanks for waiting" before asking what i want. i knew it was a red flag there, but i was hungry so i still ordered food for my sister and myself. we proceed to sit outside, waiting at least 40 minutes for our food!!  after someone who sat down after us got a sandwich, i feared they had forgotten about our food. i walked up to the counter and asked if our food was coming and said that we had been waiting 40 min. the man asked for my name and said they were really behind. he checked with the cook in the back and said it'd be another 3 minutes. we ended up waiting another 7+ minutes before our food finally came. the man apologized, saying they didn't expect the rush from the marathon, yet he said it as an excuse and without asking if we had everything we needed. dude, there was not that many people there, plus they would've known about the marathon and could've prepared for any extra influx. suffice to say, the meal was not worth a 50 minute wait. my breakfast bowl and my sister's veggie panini were mediocre. could've made it better and cheaper ourselves. i asked for no sour cream on mine, which they remembered, but then they forgot to put the avocado on! so, an hour after arriving at this place, i get an incorrect, lackluster meal. my sister and i were not impressed. poor customer service and quality. i'm warning you guys, it's not worth it.hmm... where do i start? 1. overpriced -- paid $37.49 for 2 "1/2" sandwiches (garden party & sun also rises), the nicoise salad, and the fruit and yogurt bowl with plain yogurt--sooo not worth it! prepacked, overpriced, and not fresh. go to panes bread cafe or cafecito in downtown (2 locations) instead, people! the portions, prices, and quality are equal to what you pay, and better than bp--by faaarrr. 2. meager sandwich fillings and salad -- the sar was mainly bread, with 2 skimpy pieces of turkey, mostly bread, and the gp had no hummus whatsoever! the salad, described as: "our version of this french classic, our tuna dill salad surrounded by portions of boiled new potatoes, tomatoes, hard boiled egg, artichoke hearts, cucumbers, red onions, nicoise olives of course and anchovies (optional). served with balsamic vinaigrette" had no potatoes, hardly any onions, 4 pieces of cucumber, and olives that were 90% pit. 3. got my order wrong -- i clearly stated i wanted no cheese on both sandwiches --what did i get on them? cheese! i said i wanted anchovies in the salad, but on the side. what did i get? no anchovies whatsoever! ever since i discovered ap restaurants, i've used it quite frequently, and i can say this has been the worst experience i've had, where not one, but 3/4 items i ordered were wrong. i wanted to try this place bc of the reviews, but i'll never be ordering from here again. they're a place that seems to rest on their laurels, and think it's ok to serve pre-packaged sandwiches, or not pay attention when getting an order. well, oink you, b. pig!i'm not even going to taste my food to write this review. nearly an hour to wait for a sandwich and salad on a not very busy tuesday. cashier is really nice but they have one cook. skip it. oh, and cash only since square was down. awards are years ago.update: wife's salad was wrong. my sandwich was ok, but certainly not for the price.overall: an interesting and fun cafe in the heart of fullerton. great food and atmosphere, just a little too high priced. still great!the good: a ton of sandwiches, all great tasting. great salads as well. haven't had the soups/breakfast yet. the 'treats' are also great tasting, and they have great coffee! cool atmosphere and outside seating too.the bad: not much, just that it's a little overpriced for what you get. the sandwich i had was great, but it was small for $9. if i hadn't gotten a full salad as well, i would've left hungry. $20 for both...atmosphere: 9/10service: 9/10food: 8/10this place is as amazing as everyone says! be prepared to wait in a line, but you won't be disappointed! very quaint decor ....bourgeois pig is a pretty decent cafe to plop down at for a coffee or grab lunch. i like the old house vibe of the inside, which seems very conducive to studying alone or with a group. indoor seating can be kinda limited, though, which is a downside. the outside accommodations are good, if it's a sunny day in lincoln park.on our first visit, my boyfriend got the baked omelette of the day, and it was pretty disappointing. portion size was small for the price, and the staff forgot his toast. when the toast came, it was dry and didn't come with any butter or jam. i, however, got the great gatsby panini and fell in love. homemade foccacia with pesto sauce, bacon, turkey, avocado, cheese, greens, pressed on the grill?! um yum. it was so good, i didn't even feel guilty about not sharing more than a bite.i played it safe and got the same thing the second time i went (so did my boyfriend), but it took forever to get the sandwiches on a seemingly not too busy afternoon. the gatsby was still delicious, but i was also ravenous after running the chicago marathon.i'll be back for the gatsby, but that's it!i found this cafe on yelp so i figure i'd give it a try since i was going to lincoln park anyway. i was only a tiny bit disappointed. the decor and atmosphere was exactly what i love. it was a nice change from all the fancy, over crowded and over priced places i've been going to lately.i ordered an apple cider and the sun will rise sandwich. something along those lines. one of the staff members recommended those two sandwiches to us, so we just followed through. my friend ordered the gatsby. we went upstairs to sit and it made me love it even more. so cozy!! actually, i didn't really like my sandwich. it wasn't terrible, but i just thought the gatsby tasted significantly better. the apple cider was pretty good too. i really wish that there was a cafe with this kind of style in california. wishful thinkings. but i had to subtract a star because i ended up taking a few bites of my sandwich and my friend just ripped hers apart (literally) and took bites here and there.i love this place and have been going here regularly for a bit over a year. super chill atmosphere - great for reading, writing, emails, etc. the food is delish and the patio is super nice. 4 stars because i'm never sure when they'll close. i always thought it was 9, but sometimes they'll start closing at like 6? kind of a bummer. don't get the tea in the cast iron pots because they just make the tea taste like iron.i've become so frustrated with this place. i want to come back but every time i do i wonder what i was thinking. my fiance and i came in to order a couple sandwiches to go. it took over 35 minutes for our sandwiches to be ready. i can go to a sit down restaurant and have a hot meal in front of me in less time. over time the sandwiches have gotten worse. the staff always seems to be flustered and not know what is going on. it's become a big disappointment for me.this is my mother's favorite coffee place on the planet. the building has a magic historical vibe to it. perfect place to hang out. the coffee is good, but there aren't a crazy amount of options. this is the place to go when you want to read a good book, journal, or do some work. to hang out. i would you come specifically for the food or the coffe, i love it here for the building and atmosphere itself!the service here is so bad. they are so slow and so rude. the treat all of their customers like idiots. not sure how they still get business.pretty disappointed with my last visit.  second time coming and i just don't see how i will ever go back in a city where there is an endless assortment of food options.  it seems like this place has become complacent.  i'm aware they have been around since 1993, but that does not give you the right to be meh and charge lincoln park prices and just keep on keepin on.i ordered the half sandwhich/half salad and was charged $14.75(ish).  it seemed high, so i asked the cashier as i paid.. i thought this was $11.75? to no fault of his own, he pointed me to the chalkboard where the updated price was listed. apparently, the owner hasn't updated the menus.  really lp cafe owner, i think you can afford to laminate 15 sheets of new menus.-next, my sandwhich came out on very dried out bread and the salad edges were browned.  very disappointing at any price.i am not one to send back food unless it is truly not edible, so i ate it, but not with much enjoyment and definitely without desire to ever come back.snap out of it bourgeois pig cafe owner!  clean your darn bathroom, put some ice in the water pitchers, sell your day old bread as is, and sell your full price paying customers fresh bread, staff the coffee side adequately, and don't hand out menus with outdated prices.  if you do these things, maybe i will come back one day.this is probably one of the most unique coffee shops you will ever visit. what looks like an old, victorian-era chicago home is now a place to get gourmet sandwiches. baked goods, and coffee/tea.the coffee is good, normally they have bow truss served i have yet to try the tea.the food is yummy. their cold sandwiches are made from scratch and use high quality meat. i personally like "the merchant of venice" which is commonly known as an italian elsewhere. i'm not that great at describing the interior but it's spacious, vintage style and a cozy place to do homework.i would rate this place 5 starts but my only concern is that it is a bit pricey as far as some of their products.i love sandwiches.. simple but filled with amazingness! the layering is an art. this place did me justice. great gatsby is a favorite and clearly a winner. it tasted delicious and it was perfectly pressed. paired with a pickle and a bag a chips. as it should be. the atmosphere is really nice. super chill, came here after a day at the zoo. will be back :)i had been wandering back to my hostel sometime last january, and was desperately in need of a warm something to bring the feeling back to my face. enter the quaint and inviting bourgeois pig cafe. the barista saw that i was having trouble deciding what i wanted so he clued me in to the bacon-flavored syrup they had just gotten, and we came up with a chocolate-bacon-latte. (and yes, it was every bit as divine as it sounds!)it was too cold to sit outside, but they have two floors and the upstairs had been arranged to feel like your living room or a library. the only way to describe their decor is that it has character, from the rich colors, mahogany wood furniture to exposed brick walls and literature-themed menu. perfect for lunch with friends, or just to spend an afternoon in with a large mug of coffee and something to read!nice and cozy place with excellent coffee ( i had the white cafe mocha). panini portions are huge and yum! will visit again to explore more.a cute little cafe near fullerton train stop. the whole cafe is situated in an older wooden house. a great place to slow down your day, enjoy a cup of coffee/tea, read a book or catch up with a friend. also a good date spot. they have seats outside and two entrances as i understood, one of them has cakes (choose that one, haha) but both offer beverages. coffee is good, chocolate cake too, they offer sandwich and small snacks as well.my husband really thought i'd love the place.  he's been here years ago and he loved it.  its a cute and cozy place.  and i loved how the sandwiches have literature inspiried names.  i really wanted to love the place but sadly, the whole experience fell flat. first they were out of soup.  it's unseasonably cold in chicago and you are out of soup.  and when asked if they were cooking any more up in their kitchen, the counter girl said yes, but it would be "hours" before it would be ready.  so we perused the rest of the menu--they have it up on a chalkboard in such an inconvenient area--to read the whole menu you have to walk the length of the room so you might have to walk in front of people already in line--made for a very confusing parlor game.   they do have paper menus at the register--easier to read and you're not getting in anyone's way. the sandwiches.  my husband and i shared the son also rises (on the menu it's touted as being on 2007 best dish list  from chicago magazine)  i wish i had that 2007 sandwich because it was not worth the hype they rave about.  the sandwich was missing the alfalfa sprouts and the bread was not the sun dried tomato bread it is listed as having.  so we missed that whole concept.  the other sandwich we shared was the italian panini which is basically an italian sub but on panini bread and toasted.  i don't know what they did, but one piece of bread was a total soggy mushy mess.  maybe it was a blessing as it was one less carb i ingested?  i dunno but it was real disappointment. and remember that soup that wouldn't be available "for hours"?  well, when our server brought out our sandwiches, another server brought out a huge bowl of steaming soup to another customer.  what the hell.i have yet to try out the food, but coffee and ambiance at bourgeois pig cafe is great!  the main seating area is a little cramped, but they utilize the space well: two rooms on the main floor, upstairs and a patio.  i'm disappointed when lattes taste more like milk than coffee, and that's definitely not the case here - drinks are excellent.it the best sandwich place ever! 20 years ago i used take my son here. loved it then and now ! just ate a terrific sandwich just as good as i remember! good job mason!  open another one in houston, please !coffee = good 4/5 (simple cold brew)food = meh 3/5 (breakfast bowl, tasty but a little overcooked)service = poor 1/5 (bad attitude + 25 min wait for food)stopped in on monday morning for a bite, coffee, and some computer work. sat at the nice patio out front with fresh air and shade. ordered a cold brew and the guy working at the front reacted as if i asked him to wash my feet when i asked for milk that was not out already, then had to check on the status of my food after 20 minutes though there were maybe 3-4 others in the whole place. i get that it's monday, but man what a mood killer.would swing through again, just recommend the staff acts a little less like they hate the existence of humanity."love the pig!! best authentic coffee shop in chicago."  for those sick of the corporate "skcubrats"; it's so great to know chicago still has these spots to call home.if i could give negative stars i would. this place has garbage service and is completely understaffed especially considering the busy neighborhood it is situated. we waited in line for 20 minutes because we were on our way to the lincoln park zoo and had heard this place was just great. after finally ordering, we waited another 15 minutes while the barista made drinks for other people. he had evidently forgotten about us and despite looking and seeing us waiting during that time didn't bother to check in. after confronting the barista to ask either for the drink or for our money back, he rolled his eyes said "yeah i'll make it", gave my boyfriend the wrong drink, and didn't say anything else. by this point we'd wasted an hour of time, $6.00 for a subpar drink, and lost much of our originally planned afternoon. will not return, and you should not waste your time on this atrocity of a coffee shop.so i wouldn't have known this place existed until my friend told me about it. i'm all for cafes and this place was the most adorable and cozy little cafe i've ever been to. rustic decor with a calm and comfy ambiance. their cafe and food area are separated due the original architecture of the building but ask the staff and they will help you to the right place. my friends and i met up here for a quick get together. we got our drinks that were all under $5 btw and went to the upstairs seating area. it was super quite but it was the perfect place to sit and chat. i felt really at home here and i might just make this place my new spot for getting work done. the cafe is tucked away in a little corner on fullerton, so you gotta keep your eyes peeled for it. my dirty chai was delish and my friend gulped down her hot chocolate in minutes. they have food too though, i can't be the one to comment on that. i'll try it next time for sure! other than that, people who enjoy working in cafes should definitely check this place out :)adjectives: cozy, your college kind of coffee shop, spaciousdish: drip coffee and a maple bacon sconebougeois pig usually is busy with nearby depaul students, so the place is usually bustling with philosophical conversation and study groups. a classic coffee shop- mismatched wood furniture, a quality (not froofy) coffee menu, and good music. their music choices are great for conversation, but usually too loud and jazzy for me to settle in with a book. lots of windows and seating, so on early weekend mornings when it is still quiet, amazing place to sit and relax in the sunlight.bourgeois pig participates in chicago coffee passport and offers a medium latte (i added syrup for no extra charge), medium drip coffee, medium tea, or medium chai.free wifi with good signal, but 2 hour time limit.i don't understand where their awards are coming from. a sandwich and a coffee was 13 bucks. the sandwich was mediocre at best. i had the sun rises or something along those lines. the worker there was very curt and unreceptive. i asked for a recommendation as i've never been here and it was like i asked her to do some jumping jacks. 2 stars for the old school layout. other than that i wouldn't bother. go get some awesome coffee and donuts elsewhere. there are plenty of choices around here for that!unpretentious and intimate-sized, this cafe is great spot to catch a bite over some light work/reading material. it gets a bit loud, so i couldn't imagine getting any arduous work done. sandwiches:the beggar's opera w/ a bag of doritos: 4the old man and the sea w/ a bag of potato chips: 4.5herbal blend chilled tea: 4bow truss coffee: 4fun cafe near the fullerton l stop. located in what looks like an old house, the bourgeois pig consists of a sandwich/salad restaurant and a next door cafe. i came with a friend and tried the gazpacho, which was fresh and flavorful. my friend got a great gatsby, which i tried a few bites of--super delicious and large portions! i also tried a chai tea, which was great and foamy as well. we sat outside in their porch/outdoor seating area and read for a few hours in the late afternoon--a perfect summer day spot!this is a nice little coffee shop with good coffee and great ambiance. however, the staff was very rude, especially a college aged girl taking orders. nevertheless it has a nice outdoor seating area in spring time.so, i haven't made a yelp review in a long time but unfortunately i have to share this experience because it was without exaggeration, dreadful. i visited on a sunday night, and it was fairly busy, which is a good sign. i was meeting a friend so i went up to the counter to order before finding a table to wait. i ordered a hummus plate and a dirty chai with almond milk and then they told me there was a 20 minute wait for espresso. no matter how busy it is, a 20 minute wait for coffee is unbelievable. so i went to sit down. 20 minutes pass  by and i get my hummus plate delivered to me. then my friend meets me and goes up to order. she comes back and tells me that my chai with a shot of espresso had been made, and that she saw it sitting there on the counter getting cold (they have always delivered coffee to where the customer is sitting-- the way my hummus plate was delivered) and she heard the manager walk up to it, ask how long it had been there and then throw it out. then the girl at the counter told my friend they were out of chai so she came back to me and told me i had to order something different after i had already paid. so we went back up to the counter, and my friend asked to clarify that they don't have any chai left, and the manager then said that they did! the girl at the counter just says, "oh i thought we were out". so my friend orders the same thing i did (a dirty chai with almond milk-- which almond milk, by the way, costs extra) and then the manager makes mine with almond milk and hers with regular milk! at that point we were so tired of coming up and getting confused that we just sat down, drank our tea, and left. i don't know if this was a rare occurrence but it was absolutely ridiculous. i will not be returning.lovely atmosphere. quiet nooks with plenty of workspaces. interesting layout architecturally, a house turned cafe. pleasant staff and tasty beverages. additionally, their bakery treats are freshly made throughout the day and make the whole place smell delicious. 10/10love this place for veggie sandwiches. i tend to get the secret garden with a jamaican latte (honey & cinnamon). the literary theme is so cute and definitely puts me in the mood to read!! would recommend for sure.they have such a nice space to work with here but the business itself is a train wreck.  there are multiple places to hang out (outside, upstairs, two separate rooms on the main level) if you're looking to go somewhere to get some work done or just have some privacy without feeling like they want you out of there.  they have a room in the back upstairs that you could probably die in and not be found for weeks.having said that, the staff and execution of the business are terrible.  ordering food is always an ordeal because they don't seem to be set up to handle food service properly.  it's not uncommon to hear the employees complaining to regulars about how bad the ownership is; which, after going there a few times i pretty much agree with. in general this place has decent coffee and if you're looking for a shoulder to cry on you can always commiserate with the staff as they're more than willing to share the harrowing injustices faced by millennials on a daily basis.the bourgeouis pig cafe is admittedly around the corner from my office... and let's say i went there about 5 years and waited a ridiculously long amount of time for a basic sandwich - so i've shy'd away from re-visiting until last week.... i'm happy i gave them another shot!i had a 730 am meeting, with a workout before - so therefore had worked up an appetite for something healthy, close and tasty.  my colleague decided to check out the bourgeois - and were pleasantly surprised.  the latte i had was crafted perfectly - and the breakfast bowl's that we both had were spot on (the toast they served with it was amazing).local. tasty & fresh.  check it out if you're in the hood!i ordered a large drip coffee and a scone. the cashier asked me if i wanted light or dark roast. i asked her what the difference was, what kind of dark roast beans.  she just said "i don't know".   trying to help her out i asked "is it like french roast"?  she said "yeah, i don't know...it's intelligentsia" i have drank intelligentsia for years, so i was like, ok whatever.  the cost was about $7 which probably sounds  a bit steep for a drip coffee and a scone, but that was not the biggest problem. the cashier handed me a pile of singles as change, and did not count them.  it just didn't seem right, so i hastily gathered my stuff and found a seat and counted the bills, which were $5 short.  so i got back in line and told her i was shorted.  she said "well, you walked away, what can i do?"  i guess the burden of proof was on me and the moment was over i have to give her that, i should have been quicker, what can i say.  i went back to my seat and was sitting there trying to work, fuming about my damn $5, when i got the idea to ask her, when her shift was done, if she was over $5, could i come get it.  she said she'd count her drawer for me in a little bit.  after about 20 minutes she comes up to me and says that she was "only over $1.37".  trying to even give her the benefit of the doubt, i asked if she perhaps dropped a $5 under the counter?  she was like "no i only had singles, i gave you all singles".  look reader, i know you don't know me from adam but i only walked into that place with 2 20s and i had a 20 and 8 singles when all was said and done.  the employee is poorly trained: everyone knows you count the change back to the customer, and she was clearly never taught this. and my situation is why you always count back change to the customer.  the berry scone was fresh and fluffy with lots of berries.  the  coffee was bad, gritty consistency, with a burnt flavor. i think it was just burnt. i really don't think it was intelligentsia, i have drank it for over 20 years, unless it's just that i never drank it burnt   it was just weird. anyhow, the menu is formidable, vast. there are a lot of cheesecakes to choose from also. the small sitting area is dark and jam-packed with heavy duty vintage tables and chairs.  the place needs a good dusting, maybe redecorating.  in summary i overpaid for burnt coffee and was shorted $5.  i was so upset that i told myself to wait a few days before posting just to stay objective.  there are a few starbucks nearby; i recommend using those. i will never set foot in that place again. i you have to eat here, get tea, not coffee and pay with plastic.we came by bourgeois pig for a quick coffee break during a leisurely day driving around chicago. my husband and i came from out of town, so we had little to no context for this shop, but apparently it's a salient place? our friend and guide told us it was a popular spot in lincoln park.we stayed just long enough to drink some coffee and use the bathroom and sit for fifteen minutes enjoying a spot of nice weather. both the little cafe and the outdoor patio were cute and pleasant. no problems with service. there were people on the patio, but no one in line when we ordered.i had a tasty iced coffee and had a good time relaxing outside. there was some kind of student at a nearby table with a laptop and a copy of infinite jest laid out in front of him. i'm guessing he was settled in pretty good. our stay was short and sweet. i'd recommend bourgeois pig for a caffeine interlude if you're milling around lincoln park.waited about 35 mins for two sandwiches that when i ordered them was told i couldn't modify bc they are premade. so not sure why premade sandwiches take that long when it wasn't busy at all. also there is a fine line between rustic and dirty. this place was seriously grimy. 23$ for two sandwiches that were partly cold is a bit ridiculous.there aren't a whole lot of oldschool coffee shops in chicago, so it's nice to see one that's so well-executed on the atmosphere front. cozy's the word i'm looking for.  what's keeping me from giving it more stars is the food. i haven't actually had any, mind. in fact, that's my complaint. such a sprawling menu, and yet no vegan options. sure, i could ask them to deliberately take half the flavor out of one of their lacto-ovo sandwiches by removing the mayo and cheese, but i'm way too old and jaded for that kind of nonsense.i've been to this cafe a number of times for decent coffee.  today i turned up mid-morning and the place was busy but by no means full.  i went to the counter to order my take away coffee, and was the only one in the queue. five minutes later, staff having wandered around, eyeballed me and decided that they were too busy to ask if i wanted anything i left. i wont be going back, and by the looks of other recent reviews the hip but self important staff at this joint are running it into the ground. shame.i wanted to like it here but won't be back- i spent $11.50 on a sandwich with no sides, which seems overpriced for the neighborhood, but the real issue is the service. after waiting 30 min for my sandwich, i went in to check on it. the woman working the counter didn't apologize but just said it typically takes 30 min. she went back to the kitchen where i could see a row of sandwiches waiting and explained that they are too busy to bring the sandwiches out to people. my sandwich was soggy and lukewarm since it had probably been sitting for several minutes.too expensive and too many options in lincoln park to wait 30 minutes for an expensive sandwich and bad service.well...i don't know. i want to love this place, but on subsequent visits, i've noticed that the food and service aren't that great. i get it that this is a popular spot and that it gets very crowded at times. but it takes a long time to get your order, and the food just isn't as tasty as it could be. soups are incredibly salty but don't have a full bodied flavor that soups should have (maybe they cover that by adding a lot of salt). sandwich bread is sort of dry, and the sandwich fillings are sort of skimpy. i imagine they have to cut back somewhere to turn a profit, especially if there are hordes of people taking up table space all day to surf the internet and drink one lowly cup of coffee. in addition to that, there's never any water, napkins, or silverware to be found. this could be a better run establishment with better quality food and service. but i guess they don't have to be since there's always a crowd. oh well.waited 35 minutes to find out that the staff never sent the order back to the kitchen. offered us a free cookie. we asked for our money back and left. felt like they were "sorry not sorry."best paninis/sandwiches in lincoln park. we love the gatsby the most! the molasses cookies are phenomenal too.been here both to study, and also to eat, and depending on your goal i think you'll have very different perspectives of bourgeois pig. it is first and foremost a café, with the food being secondary. the facility itself is essentially an old house converted into a café on the first floor, with space to study outside on the patio, and upstairs. it is actually a great set-up insofar as its abundant table space, natural lighting, and lack of crowdedness(generally). for food, i've tried both the beggar's opera sandwich(one of their self-reported best-sellers), along the julius caesar salad. homemade basil pesto, grilled chicken breast, swiss cheese, avocado, and spinach on a sandwich? sign me up. when i got it though the chicken was pretty dry, and there didn't seem to be enough basil pesto compared to the rest of the ingredients to really salvage that. all in all, it wasn't a sandwich that really came together for me. salad was actually pretty good, though a normal caesar salad with chicken breast shouldn't be too much to ask for from most any café. 8/10 for the atmosphere and study space. 6/10 for the sandwiches.they may rave about the food and coffee but they have a long way to go in terms of basic customer service, which is equally as important. sorry bourgeois pig, but if you're going to hire a kid who works at a snails pace everything just goes downhill from there.great food, cool people, and veggie friendly, but had to wait 15 minutes for a drip coffee to gostopping in for the first time in years and trying to catch all of the local places i was too young to appreciate back in college. this was an amazing find, decently priced and a wonderful environment for folks who have some time to kill and want to take in some great breakfast food/coffee!the coffee shop is situated on the right side of a old house. i was a little confused about the layout, but the food-centered staff was on the left and the cafe was through another door on the outside. the staff was very friendly, and the place gives off a very casual, cozy (a little messy) quality to the environment. the music was a little loud for my taste though.i ordered the jamaican latte, and my girlfriend ordered the usual latte. i was tempted to go a little bold because this was unique to this cafe, but i didn't quite enjoy the taste. it tasted nice from the honey, but then it was a little spicy and the bottom half of the drink wasn't as refreshing as i would have hoped. i won't be ordering this again, but it was nice to try! the latte was great though. nice to stop by if you're in the area once in a while!the atmosphere here is so unique. it's like grabbing coffee in a house full of tables to sit and enjoy foamy, rich coffee. i got a bianca (white mocha) and it was a rich treat. while the place is a well attended locale by coffee drinkers and laptop studying junkies... the cashier was super helpful at finding a table for my partner and me. she went out of her way to make us welcome and made sure we had a place to sit. i can't wait to come back and visit this quiet, yet lively coffee mansion. parking was simple on fullerton ave. the cookies are nice and soft. the food is also great, fresh sandwiches and great bread.i came here with a friend because the cafe just looked so cute lol. the cafe is split into two - food on the left, drinks on the right. i ordered the iced thai coffee, my friend got the chai tea latte, and we both split the breakfast bowl. food was good and drinks were delicious. the only problem was, the drinks left both me and my friend in the bathroom. i don't know what was in it, but our stomachs were not feeling it lol. other than that, the whole cafe is just cozy and lovely!this is probably my favorite coffee and eatery place in streeterville. you can grab a scrumptious bite, eat a delicious meal or hangout here with friends. you could also just chill or work with your laptop or ipad here as well as they provide free wifi and plenty of electrical sockets.i had breakfast here this past week. i really enjoy the design, the customer service and the food was tasty. i especially enjoyed the hash browns and yummy ketchup. i had a nutella latte with coconut milk that was delicious as well. i like how they have sparkling water available on tap too! i only have one suggestion for the management - do you think you could provide recycling in your restaurant? i asked for my food "to go" but then i ended up having a few extra minutes to eat there, but when i tried to recycle my plastic container there was only a garbage can :( i took it with me to recycle at home, but would really appreciate if you guys could offer this at your restaurant! i will totally update my review to 5 stars if you do this! thanks.this cafe is very cute and crowded. it's super packed with people and laptops on the weekends so it makes it difficult to find a table. there's even a sign on the bathroom door designating people to leave room for diners but of course not everyone follows that. the main menus is just filled with drinks. you'll have to find the food menus either online or on paper pamphlets by the cashier. once you order, the cashier asks if you are dining in or to-go. but dining in wise, they'll ask you where you're sitting. didn't know i was supposed to pick a seat before ordering and considering the laptop crowd, this creates a slight challenge. on to the food -very good! i had the tuna sandwich and they put the tomato, lettuce, and pickles on the side. my friend had the butternut squash, and roast beef. both pretty decent portions and she enjoyed both. the food came out fairly quickly and they cleaned the tables off quickly too. i wish the water cups were larger. found myself having to get up multiple times to fill up an 5oz water glass.i came in for breakfast with my friends on a sunday at noon (about 7 of us). it is community seating, so tables are on a first come first serve seat yourself basis. given that, it's still nicer than a panera to have a sit down meal with friends. we were able to find a high top table for 8 without a problem. they have plenty of seating options for various group sizes. they also have a nice area for people visiting on their own working on their laptops. you place your order at the counter. the menu has a nice variety of options. my friend and i split two sandwiches, the avocado egg wrap and the bacon, egg and cheese croissant plus an order of hash browns. everything was delicious!! i liked the avocado egg wrap for a half a sandwich but i'd be bored with the flavor after that, i feel it needs just a touch more flavor to it or a light spice/seasoning. the hash browns were cooked perfectly and were the perfect portion size. the croissant sandwich was very flavorful and you can tell everything was freshly made. they did have some issues serving our party of 7 at the same time even though we ordered right after one another. they apologized and made up for it which i appreciated so i hope they continue to work on faster delivery of food so tables can eat at the same time. the manager/owner was visible and asking people about their experience and the staff was very friendly. i'd definitely come back!i came in around 8am on a saturday to work. i'd never been before to "dine in", so i was excited to see why so many of my friends love coming here to get stuff done. this place got busy fast! by 9am on a rainy saturday morning it was packed. the concept of an "all day lounge" is great, and as a non-coffee drinker i always feel obligated to get a coffee when i'm using a coffee shop for their space. i don't feel that way here because there are so many options here from food to drinks (including alcohol and pastries). my only gripe is food takes forever to come out. unless i order a coffee or a pastry from the counter by the register, i can expect to wait for my order. i waited once for a bagel to go and it took them 10 minutes to hand me my bagel and individual packet of philadelphia cream cheese on a weekday morning when the place was pretty empty...didn't really put me off, but heads up - on weekends you can only sit in the back at a few reserved tables if you'll be working on your laptop. so no window seats if that's what you wanted!short and sweet review. came here on saturday evening for coffee while waiting on some friends. excellent service, excellent prices (especially for the area), and a fun spot to have a cup of coffee or tea.this review is after a single visit on a saturday that had a temperature high of 96 degrees and the city was hosting lollapalooza, so it might not have been the best time for them to provide their best service. i was there with a group that included 4 adults and 3 kids. we were given the high table at the entrance with no back- bar chairs which really wasn't the best chairs for the kids to sit properly. i'm not sure if they have high chairs for children as none were provided. they have a very simple, easy to follow menu (with calories listed as well). we went ahead and ordered upfront, and once the food was ready, they dropped them off at the table. food was average at best. i got their country benedict which wasn't presented as i'm used to at other places. the poached eggs on buttermilk biscuits were placed in a bowl of pork sausage gravy. i'm used to having a crispy base for my poached eggs, but such was not the case here. it was very hard to separate the taste as everything was mixed together in a bowl or gravy. my wife ordered the midwestern omelette that was made with ham, bacon, wisconsin sharp cheddar, and a side of hash browns. i tried her omelette which was alright, but her hash browns were bland and void of any seasoning. the wait for own food wasn't long at all, but the quality was underwhelming from my end. i can see this place having an eclectic charm, but it just did not fit my needs.great place to atmosphere is absolutely amazing you sit down in a beautiful place enjoy your delicious drink very very very nice and clean environment the staff is what makes this place so wonderful you're so welcome hank very professional they simply do what you want quick and nice with no hassle the food is really delicious they don't have great variety but whatever they have they do it well and it takes very good you should try the orange juice the mocha dice coffee as for the desert the absolutely best thing they have is the chocolate mousse i think it's what it's called easily it's on the top shelf of the food of the best pastriesand precious items the shrooms on bluetooth is the best also been told from my family that the excellence is really goodi love cupitol drinks, but their pastries are really not worth your dime. their brunch items are pretty okay but compared to some of the brunch places around it, this one is just okay. my favorite drink on their menu is the mint white hot chocolate. the place is cozy, with some high communal tables, regular tables, couches, and booths. it reads more coffee shop than restaurant to me at least. beware coffee lovers - on the weekends, they limit the number of tables that people can work at so that the brunchers can find seating. either come early or come on a weekday.my review is based on horrible service not the actual food/coffee...sadly!i have never been to a place where the staff is shoo-ing you out because they are closing in 30 mins.saying something like "please note we are closing in 30 minutes but we hope you enjoy your coffee" would be appreciated but instead we gotwaving arms in the air pointing to the door telling us to get out.rude!i came here on a weekend to study with a friend, but the vibe can be kinda weird at first. i arrived at around noon and it seemed more like a cafe with a ton of people actually eating lunch than a coffee shop for studying. but after a couple hours, all the lunch people left and the rest of the people there were just studying. it was kind of hard to get near an outlet and half the seats are really uncomfortable to sit in (think hard wood chairs). overall, not the best coffee shop to study at but also not a bad coffee shop to study at. my latte was really good and the food that people ordered looked and smelled really delicious! will definitely be back even if i'm not studying there.such a soothing environment and very spacious! ordered the nutella latte and mocha latte but unfortunately, we were not indicated which latte was which and when a taste test was done, it could not be indicated as to which latte was which. it really wasn't that big of a deal so we continued to drink our coffee, enjoying the weather of chicago and playing tic-tac-toe. also ordered some sort of strawberry cake and it was quite tasty.good place to eat, not great but good. the water glasses are like shot glasses so you have to keep running up to get water. i wouldn't tip as there is no wait staff. they give you a good amount of food for the price and it is prepared somewhat well. i got the ham and it was very dry. i would come againi was in town to go to a blackhawks game and visit friends.... they wanted to go to a "coffee place" for breakfast.... why? i thought to my self. i actually want food for breakfast... well to make a long story short. bang! we arrived and got our food. the food was awesome!!! i can honestly say, i have never had as good of food at a coffee place in my life. this place is a must!looking for a boutique cafe with trendy coffee shop vibes ? check out cupitol in streeterville near navy pier. it has a very european feel to it. life is slower here. the food for a cafe is above average if not almost elite. good mix of healthy, unhealthy, light, and hardy options. the vibe is outstanding. the service and cooking is slow - you have to know going into it is going to take 20 minutes for your food - so don't come in a rush. they do take out so if you call a head it can be ready to go. we like grabbing brunch or lunch here. few of our favorites: basil gnocchi, little potatoes, burgers (trust me they are good!), or even a traditional breakfast burrito.this is a fun & classy "fancy coffee & lunch" fast-food type place, & while the drinks & food look fancy & delicious, they seriously fall short on both quality and flavor.i was excited for my nutella latte.. when i got it, it tasted watery with a hint of nutella. the chicken blt had watery guac.plus side is that the people at the counter were extremely helpful & friendly.it has potential, but needs to step up on flavor.pretty disappointing. i got the non fat chai latte from here and there was just a ton of cinnamon on top and zero chai flavor. literally all i tasted was cinnamon.... i get a better non fat chai latte from star bucks, sad to say.i also got a cinnamon roll which i ate about half of. the frosting was a decent cream cheese frosting but the actual roll itself once there was no more frosting was dry and tasteless. the ambiance seemed ok in there... a lot of people working and chilling, definitely seems lok e a place i could come to and get work done... but not drink any of their stuff. needless to say... i won't be back here.sticky bun french toast was unreal.  our group ordered blueberry lemon pancackes, mushroom spinach omelette, hashbrowns and a sausage gravy variation on eggs benedict.  everyone loved their food.  quick friendly service, as well.everything is so good here.. -visit #1: i loved the atmosphere, spacious room, multiple levels of seats, comfy chairs and couches, perfect for studying or chilling. regular black coffee or lattes were not my favorite here. pecan minitart was addictive especially with black tea. staff are pleasant. would come back. - visit #2:so hard to find healthy options in streeterville neighborhood if you dine out. so me asked the lady behind the ipad and she recommended the avocado wrap. avocado wrap has scrambled eggs, hass guacamole, queso fresco, pico de gallo and wheat tortilla.. portion is very well-studied, japanese style. i really liked this wrap a lot. coming back..- visit #3:i tried almost everything on the menu!! i tried all the tea selections. my favorites are the cinnamon saigon and white tea. served with with a bottle like a french press pot, their teas are so good!. tried the tuna sandwich and it was so good!. coming back..fast forward 2 weeks of similar encounters. this place is just amazing!! they opened around spring of 2017. they're open 7 am- 9 pm. it can be very crowded on weekends. original branch is in evanston. the owner lived in europe for like two decades so you can feel there is some european touch to the place. what i recommend here is everything. my favorites are the avocado wrap, european granola berries breakfast, saigon cinnamon tea and falafel burger!! don't forget the freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice. they do have amazing croissants.great cafe with a variety of drinks and food. great for studying, hanging out, or casual meal.i've only ever been here to study. there is a ton of seating, so i've never had trouble finding a seat. and the table-space is large enough that i can spread my papers and laptop out. one negative is fact that there are not many outlets, so i would recommend having your electronics charged if you plan on staying for a longer bout of studying. the wi-fi is free and easy to connect to. in my experience, it's also pretty fast.i have tried the falafel burger, cheeseburger, fries, and grapefruit juice. i think they're all delicious, decently priced. the burgers with fries make for a hearty meal, but i don't really have any leftovers. i like that they have a lot of juice options (though i think that their cold pressed green juices are overpriced), because if i'm not feeling a coffee, that is my go-to, and not many coffee-shops/cafes have them.if you just want some water, they have a side-table with taps for both still and sparkling.overall, i really like this place, and look forward to trying more of their food, since i've liked so many of their other foods.i was visiting downtown chicago last weekend and i stopped by cupitol to have some coffee and charge my phone. i had the nutella latte, and a cheese biscuit. it was good. the nutella latte is not too chocolaty but it was good cup of coffee. the place itself is nice and clean. unfortunately, they don't have a lot of areas to plug your phone. the service though was amazing. everyone was so nice!!i love this place. they have lots of coffee, smoothie, juice and food options. they also have lots of seating and overall is bright and well lit, which makes it a good place to do work / study. the music can be a bit loud at times if you're trying to get work done, however, if they stick to instrumental music it's not bad. overall, recommend this as a coffee shop to do work.this latte is on point!  i was about to go to a nearby coffee shop which i liked just fine and told a newly local friends i was in his new neighborhoid getting coffee. he promptly suggested cupitol as his nearby preference. so thankful he did!  ambience is cool with instrumental music with a beat playing, a good mix of tables, comfy chairs and high tables. though most people were solo this sunday morning, i could see this location being adaptable to chill time alone with a book, meeting a friend or two, or work/study time. i grabbed a scone. the selection of flavors was to tempting to pass up. some traditional like maple pecan, some a little more unique like ginger lemon and they even offered a savory selection cheddar-apple.a case to the right contains fancy european-looking treats. from the looks of other guests tables, i'll have to come back and try a sandwich or juice concoction!if visiting chicago like me, walk the extra few blocks for your coffee at cupitol and you won't be disappointed.cupitol has it all! technically an all day lounge, they have a surprisingly extensive menu (including alcohol). i dropped in sunday morning to grab a coffee and get some work done. it was busy, but i was still able to get a seat just fine because the space is expansive. everything is ordered up at the counter, and if you get food they'll take your table number and bring it to you. they also clear your table for you when you're finished. which was great because they were really on top of their game and everything was super clean/organized.it was hot this morning so i went for an iced latte (16 oz) and an avocado wrap. came out to ~$12. both were perfect and i'd get them again. other yelpers have noted higher prices but i'd argue the quality was great and this is a main drag to navy pier - i can only imagine how much it costs to lease this location. so i can only hope they're here to stay, because from amazing customer service to great food and drinks, cupitol is doing everything right and it's working.we love this spot for lattes and loose teas. it's a great atmosphere for kicking back and unwinding, or even completing some light work. cozy, clean, spacious cafe with ample seating and latte: 5 (the crema was beautiful and the espresso had the perfect notes)freshly squeezed grapefruit juice: 5cinnamon saigon loose tea: 5  (teas are served in a french press.)avocado egg wrap with wheat tortilla: 4.5service: 5sigh!yet another lukewarm latte when we popped in to see friends off to the airport. the ridiculously overpriced gravlax bagels ($9.00 each) arrived with a tiny, bologna slice of pale "house cured salmon", a teaspoon smear of caper-flavored cream cheese and ribbons of cucumber on a tough, chewy bagel. i'm officially done - too pricy. too tepid.delicious little cafe. even though it is a cafe, my food took restaurant time to be ready tho. i just ordered an omelet but it wasn't ready for 30 minutes, which sucked because i was kind of in a hurry. i don't know if it was just a fluke or not, but the staff did apologize for the wait. i had the spanish omelet and it was really good, especially if you love breakfast with a light kick because it has spicy chorizo and jalapeños.no pokémon around tho...  which was a bummer. only 4 stars.excellent breakfast! i've never had such fluffy eggs! this was or first stop after landing in chicago and boy was it a great welcome to a great city! in addition to the fluffy eggs the hash browns were also the crispiest and butteriest. maybe i was just really hungry, but i think this was one of my top 3 breakfasts ever! also, the iced cinnamon tea is amazing! unlike anything i've ever tasted before. please stop here if you find yourself in chicago!such a cute cafe and great study space! there are tons of tables and lots of natural light. however, there are not a lot of outlets so come with your electronics charges! i've only tried the cappuccino so far and it was very good. everything on their menu looks quality. definitely a place to check out!cool little brewery that just opened in river east. it's a bit pricey, but hey it's the neighborhood. they have a pretty wide menu of coffees, teas, juices, assorted food and sandwiches, plus they serve wine and cocktails, which i'm never opposed to lol the main positive aspect is that it's a place in the area where you can hang out and chill, since there really aren't a whole lot of places like that in the area so close to the lake/navy pier. several people were there just chilling. didn't order anything fancy, just a grapefruit juice, but i look forward to returning since i go to the river east theater all the timecupitol is one of the few coffee shops where i can sit for hours and get work done. they have good coffee - i especially like the nutella latte - but the food is really where cupitol shines. they have a lot of options for a coffee shop, and the portions are huge - you get a lot for your money. some of my favorites are the spanish omelet and the sweet potato curry bowl. all their breakfast sandwiches are delicious as well, and their hash browns are to die for. they have tons of seating, the lighting is fantastic, and the music is good without being too loud. the only negative is that there aren't enough outlets, so you have to get there early to grab a spot near an outlet if you need power.really lovely atmosphere: open, spacious, tons of light and plenty of tables. i had a small latte- well made and not super milky. husband got the nutella latte, which we thought was just ok. we both had croissants and thought they were delicious and flaky. we'd definitely come back!pick your table before ordering your food cuz you'll have to give your table number.wanted to meet up with a couple of gal pals where we weren't sure of our timeline that evening so cupitol popped up in my search as an all day lounge. sounded great to me, as it was definitely going to be a chill atmosphere and we can could hang for as little or as long as we wanted, evening potentially having dinner there. i really enjoyed their menus. they really have it all from brunch to dinner and coffee/tea to smoothies to alcoholic beverages, not to mention their delectable selection of pastries. while they had various options, it wasn't too overwhelming and i appreciated their focused menus, as they had a distinct identity.their space was lovely...very open with various seating options. we opted for the comfy sofa area in the middle. it was a wednesday evening and it was comfortably busy. many customers were working on their laptops while others, much like us, were chit chatting our night away.we ended up staying for dinner and sharing the chips & guacamole and a side of mac & cheese. i also got the tuna nicoise salad and one of their greek beers. portions were much bigger than i thought especially for a café and especially for the area, so this made me really happy. all the food was solid. not knock my socks off amazing but quite satisfying, especially for a café where you usually get just a sandwich at most - not to discount sandwiches but cupitol seemed to value all their options, not trust traditional café items. food was overall good and fresh.my friend got their refreshing cucumber drink. she waited a long time for this (20 minutes) and when she went up about to inquire, the guy that took her order seemed to rush in the back, so it seemed like a honest mishap in which he forgot. it came out shortly after and my friend really enjoyed it. when placing our orders, service was good. staff also regularly came by to clear our table.will definitely keep cupitol in mind, and would not mind at all coming back for dinner, but would come here any time of the day. i really enjoyed the all day lounge concept.location location location! my husband and i are so happy to have this new addition to streeterbille. secondly we adore the chill vive that this coffee shop has. the moment you go up the stairs and into the place, the music is on point and the beautiful chic modern industrial decor is very nice. we love to sit by the large windows and enjoy the luxurious chairs and the seating arrangement. the only thing that is missing is a fireplace (come on we are in the midwest). the reason i am giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because they went so far to create a great atmosphere, but they fell short by not creating that warm toasty feel with a fireplace. with the huge windows, lots of cool air comes thru and we have to keep our coats on in order to enjoy that area. im glad they decided to tie in the decor and keep the history of this building alive with a twist of modern chic. this building was conste back in 1905 thru 1920 and it used to be an industrial warehouse. we have not tried their food yet, but we did try the chocolate almond croissant  and it was delicious, the plain bagel was a bit small but it was nice. the lattes were also very good and the art work was on point. we enjoyed the atmosphere so much that we stayed longer than we had planned. so we ordered another round of lattes and this time we each tried something different. i ordered the nutella latte which was very tasty, i actually enjoyed it a lot. my husband had the moca latte and he was very happy with it. overall it was a pleasant experience and we enjoyed the friendly service from the cashier, to the lady that picked up our plates she was super sweet and very polite.delicious and relaxing lattes. atmosphere was cheerful and light, i requested to turn down the ac and they quickly responded to make it more comfortable for us. i wish they had a fireplace, would make this place even more inviting. the almond chocolate croissant was yummy and very flaky with the right amount of chocolate. definitely recommend this place for a nice cup of coffee, lunch or just to unwind for a break you can thank me later.cupitol is the capitol of all things brunch!  this cute, quaint restaurant gives a fresh take on your favorite dishes but especially brunch.  the decor is trending & relaxing with high & low top tables & a lounge area with comfy sitting chairs & couches.  as for the food it is so delicious that even the leftovers taste as good as when you first ordered them and that's rare.  i ordered the berry mascarpone with scrambled eggs & fresh home-cut fries & when i tell you it's like a party in your mouth you better believe me.  the berry mascarpone had two thick pieces of french toast adorned with a berry medley & a cream cheese infused between the two pieces of toast.  it's a healthy portion but delicious non the less.  the flavors were just the right touch of sweet but not too sweet that you felt like you were eating a dessert.  and the home-cut fries were fresh and lightly seasoned with salt and oh so delicious.  i was surprised that i was able to equally enjoy the food in the day because leftovers don't usually wow me but these leftovers were still good & tasty!now to the cocktails...i really enjoyed the refreshing cucumber.  the blend of bourbon, ginger ale, cucumber, & lemon juice.  it wasn't too sweet & the blends of flavors really complimented each other.  this drink is truly one for summer.  light, cool, & refreshing!!!  it was my first visit here but it definitely won't be my last.  i'd rate this place with 2 thumbs up, a snap, & in z formation (a little in living color humor but you catch my drift...i loved the place!!!)lolsuper place, lovely staff and caring people, nice atmosphere!!!even a place for your puppygreat selection of food items and drinks, lots of nice seating, and friendly staff! we ordered the matcha latte, mocha latte, benedict, and the sweet potato bowl.the matcha latte was not overly grainy with excess powder. it was very creamy and had a nice balance between the sweetness from the soy milk to the slight bitterness of the matcha powder. it was a great sip to start the morning!the mocha latte was rich, creamy, and perfectly chocolately! it was not overly sweet and satisfied our sweetness craving well for the morning. the foam on top was very rich and luxurious. every sip was heavenly!the benedict came with two very generous patties. the gravy was also very flavorful and delicious. it was one of he more hearty items on the menu. the sweet potato bowl was nice and hearty, but a little bland. since there is a lot of brown rice, there was not much seasoning unless your every bite had a chunk of sweet potato. the vegan curry is a nice touch, but a little on the soupy side and needs to be more rich and creamy to add more flavor.10/10 i love this place. i can spend all day here, and i often do. it is the perfect spot to study. the wifi is fast, they have coffee refills, and the vibe is amazing. cozy, clean, and beautiful. one of the larger coffee shops that i've been to in chicago with a lot of different options for seating. outlets are a little sparse so if you are planning to camp out make sure you charge your stuff before coming! food is amazing and you get a lot for the price. i've tried the spanish omelette, breakfast sandwich, brownies, and chai latte. all of which have exceeded my expectations. the portions are hearty and the service is pleasant. i will be back.i found this place on instagram and told my husband about it because it's two blocks from us and the food looked good. we came in today as first timers and we ordered off the menus. we sat waiting for our food for about 30-45 mins for a waffle, bacon, and omelette with toast, that was flag one. then they brought our food to us in to-go boxes! we told them we were dining in. so they took the food out the containers and brought it to us and our food was sooooo cold and the waffle was very hard. my husbands omelette was cold, toast cold and they brought me another waffle out but it was hard as a rock and i had to drain it in syrup to make it soft but that didn't help much at all! not to mention the server didn't bring me any syrup so i had to walk up and ask her for some and she handed me the jar or syrup. pretty as the picture - perhaps? experience - i'll pass!amazing decor + amazing smoothiestumbled into this joint while wandering back to downtown chicago from navy pier, was very impressed by the decor. the whole place just felt right. high ceilings, a variety of seating options, a perfectly tucked away counter that was right along the entrance. they put a ton of thought into the layout! if i was a local i would definitely spend a lot of time here, even the water dispenser was awesome, with sparkling and still!i was not hungry so can't comment on the pastries but the prices were reasonable and the showcase looked amazing! i had an iteration of a green monster smoothie, with avocado, reasonably priced and delicious!i was so high on this place... great food, friendly staff and comfortable ambiance. but, i stopped going in because of some inconsistencies with food. i popped back in today and again was underwhelmed. i ordered a tuna sandwich and the tuna salad was the consistency of dip for chips. argh...spacious cafe/study spot that just opened late march 2017. parking can be difficult/expensive around this area since it is near navy pier/touristy spots. i got the roast beef sandwich here and it was delicious. service is fantastic and fast. i like that they have two types of water (still and sparkling) on tap for you to enjoy. if you get a cup of joe, you're allowed up to 1 free refill.only down side is that this place doesn't have outlets for you to charge your laptops (probably to limit the dwelling times of patrons)..there is one outlet in the entire place so if you're really in need of electricity, you can sit there. by evening, they dim the lights so it gets a little more romantic.it is still new so the place isn't too crowded but i see a lot of potential in this place once the words start spreading.i was hoping to find a nice, non-pretentious coffee shop in the river north neighborhood. unfortunately this is not the place. i came in on a sunday afternoon, the place was not busy, over half of the tables were open so i opted for a two person table by an outlet (trying not to take up more room than i should). when i went to order, i was greeted with fake smiles and judging eyes, maybe i was under dressed in my sunday casual ‍. when i was half way through with my meal some (maybe a manager?) came over to me and told me there were designated spots to be on a laptop before 3pm (it was 1:30), and that i chose a table with white writing instead of yellow writing - which denotes the spaces you're "allowed" to be on your laptops. that's it. no signs, pictures, or anything i could find at first glance that told me this. silly me for thinking coffee and a quick bite while trying to lesson plan should be an easy venture. it was not. i can't imagine coming here again. this just in. as i'm writing this, the manager is coming around again to a large table to inform them of the same. this time he had a sign though. it's under the guise of being reserved explicitly for diners... i ordered a full meal. it is clear they care less about keeping paying customers and more about keeping an aesthetically pleasing restaurant. also, don't order the falafel burger, it is far too salty to enjoy.i stopped in for a coffee and ended up trying the "cortado", which is 2 shots of espresso and an equal amount of steamed milk. it was delicious. it wasn't acidic or harsh at all. i also picked up a mini berry tart, which was delicious. i would definitely come back here. the food looked good too and there were a number of people having meals during my visit.really wanted to like this place. understaffed with unclear instructions on how to be served or where to sit. you order upfront and seat yourself. the hostess is often cleaning tables and can't seat you.food was very underwhelming. good at price point but food was dry and otherwise tasteless.disappointing but the location is by the river and the lake. kanela is across the street.pros:- it's decorated beautifully!- spacious and wide enough so that you don't overhear every conversation- there are comfy sofa chairs to lounge on, but also tables and chairs too- coffee and tea are both great!- the tiramisu cake slice was spot oncons:- none i can think of at the momenti usually patron cupitol in evanston and was super excited to see another one close to my hotel during a mini staycation. the one downtown does not have a bakery and is actually smaller. we tried to get a table but a table for a party of five would have took forever. waited 30 mins. for take out after being told it would take only 15 mins. literally walked down the street back to our hotel and the food was ice cold. we had pancakes in our order but was only given jam. spent $74 bucks on everything and it was mediocre. i and my party was very unhappy but ate because we were starving after waiting so long.simply the best breakfast place i have been to in a while. felt like the cool kid again. great space, great vibe and great food and coffee. even with kids. only one bit of critique if your going tell me, you will bring my coffee my shortly then its good if it happens 20min later. the coffee was for my wife. when i went to pick up my drink order for myself and my kids my wife's drink order was not ready yet. just i sat down i told my wife we better go get hers as i have feeling they will only bring it 20min later. that is exalted what happened.third time visiting this establishment and it seems to be getting worse and worse. upon my arrival i was asked if i was using a kindle or laptop to determine where i was going to be placed. my previous visits i was able to sit where i wanted without any issues, so this was an aspect that i wasn't too fond of considering i was there to read while i enjoyed my meal. i proceeded to order a matcha latte and sweet potato bowl. i had to wait over 15 mins for my drink as it was over looked and secondly after receiving my drink i come to find out my drink was a cup of milk with a hint of color.  my beverage did not taste at all of matcha which i requested a new one as the one i had had no flavor. new matcha served wasn't made well as i could taste the matcha powder as i drank the beverage.now to the meal, unfortunately i was not at all wow'd at the food. food was average at best. certain areas of my food were really hot and in my opinion appeared to be microwaved. additionally my meal was saturated in the curry sauce with an appearance of baby food than a risotto.  unfortunately i will take my business elsewhere.  had high hopes entering and enjoyed the ambiance but that won't make up for the meal and service i received.  kanela is right across the street if you're looking for a more edible and service friendly meal.f---ing great coffee at "cupitol" bakery.  i kind of hate starbucks. i don't mean hate, i mean kinda hate. maybe it's the line, maybe it's the suspiciously and consistently sticky milk station, maybe it's the vinyl corporate veneer oozing throughout, or maybe is just the trench coat guy master-bating in their bathroom with the door propped open (does that guy even own pants?) conversely, cupitol (worst name ever, sorry) definitely has a notably different feel.  in all fairness i had only stopped in on weekday mornings for a quick coffee and a bite. now i've come full circle and made the weekend breakfast trip.  it's a very nice space with a great pastry case full of croissants of all stripes. they also have cheddar scones. those were worth the trip.  came in on a sat and saw a big line and thought, "my breakfast is doomed!" but, no the line moved along just fine and i was there with coffee and scone in hand in 5. thank god. they also have full sit down breakfast. i had the biscuits and sausage gravy with poached eggs. tremendous. i recommend the trip.excellent menu for breakfast, small bites, lunch or dinner. their beverage selection has great options  in coffee/ tea/ smoothies/ cold-pressed juice. customer service is fair. they are not very clear behind the counter and at times not patient with your questions.cool place i like to study at--food is pretty decent (the sweet potato bowl) and plan for it to be busy on weekendsgreat high quality food and drinks! pleasant cozy  atmosphere, nice staff, very clean place.  highly recommend.this place has everything: breakfast, lunch, and dinner, pastries a-plenty, coffee, smoothies, wine, and beer!! what more could you ask for? their brussel sprouts are crispy and perfectly glazed. their lattes are consistently smooth tasting and beautiful. and their overall service is impeccable!the space is huge, with a variety of seating options from booths to high top tables to velvet armchairs. there is always unique but pleasant music in the background. the wifi is reliable. this all makes for a great study location! would recommend for studying, catching up with a friend, or taking your grandparents to brunch on a sunday.the only reason for the knocked star is because the place is a little pricey. i could get food for similar prices at a nice sit down restaurant, so to cater to the students studying there it would be nice to have a few less expensive options like $5-7 sandwiches rather than $9+loved this little spot. had an omelette that was light and fluffy with fresh squeezed orange juice that was delicious. great pastries too!gorgeous, welcoming space that serves delicious food. if you're in the mood for a hearty breakfast or a quick coffee/pastry to go, come here. if you need a new cafe to get your work done, come here. if you want to enjoy a latte while people watching, come here. breakfast is served late with a variety of options from the indulgent to the light and fresh. we got the shroom omelette (skipped the gruyère due to lactose intolerance; sad i know) and enjoyed the thick toast and crispy hash browns. the breakfast sandwich was also tasty on a delicious croissant but included only one egg, which felt scant. the chai latte was tasty but not extra hot and the orange juice was deliciously fresh. seating is varied and comfortable as well and the space felt like you could stay awhile. there's lots of construction happening outside right now but otherwise, things are great.very nice staff and a good place to study ,chill and relax. i've tried their food here and it didn't seem very special. the lattes are not as good as molly's or kanela. i would recommend this place as a quiet and spacious place to study or to have an afternoon coffee drink with a girlfriend ..they do have some beer and wine on the menu so it can also be a good spot for brunch or after work drinkthis review is for dinner and for the food we had - chicken breast plate & chopped cob salad. the only word i could think of is "bland", two words "very bland". the food tastes nothing at all, but they have some salt and pepper and ketchup on side, so help yourself.such a cute and clean place to have some morning coffee with a yummy and healthy breakfast! great coffee and espresso!! super friendly staff!!! it's a must go place when your in town !finally came across a breakfast location near whacker.. this is an excellent place to start the day.friendly and efficient service with great selection of hot items and baked specialties. will recommend highly.cupitol is a great place for breakfast/brunch or just killing time working. it is a large open space suitable for working. one orders at the counter and they bring it to your table. usually within 5 minutes.  i had the corned beef hash, companion had the omelet with cheese. good meal and very enjoyable.i really really like cupitol! their coffee is extremely delicious and so is their hot chocolate! i love the desserts and pastries here! the croissants are incredibly fresh and buttery, and those verrines..omg...orgasmic. the mushroom burger melt is very good too! the beef patty is very thick and everything is housemade. including the bun! and they fresh cut the fries in house too. on top of the great food, the decor is fresh energizing and eclectic and comfortable. this is the prime location for studying with equally tasting food and drinks! and on top of all that, the pricing is crazy affordable for the area.the picture perfect example of what a great coffee shop/ café should be like!  fun music, plenty of seating, tasteful decor, good selection of drinks and food items plus great touches line self serve water station offering both still and sparkling water make for an excellently executed café experiencei loved this place, but definitely a few things to point out. drinks are super overpriced.  it's chicago, i get that, but damn. mimosas are not $9 worthy.   also, the staff didn't know how to make a mimosa?  two ingredients, how is that even possible???? the 4-star rating is definitely for the drinks.  food - 5 quality - 5, price - 5, wait staff - 5. cashiers - 4, drink makers - 3. the bread is perf. end of story.the quality of the food was average, but the smoothie was expensive and the portions were small. i ordered a 12 oz smoothie and it was $5.50. the food itself is average tasting. not bad, but not amazing. i'm not itching to go back anytime soon.4 stars for the venue, seating and service! spacious, modern decor, high ceilings, and lots of seating!!3.5 stars for their iced teas undecided on their coffee. i had a decaf hot chocolate because i came at night, and didn't want to be kept up with caffeine in my system. wasn't a fan of the hot chocolate (its a 2 right now) so i'll have to come back and try again.fantastic freddo expresso and delish avo breakfast wrap! so good! must stop in and enjoy.breakfast until 2pm =)diverse menu... breakfast, lunch, sweets, pastries, coffee, alcohol... so many options. giant seating. small tables, larger, community table. healthy beautiful plates. would definitely recommend.a nice, hipster semi-diner place in downtown chicago.  when ordering their omelettes, make sure you split them with someone - huge portions. their spanish omelette was very savory, they sure didn't spare any chorizo.i also liked their funky cold coffee in mugs and martini glasses.such a wonderful place to relax.. great vibes.. good wifi.. a stroll from the pier. good smoothies too.. try the one with avocados.. it's the bombcute. quick. delicious. tasty. clean. highly recommend this hidden streeterville gem.cute place but the coffee was weak. i did like that the water was self serve and seltzer was also available.the ambience is very nice - spacious, relaxing, easy to have a conversation or get work done. can not recommend the drinks - i tried the mint white chocolate that tasted nothing like mint and only a bit like chocolate - basically watered down warm milk. that's a pity, because the space is lovely.local indie with great coffee and tasty, healthy breakfast & lunch offerings. we shared the sweet potato bowl and the bagel with lox (gravelox). all excellent except the whole wheat bagel was blah. a multigrain or sprouted wheat option would be an improvement.the savory scone was beyond delicious. the cafe au lait was also on point! the staff was super nice. i enjoyed the all over vibe!olove this place. both brunch and dinner are phenomenal and it is rare to find a place where this is the case. i've tried a lot of things on the menu and have never had a bad meal but my favorite items would have to be the corned beef hash and the chopped salad. i also enjoy that there is rarely a wait unlike other brunch places in the area (cough: kanela).this is a very ideal 2017 coffee shop. it has the perfect layout- you can choose a small table with comfortable booth seating for a lunch date or a larger table for studying/working. you can even snag a seat on couches and plush chairs if you need a comfy break mid-day! the coffee is quality- good enough to enjoy a mug full of black. the food is also pretty great, and even though you order at the counter, it gets served to wherever you're seated! i think this is an excellent community and study-oriented place, so i make it a downtown destination.one of my favorite spots for casual dining - my all time fav is the falafel burger.  it is yummy.  i actually crave it.  they also employ a server by the name of monica who is a super star.  she is friendly and i love seeing her.this is my favorite coffee place in the city. love the nutella late! they also have the best chocolate almond croissant ever! some staffs at the front register are not friendly but the managers and kitchen staff provide excellent service. the food here is decent as well. the gavlox dish must be super popular that they always run out of it when i order! however they gave me some sweet treats to make up for it so i was still a happy camperreally phenomenal food. they take so much care in the presentation too! my favs are the prawns and guacamole as well as yia yia's meatballs. yum!!!relaxing atmosphere infused with coffee scents. good place to get work done or lounge with friends.great! the host is the best! i food is good and the coffee is amazing! i love this place. i come here every morning!great place. very close to navy pier. friendly employees. had the waffle and cup of coffee. both were tasty. will be back!love this cute little coffee joint in streeterville. great coffee, iced teas, lattes, croissants etc. they also have a full menu with sandwiches, salads and more. they offer cocktails and wine in the evening. everything is healthy and creative and really out fo the box. the seating is very comfortable with couches, chairs, high top tables. a lot of people here are working on laptops, it's a friendly environment. i've gotten a coffee, iced tea and smoothie from here and all were fantastic !this is my absolute favorite coffee shop in streeterville. they have an awesome atmosphere with tons of seating and tables, the staff is great, and the coffee/espresso is really good. to add a nice cherry on top, they offer free refills on coffee which seems like a rare find these days. their food is a little pricey (not shocking for the area), but it tastes great and the portions are pretty good. i tried the kale and fennel caesar and the almond croissant and wasn't disappointed by either one. additionally, the really great and reliable wifi combined with the awesome atmosphere makes studying here super easy.this place is....fine. i manage a restaurant so when someone sent me the menu i was interested since they serve similar fare. let me start by saying the food is delicious, fresh and moderately priced for the area.  it's quick service style so no waiter service which i dislike. if you pay with a card you choose then and there what to tip with handy suggestions built right in. i like tipping. in fact i am an over-tipper. however i want to know who i am tipping and what for. having never been here i got the impression that you had to already be in the know in order to eat here. i found it cold and unwelcoming. we had looked at the menu before arriving but when we got there all we saw was the drink list on the board.  we were visibly confused, a fact the staff paid no attention to.  when we finally spotted menus they were only for lunch.  though it was afternoon, we were hoping for breakfast.  rather than asking if we had any questions (we did) the cashier rushed other patrons around us leaving us to discover the proper menus on our own. ordering was simple, yet curt.  no real pleasantries or effort to make a connection beyond taking the order. the gentleman who brought our meal was more pleasant, but again a lot left to be desired.  we shared the country benedict and the sticky bun french toast. both were delicious. worth coming back for, but i wouldn't go out of the way.  my cappuccino was delicious and served with some beautiful latte art, a nice touch. a highlight for me was the self service water taps that offered both still and sparkling.all in all great good, just lacking in kind, attentive service. i would definitely return for the coffee and pastries, especially if i had work to do.  it's a quiet, cozy spot for clicking away on the laptop with a nice snack, but for a full meal or if i was entertaining out of town guests i would go elsewhere.love this place. organic cold pressed juice, great coffee.  had an americano with steamed almond milk...so smooth and rich!  looked pretty too.  local pasture raised eggs.  great cozy atmosphere for coffee alone or with friends!cute spot with yummy food! went here for breakfast and got the avo breakfast wrap. easy to find seating and food comes out pretty quick. they have breakfast all the way to dinner and cocktails!nice bright place with good quality pastries and strong coffee. very friendly environment. kids friendly. love the omelette and home made jam. i'll come back for sure and recommend this place to everyoneupdated review after second visit: as much as i want to love this place for its convenience and casual swank, they still have won me over. i asked for a large coffee with a splash of soy milk. $2.25 for the coffee, and $0.90 for the soy milk. what gives? is soy milk now as valuable as gold? people aren't charged for creamer for a cup of coffee, so why upcharge those that want to have a cup of coffee with a touch of cream, but can't do cream? and not is like i even had the opportunity to over pour soy milk or swindle "extra" soy milk. my coffee cup was poured full, and then a tiny glug of milk was added. i guess i would not be upset if i felt like i got a proper cup of coffee worth $3.50, but i did not. it's a small weak cup of coffee with a glug of soy gold. review after first visit: i am going to have to give this place a second try. i stopped in during the week they opened to grab coffee and possibly a snack for my monster commute to the burbs. the house coffee was fine, but i had to pay extra for a splash of soy milk which was lame. people who drink cow milk don't have to pay extra for cream, why do those with dairy allergies? anyways, the snack option was a no go, nothing available that was dairy free. disappointing because i was super excited to have a neighborhood coffeehouse. anyways, every time i walk by, i see happy people in there lounging about, and the website says there are vegan/vegetarian options. maybe i will wander over and try them for a lunch.tourist in chicago.visiting from la. ordered blta sandwich, party melt and chicken soup. everything was good. place is very clean and tidy. great with my 2 small boys. staff very friendly. do like the filtered water option of still or sparkingthis place is a necessity in this area of town.  i've been staying over here for a week & it has been very helpful.  it's open early, which is important, they have a cozy place to hang, the service is good, they have a wide variety of food options, pastry & coffee.this is one of my favorite places in town. it is right in my building, so it's easy just to slip on down for breakfast on the weekends. the staff is fantastic- they all comport themselves as though they have a personal stake in seeing the customers satisfied. the food is great- the spanish omelette is my favorite, my girlfriend loves the spanakopita (if they haven't run out- it's all cooked early, bakery -style and goes quickly!). and, the coffee is damn good!  great place!it was great to see a new coffee shop move into the neighborhood, which by and large doesn't really offer much variety. after reading the reviews for the evanston location, i was looking forward to trying it out and ended up visiting on three separate occasions.on each trip, there was the expected rough edges with new employees getting the hang of things, which is fine. the design is great, there's a good amount of seating for both tables and stuffed chairs.first trip: purchasing cup of coffeei asked the barista to make whatever was his signature drink, the selection he thought he did best. he made an iced latte which seemed a little ordinary and as it turns out, it was very ordinary. if this was the best there was to offer, it was definitely not worth the effort and nothing to bring someone back. second trip: purchasing whole bean coffeeonce they began carrying whole bean coffee, we wanted to try some out. at first, the employee behind the counter didn't know what i was asking for when i asked if they sold whole bean coffee by the bag. there's the rough edges thing. fine, not a problem. the manager pointed out the only selection they offered and i picked up a 12ox bag for around $17. that's higher end price point so i was expecting it to be great. it wasn't bad but absolutely nothing special and not worth the price.third trip: food (hamburger)nutshell version: it was okay. presentation was great but overall it was absolutely nothing special. for the price point, i was hoping for something much better. after giving it three opportunities, it seems like one of those should have connected but each one fell short to one degree or another. overall, tourists will probably love it but locals should look elsewhere. dollop, a few blocks away, still makes a much better cup of coffee as does goddess and the baker inside navy pier but they don't really come close to matching the food menu.i've been to the location in evanston multiple times and love it, so i decided to give this location a try. wonderful decor and a lively ambiance, with plenty of natural light. a great place to study or chat, with delicious food and drinks. will be back!inviting atmosphere, good music, good brunch, excellent coffee. appreciate that they have complimentary sparkling water and a diverse selection of bites such as sweet and savory bougatsa. there's something for everyone on the menu.in a nutshell: poor service, cold coffee, no outlets despite the pitch that they're "an all day lounge". they don't take names, and someone who had ordered after me grabbed my coffee even though i was standing right there. the guy at the counter was snotty about the mistake, and then my new cappuccino was barely room temperature. internet bandwidth was limited: my email had trouble loading on it and there were only eight other laptops in the place. a poorly thought out table orientation means people are bumping into your seats as they squeeze past you if you sit in the center section.i was really excited that cupitol was opening next door, and was hopeful that this place could become a new go-to spot in my neighborhood. that doesn't look like it's going to happen.cupitol is officially my new favorite breakfast spot. the food is delicious (try the plain pancakes they are delightful and the avacado wrap) and the service is amazing.they have freshly squeezed juices and cocktails in the evening. it's an all day cool lounge with good food and excellent service :)excellent service and delicious coffee. my hubs had a great omelette and hash browns and my country benedict was perfect. the poached eggs on top were probably the best i've had anywhere. they were perfectly runny inside and the whites were completely cooked. that's a hard skill to master. kudos! beyond that... meh. the decor is really fantastic, but the place is so loud. it was a hard adjustment for first thing in the morning. the loud music and loud conversations... it was just a bit much for a cafe for me. i'm only 35, so it's not like i'm an old lady needing complete silence but it was just super jarring. we also tried the french toast and we were sorely disappointed. it was cold (the butter wouldn't even melt) and super dry. perhaps a minute or so in the egg bath to allow the bread some time to soak would prevent that. it wasn't good. still... the service, coffee, and other menu selections made up for it.finally! a good coffee place near the navy pier!! we live right next door and was excited to see this place open up.  place is beautiful, airy and open. staff are so so friendly, especially kristin who took our order. most of all, good food. we were happy with our breakfast sandwich and avocado wrap. oh, and maple pecan scone is great. next time, we are getting their petit fours for dessert. they look so pretty and delicious. also, they have high chairs for your little people. we were pleased to know that they have high chairs since we are always looking for a nice but not crazy kid friendly places (if you know what i mean ;).went there with a large group of people after exhibition. it is a pretty nice and close to navy pier. chai latte was good. coffee was good tooa great cafe. spacious, clean and great service. because i love it so much i hate to see it abused. management, you should not allow people to come in and use the place without buying anything. and people who are rude to staff should be asked to leave.i magically stumbled across this gem on my walk home. such an awesome, chill vibe & great cappuccino! if ever back in chicago i will definitely be coming back.far better than the other breakfast choices in the area. plus they have some interesting lunch and dinner options. the sweet potato bowl with curry is great for example - and an unexpected menu item. they also have very good greek pies - with cheese, spinach, meat or custard. as some others have said their internet speed isn't great and there aren't many power outlets but you can't judge a restaurant by that. overall - a great and welcome new addition to the neighborhood.i didn't realize originally that you sit down first and order at the counter to give them your table number. i stopped by on a saturday morning and it was crowded but not unbearable. i ordered a latte and the smoked salmon bagel on gluten free bread. i really enjoyed the flavors in the sandwich and would love to know where they source their gluten free bread from as i thought it was great. i did think it was a little expensive when taking the upcharge for gluten free bread into account but it would be a nice place to stay and hang out for a bit. while i was there i had a lot of difficulty connecting to their wifi but i noticed that no one else seemed to be having any issue so it may have been a user error.every time place an order to go it is never ready when they tell you to pick it up!  get your to go ordering system together folks!!have so far been here twice and really enjoyed the ambiance! very comfy seating and the big windows give a lot of nice natural lighting. the service definitely has room for improvement tho. there were definitely some new employees behind the counter and the coffee making wasn't very streamlined. had to wait for almost 10 min for my matcha latte. and it turned out to be less hot as i expected. the spanish omelette was very delicious. it had a lot of spices and satisfied my appetite for sth savory. will definitely come back!this place is so good we went back twice during our trip to chicago.   all of us enjoyed our meals and kept speaking about what a great spot it is.   if you are a coffee fan, they make great coffee.  food, service, and atmosphere are excellent.  check it out - you will not be disappointed!this is a public service announcement. if you're from anywhere in the south, you know there's a difference between hash browns and home fries (or any other type of skillet potato). be ye not deceived by some of the restaurants in streeterville that claim to serve hash browns. they do not. what you'll find, upon ordering, are merely diced potatoes or sliced potatoes in varying states of done-ness. most disappointing. cupitol, on the other hand, know what doth make a proper hash brown--shredded potatoes that are griddled until they're golden and crispy on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside. my mouth is watering now. lucky for me (and you) these delightful bits are on the all-day menu.loved the matcha latte and the desserts. the interiors are cozy and gorgeous! highly recommended.great place, the mocha latte and eggs benedict were very tasty. service was very fast, will certainly come back.this place is absolutely great! love everything about it, the food, the coffee and the ambience. although the best part is the the staff. they are extremely patient and genuinely sweet. perfect place to chill with friends or do some work.i walked in and felt like this place just got me. everything you could want for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, coffee, tea, or juice. will be back regularly, already wondering how i can open a third location.i wish i had longer in chicago to stuff my face at cupitol. the orange juice is amazing. we ordered the french toast with berries, waffle with nuttella, and egg benedict. they also have a nuttella latte (not my favorite but the oj made up for it). the staff is very friendly and the decor is right up my alley. i would definitely recommend this if you are up for breakfast in chicago!this place is perfect for lounging and working and relaxing. good food, great staff, love it.finally a great breakfast spot in streeterville!  so good! healthy! and great price! and fresh!this is a cute coffee shop in the heart of streeterville. a very hipster vibe and huge tables with tons of space. coffee is really good but my only complaint is that when you have it for there the cup they serve you ends up making your coffee cold. i got a nutella latte which i highly recommend and it was delicious but cold. amazing breakfast wraps to start your morning off right. overall a great addition to the streeterville communitynice spot around streeterville. the nutella latte is solid and the spanish omelette was tasty. nothing sat heavy - big plus! you order at the counter and then they ask what table you're going to sit at (kinda strange) but things were delivered hot and quickly. will be back.a+ for the kind, trustworthy staff that found my lost wallet and kept it safe in their office. nothing was missing and i couldn't be more thankful that they found it before someone else did. i thought leaving my wallet downtown meant certain death (or at least hundreds of dollars worth of replacements), but i was wrong. thank you!! also, just an awesome spot with great drinks and ambiance. don't know what you could possibly complain about. (soy costing extra is about as "new" as being charged for guacamole in your burrito, come on.) good vibes, good wifi, super clean, plenty of outlets (ask staff if you don't see them), and thumbs up for great cappuccinos from this discerning coffee drinker. & i love that they have something for you regardless of what time you're there - from morning coffee, to lunch smoothies, to dinner, to booze. didn't think it was touristy at all; lived in chicago for many years and i think this is actually one of the only good spots in the loop area (which can often lack in character).the iced coffee was good. the interiors were a little off to me. didn't seem inviting. staff was friendly!i ordered the chopped cob salad ($9) and it was alright. the vegetables were super fresh (no gross wilted vegetables here!), but they were a little heavy on the dressing which made some pieces of the lettuce limp and over drenched. the hard boiled eggs were cooked perfectly. there could have been more bacon. seriously, it was a very small portion...and i love my bacon!everyone around me ordered omelettes and wraps. both looked amazing. i will definitely be back to try them!overall, i am a fan of this place because 1) it is crazy close to my apartment, 2) it is a good place to get work done and 3) prices are reasonable especially given the quality ingredients they use.simply the best breakfast we had in chicago. fresh ingredients well prepared, healthy options, and friendly service makes this our go-to spot in the morning.a really nice place, modern decor, warm wood finishes, very pleasant service and tasty food. a nice spot for a quick stop on a trip to navy pier. we came around dinner time. sweet potato bowl with a risotto-like base was full of flavor. prawns very fresh and hummus with falafel hit the spot. 5 stars for that sparkling water tab, folks!this was a very cute place with great food and drinks. it's different from other places because you go and order your food, but the service is great. fairly priced with good portions too! the cocktails are amazing and taste like smoothies!! definitely coming back here :)way more expensive and not as good as starbucks or even dunkin' donuts. was changed $1.30 for a splash of coconut milk in my small coffee. the nutella latte tastes like subpar hot chocolate.loooove this place! great food, great coffee. i had the spinach gruyere mushroom omelette and a vanilla latte - highly recommend. will be back!this spot is so cute. it's great for coffee, lunch, breakfast, or just a spot to hang out. i tried the mediterranean salad. i really enjoyed it.ambience is nice, plenty of seating and love the huge window for light to shine through. the location is right by navy pier so it serves as a nice place to snack or grab a coffee. they are quite pricey though with their food and drink selection. not the best place to study because it does lack outlets depite the abundant seating. parking is also impossible unless you valet or plan to do some walking.i asked for decaf skim latte extra hot no foam -- 1. tried to over charge me; tax almost a $1. i had to argue with him till he changed it.  2.  gave me the coffee in a real cup and it i could tell immediately it was not hot.  i took a spoon in front of the guy tasted and it was not even warm - tepid at best.  so i told him.  he argued that it was hot -- then takes a thermometer and sticks it in the coffee and insists it is at right temperature.  i kept saying please take a spoonful - he just kept arguing - very rude.  no offer to make it again or give me a refund.  i said, "this is ridiculous i would like my money back," then a woman (probably owner/mgr) stepped in and started ringing up my refund then she proceeded to scream at me that i was never ever to come back in there and go to starbucks.  so much for courteous customer service.i'm the type of person that needs to study with just a "little" bit of background noise to get anything done. cupitol is perfect for that (except during brunch times on the weekend). there's a bounty of seating in whatever work configuration that suits your fancy (arm chairs, couches, stools, small tables, large tables etc) so you'll be sure to find a nice spot to get some work done. there are also large windows in the front that let in a bunch of natural light. a negative that others have already touched on is the lack of outlets but i guess that just means that i should actually spend time writing my essays instead of surfing the internet.newness abounds in this spacious restaurant/cafe.    the ambiance and decor is welcoming and modern. the staff was eager to serve but also still working out some kinks. always wanting to try the latest and greatest i stopped in and got a traditional cappuccino to put them to the test. it was well prepared and the espresso cut nicely through the milk. i can't speak to the food. lunch and dinner options are on the pricier side but nothing outlandish for streeterville. i'll definitely be back.great place as a coffee shop in the morning or brunch with friends. come read a book or study and get work done. lunch and dinner is great for a relaxing option with that comfortable cafe feel with armchairs! the food is a great surprise and everything i've had over the last couple of visits is great.amazing tiramisu, wonderful ambience! great service!!!! out beats cafe michelle any day any time!me and my family love this place its really cozy and the pastries are really amazing, my favorite dish is the breakfast sandwich! you order at the counter and just tell the cashier where you wanna sit and food is delivered to you. you should definitely visit this place and also its other locationchicken noodle soup is yummy, good service and good options. walking distance from hotel which is great and trendy for sureok so i am not a big starbucks fan. so this was what i thought this place would be like but it is not. so much better. and actually very different. the coffee was fantastic. very strong but smooth and rich. i was told it is imported from greece. they have a very high end italian espresso machine obviously imported. see picture. apparently it has to be calibrated daily to get very consistent results. i had a very tasty dish called the sweet potato bowl. it had two poached eggs and kale and of course sweet potatoes with risotto and very fresh! see photo. on the side i had homemade bread with butter and homemade strawberry preservative. oh so european!!! loved it! the water is really good either regular or bubbles from a very fancy reverse osmosis tap. the decor was very nice with plenty of room to spread out and do work on a laptop or read a great book. music was nice and not over powering.  fresh flowers on each table. nice touch. they have so many pastries i was shocked at how fresh they can keep them. i found out that everything is made fresh daily.  good assortment of blended juice and fruit drinks as well as other types of bottled beverages. everything was clean clean clean.  looking forward to my next visit to cupitol!i love the ambience here.  i've only had tea so i can't vouch for the food but so far friendly service and peaceful environment.  great to get work done or hang with friends.  it's an upscale starbucks for sure.review title: please get it together!this has always been a good place to come especially when i'm in the city near navy pier. i usually order the cheeseburger and fries for lunch but i also have had a variety of other items on the menu which have been absolutely delicious. this time around however i ordered the cheeseburger and they messed it up!!!... this is not a $3 cheeseburger... unfortunately i ordered it 'to go'  and left the restaurant i was not able to go back, to  explain their mistake.  also, their bakery items have always been absolutely delicious too! however... this time around it seems as though the quality of their bakery items has changed.... waxy taste! i've recommended this place to several people as i am  in the chicago area often due to work.i hope this is a rare occurrence... but not sure! i would have given it more stars however i'm giving it 3 stars due to the inconvenience that i left the restaurant with an order that was not correct and unfortunately i did not have the time to come all the way back to the restaurant back due to someone else's mistake. get it together cupitol!best thing to hit streeterville in a decade. tasty food, friendly service, amazing atmosphere and biz-class wi-fi. i happen to live next door but i'd drive miles for this place.this location is very busy and there is a wait, but it is apparent that they try. there are many people working in the morning and it is nice that they say "thank you for waiting" when they know it is on the longer side. sometimes when people say that, it helps. i work nearby and go to this location because the baristas are friendly and describe their menu. (its busy and line is long for a reason folks!) thanks dollop for my honey cinnamon latte with soy milk! i tried one of their fall drinks (babe on the rocks? i think) and  it was good but with the weather getting cold, i'll stick to my regular. my only complaint is that sometimes a lot they run out of oat milk, but they explain that this happens to many places because of the demand/production issue. so okay, not their fault.this place has a lot of mosquitos inside, strangely enough.not kidding, during the day in the summer there are dozens of mosquitos swarming around inside around the tables where customers sit. you can see smashed mosquitos on the wall, and other mosquitos trapped(?) somehow hanging out. it's disturbing and disgusting. i've been here half a dozen times in the summer, and it's always the same. never would have thought that mosquitos would keep me from going to a coffee place.ok super annoyed with this place. their coffee is fine not amazing not terrible.i'm giving them 2 stars because of their stale ass bread.  i gave them a free pass the first time it happened. i got a sandwich and the bread was clearly toasted in an attempt to hide the staleness of the bread.  today i got a bagel and again it was hard and stale and absolutely disgusting.  went straight to the trash.thanks for ruining breakfast, dollop.i had a very nice cortado here this morning, and the service was very friendly. i would definitely come back as it's a great location close to the theater district, and the space is very open and inviting - there is awesome natural light if you are into that :)i work right in the building but i'm always here when there's a super long line so once i saw there wasn't a line then i went right in!i know of the design studio (firebelly design) who branded this shop so i was already in love with the aesthetic. i'm always on the search for coffee shops that offer great matcha. this one i can add to the list! they told me straight up that their matcha is unsweetened, but they have flavors that can sweeten the drink. there's a list by the cashier. i got ended up getting hazelnut. it was tasty.it's nice that there's unsweetened matcha so if i am not feeling like sugar then i can get it without sugar. there's tons of places whose matcha is too sweet and i need to drink some water after to clear the sweet taste from my mouth. i didn't get that here! so bonus!overall, definitely worth going to!dollop is an order at the counter coffee-shop with multiple locations south of the river in downtown chicago. there are many coffee options including drips, pour-overs and an impressive tea collection as well.i had a drip coffee which was bold enough, though i still haven't had my fantasy dark, bold, non-acidic, not too bright coffee in chicago.my wife had the green jasmine tea which compared to the one she had yesterday which had a more jasmine/floral presence, this one was heavy on the green and not so much on the jasmine / floral. she remarked she could have just ordered a "green tea".they have vegetarian quiche available (which excite me) along with a veggie dandwich, and a brie sandwich with fig jam (also enticing to me a s vegetarian), but with biscuits on the menu, that's automatically the direction i default to. i had the egg and cheddar biscuit. i asked if they could make it with egg whites and they said "no", they get the eggs this way so it was a bit disappointing to me to learn the food was essentially not made to order. it also tasted a bit-reheated which is kind of obvious to tell with biscuits. it was also too hot when i received it...the cheddar cheese on it was over-melted and didn't have much of a taste. it tasted like i was getting biscuit and egg. cheddar on a biscuit should be not quite so melted so the cheddar flavor shines through.i'd give the place another try if i'm back in chicago...but with so many options downtown it wouldn't be top on the go-to list.the cold brew is amazing! service is friendly with a smile and the sandwiches are fast, tasty and on fleek. it gets very crowded but is totally expected for this area. i seen the staff handle crowded situations in which i would have died. excellent job all around! the coffee comes out faster than this yelp review is posting atm hahagreat coffee. loved that i could have an almond milk latte! but no bathroom!? in a coffee place?i like the two dollop locations in streeterville and gold coast. this location was very disappointing - coffee was bitter, service was super slow, seating was minimal and uncomfortable. one of our drinks was handed over to us while leaking from the bottom and the barista could not be bothered to change the cup.this is the second time i went and again they got my order wrong. when i told this the lady at the coffee machine she was even more upset with me complaining than i was with the messed up order. i'll take the longer walk and go back to. intelligentsiamy first visit was last week. there was a problem with my order. rather than post a negative review on yelp, i contacted them. to my surprise, they responded immediately. and they made it right. a sign of a place that cares about its customers. i will return. thanks dollop. much appreciated.perfect. a cute and mostly comfortable coffee shop. i had a maple latte that was perfect in every way: taste, texture and temperature. it was just pretty. the standard coffee however was a bit bitter and crazy hot. i would likely return to give those bagels a try and i've heard great things about the chai latte!coffee was fine but they don't recycle anything! so much trash that doesn't need to be thrown away. come on guys it's 2018 just get two cans.stopped in and had a small latte. very well executed. the only drawback is that it's served in a paper cup. i know it's part of the american culture but will never be able to get used to that. ambiance is relaxed, nice view of chase plaza from high stools, however,  not comfortable. stools are made for a kindergarten, not even half of my buttocks fit on it and i'm not considered a big person. maybe that's the strategy of the place, in and out.poor service.  ordered a pour over coffee today along w/ a 12oz bag of kenya single origin.  i was told that i would get a free coffee with a purchase of a bag of beans.  i ended up getting charged the full amount for the pour over coffee.  i at least expected a credit for a small drip coffee.  the "barista" also did not know how to pour a cup of pour over coffee.  she probably poured 100 grams of water and then let it sit for over a minute.. helped customers.. poured another ~100 grams... let it sit for 2+ minutes.... and then came back and finished it off.  i feel that dollop is not really a place for specialty coffee...oh dollop, why must you have less locations than starbuck's? especially since you're incomparable. i must have you more frequently, but i guess 5 days a week will be sufficient for now.but in all seriousness, dollop is my favorite for a morning coffee run on my way to work or when i get a 15 minute break between working. in a weird way, i tried to find a reason to not like this place since i don't have one close enough to home (the addiction is real).the coffee is strong and the espresso is the most flavorful i have ever had. it is the only one that does not taste stale or burnt compared to the competitors. also, this is the only place i have ever ordered a latte from and it tasted more like espresso than it did milk. heavenly! which again, is why it is incomparable to any other coffee shop i have found in chicago. i get withdrawals on saturday and sundays.i craved a chicken pot pie one week. i settled for frozen. unhappy with this, i moved on with my life. i went into this dollop for a coffee as it is down the street from my office. i spotted chicken pot pie on the menu. i was shocked. i was upset! i had settled for frozen crap to get my fix. alas, i was not hungry on this day. so i returned on another and got my pot pie of chicken. the meat, so fresh! the crust, so buttery! i've gotten it twice. i force myself to eat the side salad because i'm still hungry after guzzling the pie. but the salad is good too. i recommend this item!!this used to be one of my favorite places. the coffee is still pretty decent though a tad overpriced. but the real winner was he blueberry tea that they carried. delicious just sweet enough blueberry tea. dollop has wrongfully decided to switch to hibiscus tea. now i normally like hibiscus but this tea was watered down and tasted like old gum that has been sitting in water for awhile. do not get it. bring back blueberry.i needed a break from traditional coffee places in the loop (i.e starbucks and dunkin) and stopped in at dollop to give it a try. the hazelnut latte immediately caught my eye and i gave it a try. it was delicious! the coffee can be a little pricey, however it was nice to try something new. the best part about dollop is that it doesn't give off the chain vibe. their baristas are super friendly and always seem to be striking up a conversation with the customers. the location is great and the layout is different. the shop faces the street, which allows the shop to be well lit, while providing customers a chance to people watch.coffee is disquietingly sour and watery. quite too big for espresso and cup was super dirty.best thing to happen to 55 w monroe in years - dollop moving in! staff is super friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. your implementation of oat milk is the bees knees in my honey cinnamon latte. love chatting with the baristas in the afternoon about nothing in particular - and using the ritual app in the morning to get my drink and go. i don't even have to leave the building! :)i visited on a tuesday afternoon.  the place was hopping with downtown employees and folks on their computers.  i ordered a cortado, one of my favorite drinks, and really enjoyed it.  the service was fast.  while i waited for my drink i struck up a conversation with who turned out to be the manager of this location as he straightened up items in the store.  super nice and friendly guy :) this location has the equipment, coffee, and friendly and trained staff to make any visit a good visit.he coffee is always excellent and service is friendly. i like the hipster decor and the bleacher seating. i ordered a breakfast sandwich for the first time today. a sausage biscuit with gouda and caramelized onions. well...my mouth was not ready for balsamic caramelized onions early in the morning. it was a bit of a surprise but it was still good. and the biscuit was buttery, flaky, fluffy perfection.one thing i don't like...the step in the payment process where they ask you to add a tip to the order total (15%, 20%, 25%). i'm a little irritated with baristas getting tips to begin with, but when i only order a sandwich the cashier is asking me to tip her just for taking my order. dislike.best coffee in the area and convenient ordering ahead on ritual, but forget about a quick stop to order in person. when they are slammed the one person making drinks keeps his/her leisurely pace while the employees not doing anything at the register or in the back wander around.dollop is my favorite place to grab a great cup of coffee for a morning treat or an afternoon pick-me-up. they serve metropolis coffee, which is rich and decadent and just downright delicious. you pay a little more than you would at starbucks, but i think every penny is worth it for the quality and selection.i made my first trip into dollop today after passing it almost everyday on my way to work. i judge every coffee shop by their almond milk cappuccino.  if you don't offer almond milk, i won't even order, so props to dollop for carrying it.  i also appreciated the fact that they have harmless harvest coconut water and rx bars.  however, that's where my positive experience ends.  my medium cappuccino was almost $6 and it tasted bitter.  it was reminiscent of starbucks bitterness, which i can't stand. it also had almost no froth.  (i realize it's more difficult to froth almond milk but i assure you it can be done - rom does it perfectly).  i am afraid dollop is 1 and done for me.good americano. i went in the evening so it wasn't crowded. price was about $3 for an 8oz. the inside has great seating for people watching outside. i'd like to go back to try the food and specialty drinks.i had my first dollop experience and will never go back. my latte took too long to prepare and when i received it, it was served luke warm. the team could also use training in sanitation. i saw one of the baristas stick his finger in someone's drink to remove something. the cashier who took my order went to the back to prepare my bagel without washing her hands. no thanks!the coffee here is really good and i'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't due to my recent experience. i ordered through an app called . i got a large coffee but when i showed up, it was small. i asked the barista three times if that was my drink and he said "yes". i left puzzled so i decided to check the app and i did order a large, not small. i felt bad bringing it back but i went in and showed the barista on the app that i ordered a different size. i apologized because i felt bad bringing it back and asking him to make another. he just looked at my app, made a grunting noise, and starting making another. when he was done i said "thanks so much" and he just looked at me like i was an inconvenience. maybe if they would have read the order the right the first time, it wouldn't have had to be remade. i shouldn't have to sad sorry for my drink being messed up.finals week is one hell of a week.. came in here to get my usual iced chai with soy milk that i get from any coffee/tea joint. ordering it from dollop is heaven every sip i take. the chai is so rich and perfect to my taste. i also ordered the everything bagel with cream cheese, red onion, and tomato.. gosh. so good! and the staff is so sweet and lovely (+++)so happy that this location is so close to depaul u, where i spend most of my days. definitely my go-to as of late.idk the coffee is mediocre and the pastries are ugh...i got excited to see a scone and it was the worst chocolate chip scone ever...coffee was just okay..i regretted not going to mcdonald's for iced coffee...would've been almost $1 cheaper and a bigger cup...i really wanted to like this place. bright and cheery and in a good location. but if you charge more than starbucks, your coffee has to be better than starbucks. not the case here. and to top it off, my muffin was not fresh - needed the watery coffee to wash it down. too bad.holy crap the almond croissant. that is all.i gave this place two chances to satisfy me and is has failed on both ocassions. i asked for a large mocha and they pretty much gave me a regular latte. they also messed up my sandwich order of a blt, which is a pretty basic sandwhich to make. if you want to come to a place for a cute instagram pic and waste your money on some inadequate and overly expensive food and drinks, this is the place for you. otherwise, don't bother.i like this place. always vibrant and alive. coffee is good and they do have small selection of food menue.i had drip coffee that was pretty weak.  the medium size is kind of a joke.  it would be a small anywhere else (other than at a place serving cuban coffee).  the coffee is 2 stars but the brie and fig and pear sandwich was a solid 3 star so i rounded up.  i love the look of the place.  it was packed.  i must missing something. i don't quite understand the following but i will try a bar drink next time and hope it packs a better punch than the drip coffee.  free wifi is nice.ham & gruyere croissant and chocolate chip scones were very yummy, but was disappointed that the kitchen wasn't open on saturdays for sandwiches and other things i planned to try ahead of time. overall was a pleasant breakfast and will be returning again. boyfriend ate all my croissant :(slooooow, unenthusiastic service. counter gal wasn't aware if they had chips or not. order was lost. served on the wrong bread. beef was very good (that's all i ate). $11.00 and still starving. never again.this place has good coffee and tasty croissants. i would love to come back!! i had an almond latte from their special coffee menu and got two croissants (one with beef & mustard and the other one with cranberry & peanut butter)~this place opened a couple days ago in my office building. i was excited since i've seen good reviews at other locations. unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. the menu has a lot of great options for both hot and cold coffee and tea options. i saw that almond milk was an option ($0.60 charge), so i decided on a 12 oz. cappuccino. i really like coffee so i prefer a 1/2 coffee, 1/2 milk cappuccino. i know that's not normally an option. most places do 2/3 milk, 1/3 coffee, and that's fine. i watched the girl behind the counter make mine. she poured about 8 oz  of milk out and steamed it. then she brewed one shot of espresso and put it in.. so i paid almost $5 (tax included) for a glass of frothy milk with a tinge of coffee taste. my coworker order a 12 oz iced americano. the same thing. we saw them fill the glass with ice and water, almost to the top and then added 1 shot of espresso. it was so weak, another coworker thought she was drinking iced tea. while i was waiting for my drink, one of the guys behind me ordered a regular 16 oz coffee. they poured a cup with about 12 oz of coffee in it. he was rightfully upset and asked that if he is going to pay for 16 oz, he expects to get them. it's similar pricing to any other coffee shop you might find in the loop, but i did not get what i paid for.no need to really review this place because if they can't have cream and splenda ready and waiting for you they really shouldn't be in business as a coffee shop. love the picnic tables.not a place to go if you value fine coffee properly served.  they serve metropolis, which can be excellent if properly prepared (try goddess and the baker on wabash--they serve metropolis coffee that's even better than metropolis's own cafe).  however, dollop serves espresso in paper cups even if you tell them you are staying there.  the espresso is good, though possibly brewed a bit under temperature.  if you prefer your espresso in a proper porcelain cup, the loop options remain intelligentsia or goddess.i hope they purchase a case of porcelain cups.  i'd be happy to try them again once they've got the bugs worked out.any coffee shop that's able to substitute almond milk is a plus in my book. (nothing against soy, i just don't need an extra dose of plant-based estrogen in the morning.)  their breakfast sandwiches are killer.this is the best coffee i have had in all of chicago and the breakfast options are great.  this is a quality place. i really don't get why americans like starbucks.great coffee, sandwiches, and pastries...their cortado is excellent.  solid business.was pleasantly surprised to see a new location, having previously visited dearborn location long back when i worked more near to that particular area but now, there is a place near my work on monroe! coffee is always great, and the staff are always very friendly and cool.  although there are a lot of coffee shops competing for the morning loop crowd, and choices abound, this is a great place for real coffee lovers.  one small critique though: they have a good food menu but perhaps owing to their signage and name, it might not always be obvious to passerby that they are more than just coffee.great bright coffee shop perfect for a quick cup or an all day work a thon. coffee is good, food is nice and the service is always with a smile. try their pour over coffee, is great and not something you can get everywhere.this place is the best! lattes are always well-made, pastries are fresh, and service is fast and friendly. it's a beautiful new shop with a great atmosphere. i had a large skim latte and an almond croissant, and both were delicious! i would recommend dollop to any tourists stopping by the bean or the art institute as a nice, more local alternative, and also to anyone who works in the area and wants a new regular coffee spot.wow, i just had a wonderful lunchtime sandwich.  well made a fresh ingredients.  yummy and the staff was really helpful.i am giving 3 stars for the coffee. the sausage biscuit wasn't that great for the price they had it athappy to have found a place that locals frequent. friendly & efficient service, varied menu with good espresso, tasty treats, and cute decor!would recommend refining hand-off to make sure there are no used grounds stuck to coffee cups or residual food spreads on to-go containers.overall great experience.what a delightful little coffee shop. the name alone has a warm and comforting feeling. we were staying at the hotel across the street and needed a spot to get some work done on a cold day. atmosphere: clean, well lit, modern. very busy on a weekend afternoon (full of laptops and bookworms). beverages: i did peruse the menu and they have a variety of lattes and hot teas; i was a little disappointed they don't have an apple cider. we both ordered hot cocoa, and it was deliciously rich.price: average; comparable to starbucks.the honey cinnamon latte is my favorite drink here. i recently got the nutella mocha and was slightly disappointed by that one. it just wasn't as rich as i was hoping it to be. they also have some food options, such as sandwiches, bagels and pastries. it's a great place to just stay all day to do some simple work.i love that there is plentiful seating and many outlets for charging. the seats are a little bit uncomfortable, i have to admit. it is a little loud (with chatter and music), so maybe not the best place to go if you really want to concentrate. but it seems like a great place for group meetings, or if you like some buzz in the background while you work. i love the large windows, the bright and cozy feeling interior. it's also great that they still open until 7 even on weekends.i happened to pass dollop on my way to yolk the other morning and it looked cool from the outside, bookmarking it because of the four-star average rating... but, sorry, can't agree with the overall assessment. the drip coffee:  not anything out of the ordinary and not particularly strong. (the complimentary illy dark roast being served in my hotel lobby was far better.)my banana nut muffin:  looked enticing, but had a dense, gummy consistency with a bad mouth-feel.  the service: aloof. let me offer one word of advice - if you don't say hello or thank you, you also shouldn't put a payment screen in front of me asking for a tip. the plus is the tall open space, with seating you can hang out in for a while - but, otherwise, seems like dollop could use an extra dollop of something.this chicago only quasi-small chain has some amazing coffees!  i indulged in an espresso and cold brew this morning and both were outstanding.  the baristas were super friendly and very knowledgeable.   they roast their own beans at another location, and it's noticeable.  kudos dollop!my new favorite spot to get things done!dollop's bright and airy interior has made this my new favorite place to get things done on my laptop. there are tables, a couple comfy chairs, and a high top bar along the window. i was a little thrown off by the wifi asking for a password, but the password is listed on a very small sign by where you pick up your drinks. as for the coffee, it's a little too strong for my tastes. i got the honey cinnamon latte so many other people have raved about, and after one sip i was like whoa coffee! but if you're a big coffee lover, totally check this place out. or if you're nearby and looking for a place to work for a few hours, dollop is a million times better than all the neighborhood's starbucks.this is my go to spot for quick work meeting. i always get the honey cinnamon latte with a little less honey otherwise its too sweet for my liking. it's the perfect afternoon pick me up. it's a little pricey but it's comparable to other places in the area.this cafe came clutch. i flew into chicago on a workday at 7 in the morning. was stuck in a lyft for 1 hour on back to back conference calls. after dropping my luggage off at our hotel, my fiance and i walked a couple of blocks down and came across this place.we were tired, hungry, and desperately needed a place to plug in for work. this place met all the criteria. the vibe was a bit slow, which i needed. the coffee amazing. service was awesome - the baristas were cool and dressed so cute! and the food was amazing (every sandwich comes with a pickle and a really yummy potato salad).lastly, the internet connection was seamless. im happy my fiance recommended this place. super happy we came here.love this place! so much natural light, big and spacious, interesting artwork, and amazing coffee/tea and pastry/sandwich selection. glad to have discovered this coffee shop in my neighborhood. they have free wifi and plenty of study space so plan on spending a few hours here :)i go to dollop all the time just to see these two lovely girls that work there. one is blonde, always smiling and has the freaking best tattoo sleeves. i could talk to her for hours. the other is super stylish and rocks a flannel every time i see her and she's super sweet. they are so nice to me and make the best honey cinnamon latte that i honestly recommend this place for the amazing coffee and the spectacular employees. you'll love them just as much as the coffee!good simple restaurant like starbuck, were students work while sipping coffee.food is good even if choice is limited.not expensive excelent coffee, good and quick service.bon resto simple un peu comme starbuck ou les étudiants travaillent en sirotant un café !la nourriture est bonne même si le choix est limité. pas trop cher, bon service et le café est excellent !best coffee shop in the city. great ambiance and character. there wasn't a line when we got there, but for the 45 min or so we were there the line was to the door. i got the cinnamon hunny latte which was fantastic. the everything bagel w/ cream cheese and avocado is to die for. great service, do yourself a favor, next time your in the city check this place out you won't be disappointed.good location, just a few blocks off of michigan.  friendly staff and a very open feel.  music cast a funky vibe to the atmosphere.coffee was delicious and they offer multiple sandwiches and danishes if you are looking to eat.i will be back for more.overview: amazing food and drinks, great prices, good atmosphere.our group got a variety of drinks from hot tea to iced coffee and they were all extremely delicious.  the make your own bagel is great with several different bagels, including garlic, herb, plain and more, spreads, goat and regular cream cheese, and toppings like avocado, tomatoes and cheese to choose from. the herb bagel is delicious and their portions are awesome. i got a garlic bagel with cream cheese, regular cheese and onion. it was really good!  they also sell lunch sandwiches all day and it comes with a pickle and a very small but yummy side of potato salad. they made our food and drinks pretty quickly and were able to wrap them up to go. the atmosphere was very comfortable and had a typical coffee shop feel.i've been twice and ordered the breakfast sandwich both times. the bread is a piece of heaven. i wanted to order another one after i finished, but i have this conflicting goal of being in shape. i shall return again when my daily calorie allowance lets me! great matcha too!i highly recommend give dollop a try. awesome space and location. the fresh baked bagels are great! i like to drink chai tea. i was a bit disappointed that they chai comes out of a box but it was still decent. the latte aspect was well done. i'll be back!the honey cinnamon latte is fantastic. it had just the right amount of cinnamon. i also ordered a breakfast sandwich which was overpriced and wasn't anything extraordinary. the coffee prices here are very reasonable. they have lots of seating available but it was almost full by 8:30am. this seems to be a great place to study or work remotely.was excited to try this small shop and buy a bag of beans. very cool design and was busy. unfortunately poorly made drinks served from a red headed barista that took ride bariatas to a whole new level. feel sorry for the owners of this shop that the team lets them down. hope we just caught it on a bad day.i believe this is a coffee shop chain in chicago and you must go to one when visiting. they have a list of syrups for your latte - i got the lavender latte! tons of room to sit, work or study! the latte was amazing - we sat on the couch and relaxed for a couple of minutes before we continued our adventure to navy pier. i want to try their food as the menu looked amazing - i'll be back!gr8 place to get some work done or meet up with your peeps! it does get crowded over the weekend but the coffee is bueno and the wifi is reliable. the sammies are quite good (esp the turkey sandwich). there are a number of dollops around chi town but this is my go to one!i love the vanilla latte here! not sour at all and tastes so good! the cold brew was also good. the location was great, and it has outdoor seating which is good for summer! i love the design and decorations of the place, very neat and in fashion. will definitely come back for more coffee!ok place to grab some coffee and get some work done. not my preferred coffee shop to study at, but i live right across the street, so very convenient for me. there are a couple large tables, seating about 10 people at max each. there are two bar seating areas against the windows. a few couches and armchairs. and then a couple tables for two people. on the weekends it can be pretty crowded, so it might be difficult to get a big group in here. usually, if i'm studying by myself, i can find a place to sit. many of the chairs are wobbly and not the most comfortable. some of the tables are tall enough to be standing-desk-height, which is great for those who don't like to sit when they work, or would like options.coffee is fine, tea is good. sandwiches are ok. i don't think any of the items they serve are extraordinary.main complaint is that no matter what season, it's always freezing in there. i often have to wear my actual coat from outside in doors. does not make me the most productive studier when i'm shivering.one good thing is that they have two walls with full windows, so there is a lot of natural light that gets in.had a delicious mexican spicy espresso coffee and an everything bagel with aioli! amazing, people were nice but under staffed.this location is spacious and lots of natural lighting (thanks to the ceiling high windows on two sides). free wifi. coffee is decent. baked goods are ok. haven't tried the sandwiches yet, but will one of these days. service is good. my preferred drink here is the honey cinnamon latte. good spot to grab a cup of coffee and read.dollop has a lovely modern atmosphere with a very very high ceiling and cute comfy seats. all-glass wall windows facing the east and being located between streeterville and atwater's towers, makes a wonderful coffee shop for a morning sit down with friends before they go to o'hare (the usual time i come here) or if you want to work on laptop. their coffee is just ok. spicy cinnamon latte was good. nutella mocha was good too. i prefer starbucks reserve coffee over coffee here, but the atmosphere here is the best. baristas are not that friendly here to my experience so far. snooty is the best word. this place is most perfect for a college student, a resident or fellow working on a research project or for a gathering with coffee vampires friends.i got iced latte, the coffee was really good. the service, not so much. the person who took my order didn't even look up the entire time, and the place wasn't even that busy. disappointing. i'd have liked to come back because it has a great vibe going on and is actually very spacious, but i won't. i like the service better in the west loop one.sooo i yelped a coffee house being a tourist in chicago and not wanting a starbucks. thanks to previous yelpers i was very pleased with the moment i walked in the door. the industrial vibe and unique menu were exciting.. i didn't know what i wanted and the 2 gitls behind the counter helped me with some explanations and suggestions. i went with the cold latte with oatmeal milk...because they were out of almond milk. lucky me because it was decadent, creamy, smooth and rich with flavour and depth...it took me an hour to drink it. knocked starbucks out of the park!!  the coffee jousecwas full of energy with computer techies and  couples enjoying a quick conversation before going back to work. bright blue chairs on the patio with dog bowls of water were inviting. bathrooms were newly decorated, homey and very clean. there is a reward program for frequent flyers visting there locations in uptown, lakeview, streeterville (x2), evanston, the loop (x3), ukrainian village, and now hyde park.   come for the vibe, the fresh eggs, meats and ukrainian pastriesi've been here twice and and both times i ordered coffee. the first time i ordered the mexican mocha w/ 3 chile blend and it was pretty good! what i liked about it was that it was different from your typical coffee and the chile blend gave it strong distinct spicy flavor. it kinda confuses your taste buds haha (but in a good way in my opinion!). the second time (today) i ordered the honey cinnamon latte and it was pretty good! not as wild in flavor as the mexican mocha but  definitely something i would order again this fall. it wasn't packed either times i've visited. people usually come here to study or get work done.there is a cute little couch area that is usually always taken, tables with outlets and outdoor seating for when the weather is nice! i really liked the layout and vibe of this coffee shop and if i lived around the area i would definitely consider getting work done here!this place is so great that we made two visits while we were visiting chicago.  our first visit was for brunch bagels and coffee.  the bagels were perfectly toasted, sliced, and topped with our choices of toppings.  they were quickly prepared and totally hit the spot!  my cappuccino was a dream-- not only was it a work of art, but it tasted delightful.  the espresso base was complex and fragrant.  our second visit was for an afternoon caffeine recharge.  we knew the coffee was a hit, so we ordered an iced coffee and a cappuccino again.  again, the orders came out quickly and exactly how we had ordered.good spot to sit down, grab a coffee, and get some work done. the coffee is good, not super fancy but affordable. there's plenty of seating and tons of variety - from armchairs to couches to high, communal tables. the place is always busy with students and working professionals, so expect a wait.only come here for the bagels, because the coffee is not as tasty as what i am used to. still not bad lattes though. their coffee is locally sourced. i am more of an adventurer kind of guy so i love trying new places. they do stack up on the cream cheese, so all the time we have to scrape half of it off. no biggie just a bit messy. it's locally close by us so that's a plus. they also do a neighborhood discount with proof of your high rise fob.great spot for pour over and mexican mocha. friendly and informative conversation with sam. got some info on what to check out as a clueless tourist from nyc. cheers. keep killin it dudettes. :)if you want your stuff stolen, dollop is the place for you. i used the credit card that was stolen about an hour before (inside dollop), and realized the theft happened while still in this establishment. to save you readers from judgement, i'm very careful and cognoscente about my belongings, but that was no match for this level of white-collar crime. to add insult to injury, the manager was very unhelpful and immediately informed me that the security cameras do not work. so, i'm assuming they're in on it, probably to make up for their low hourly wages.best spot for coffee...the honey cinnamon late is excellent and the dirty chai latte is made to perfection. this casual coffee shop has high ceilings and a nice industrial looking. their personnel are friendly and attentive. try it you won't regret it.i love dollop but be warned that this location is super slow in the mornings. they only have two people working and they do all orders, coffee and food. i probably spent longer getting a latte here than my taking a my bus from union station. definitely a lot slower than other locations. good place to do work though hence the three stars.came  in with high expectations on how a coffee roasteries should be doing a pretty latte art but it came out with no latte art at all.love this coffee shop.  coffee is delicious, chocolate scone is perfect, staff friendly, and the location and vibe is great.  go here every time i am in the area.cute coffee shop in the streeterville area with decent coffee and plenty of room for studying.i love the large windows and the high ceilings. it's the perfect spot for to chill, study, or get some work done. it wasn't too packed on a tuesday afternoon, and there were many available seats. seating also varies from couches, tables, bar stools by window seats - so there's something for everyone. wifi is reliable and solid.i ordered their honey cinnamon latte special - it was good, but too light for my taste since i like darker roasts.great environment to study at, very peaceful vibe and open area. i ordered the nutella mocha, matcha latte, and roast beef sandwich. drinks were ok, tasted a little watered down, but the sandwiches were very tasty and included potato salad and a pickle.i'm so glad found this coffee shop on yelp during my visit to chicago! the baristas were super friendly and they had tons of non-dairy milk options. i loved my oat-milk honey cinnamon latte! i can't wait to come back to chicago and bring my husband here!not sure who was helping these other customers that raved about great customer service because i was just in here for the first time from out of town and these guys were awful. both female and male behind the counter were silent, unhelpful and made no attempt to let me know when my iced coffee was ready- it sat there on the counter, while my family of four waited with me. yes, the gal behind the counter told me she'd let me know when it was ready which is why i wasn't hovering over the counter waiting. seemed like a cool place- nice atmosphere, and good menu but i'd never go back. try smiling to your customers and acting like you give a sh*t they're standing in front of you next time.this was the second dollop i visited and i was not disappointed. located in a great and safe area, it was a clear hub for many students, tourists, and office workers. a girl named sam took my order, and suggested i try it with a shot of vanilla (delicious!) again, very kind people. the interior was modern and had lots of different types of seating. they also had some souvenirs and bagged coffee available for purchase. i went to this location twice in my 3 day trip. i recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to get their fix!the best almond milk latte i've ever had!! the coffee is really great, and i also loved that the almond milk was sweeter than usual. the atmosphere is also so cute and the staff is super friendly and helpful.dollop coffee has a lot of charm; i really enjoy both the coffee and the variety of options on the menu.every time i visit the line is never more than a few people long. the baristas are quick, yet efficient. i've always been impressed with the balance of the drinks. i've tried both the soy latte and the nutella mocha.the nutella mocha is my favorite! once i tried it, it became my go-to. it's creamy, smooth, and rich. the sweetness level is actually perfect - you get a little bit of the sweetness from the nutella, but the coffee and non-sweetened milk balances it out nicely. the cafe always seems full, but i never end up having a hard time finding a seat. this seems to be a favorite study/work spot for a lot of people. the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. there are both big and small wooden tables, a couch, and two arm chairs. as other people mentioned previously, the crowd is mixed and there are plenty of outlets. free wifi is always a plus.i don't even live in streeterville and yet i find myself visiting this cafe often. it's definitely worth checking out dollop coffee! :)pros:good and friendly service large selection of flavorful coffeedecent price free wificool atmosphere cons:busy (hotspot for students)can get loud and crowded depending on the time/dayseating is not the most comfortable can get a little coldi went in about 11am today. two female workers. i ordered a sandwich. the girl who took my order and rang it up was so unfriendly and no thank you at all. i was just standing around and i noticed the other girl toasting the bread. i asked them not to toast it. they seemed annoyed at my very presence much less asking for my almost $10 sandwich to be made the way i want it. i got it to go. when i ate it a little while later the bread was so stale i now know why they want to toast the bread. who's the manager/owner of this place? you should teach your employees customer service and check the food to make sure it's fit to serve.there is another coffee spot near by on illinois street called "cupitol coffee and eatery" and a starbuck's on ontario street close by. i will go anywhere but here next time.i am a bit conflicted about this place. we stopped by as we needed a quick coffee in the morning. partner got the cortado with coconut milk and it fell flat. nothing remarkable. just basic. i got the mexican latte with three chili, which i thought was great but slightly too heavy on the cinnamon. i don't think the barista enjoyed her job; she had the most apathetic affect during our brief interaction. when ordering, i neglected to correct her when she said "mexican latte with almond milk." i am unsure where she got the almond milk from because i never asked for the substitution, but it was my fault for not correcting her. i am also unsure if the replacement made the latte feel less rich .. regardless, it was a nice drink but not enough to cause me to return. i would much rather drink jacques torres' wicked hot chocolate. would i recommend? sure if you're in the neighborhood but there's nothing extraordinary. ambience is a standard coffee shop - lots of people from northwestern having meetings here, students working on their computers, etc. i guess it's chilled  from the vibes of its patrons, but their barista was unwelcoming.nothing special, nothing bad. just an average cute little shop to drop by while waiting for a nearby brunch reservation. not a coffee shop i would go to get some work done tho, moreso a catch-up or to go spot. the lines can be a little long but i went on sunday morning so not sure what it'd be like on the weekday. just on the street parking so you may have to drive around to find someplace to park.i stopped in today with a friend for the first time and had a turkey sandwich and a nutella mocha. while i enjoyed both the sandwich and the beverage, i will not return to this location due to the poor customer service. the cashier was cold and rude to me when i asked her for skim milk. instead of saying that she didn't hear what i was saying, she responded by rolling her eyes at me, shaking her head, and stated "what? we don't have that!" finding it difficult to believe that a coffee establishment doesn't have skim milk; i repeated the request, which her coworker heard from further away, and jumped in to assist. no apology was offered, and in fact, i gave her an apology for making her so upset. there were no lids stocked to fit my medium sized cup, there were no forks in the utensil holders, and the garbages were overflowing. i loved the atmosphere and product offerings, but i'll take my business somewhere that treats customers with a bit more respect.great place to have breakfast at the ohio street.  with very few vegetarian options being the downside, we went for a veggie sandwich, a brown sugar almond cake, and cortado. the sandwich tasted good and fresh. however, it had an unusually large piece of red pepper. but the rest of the veggies came together very nicely with the bread. muffin was great. not very sweet - just right. cortado, however, wasn't so great as we have had better ones before.the place is quite busy in general but not so much of wait compared to other known places for breakfast in the vicinity. the staff is quite friendly and quick on service. seating can be improved as most of the seating here is high chairs. overall, a good and less crowded place to have a decent breakfast.after exploring the tourist areas in downtown chicago, we found this coffee joint.  it was a welcomed and needed change in temperature from the cold outside. plus, it was great for my footsies to take a break.  inside the cafe was lively and surprisingly busy for 3-ish on a thursday afternoon. it was spacious with tall ceilings and long tables, square tables, round tables, and lounge tables galore.  the coffee itself, excellent. i'm no coffee conniseuer, and i have no idea if the coffee bean came from a single batch, from the andes and roasted in some 1000 year old roaster handed down from a grandma. however, i do know that i got the mexican mocha with  cayenne and that ish was the ish.  i also know that the cappuccino my brother in law ordered was strong and robust. and lastly, i strongly have an inkling that the barista's behind the bar know what they are doing with the coffees that are being served here at dollop coffee shop. some come here and enjoy yourself some goodness and get yourself out of the cold!a fine place to work; passable coffee, decent bagel sandwiches.  mostly high-top bar stools, but there are a few armchairs.  music was faintly jarring, but not seriously objectionable.i rain into an unusually contentious bunch of customers --- one couple sniping at each other about who was going to take care of the dog, another pair cursing loudly about doors that open inwards instead of outwards (which apparently breaks the flow of walking out with your coffee).  perhaps more people here should order the decaf...i come here at least once every few weeks to study. good place to get some work done or for a meeting but a few things can be done better. the work vibe is very nice, a good level of ambient noise nice big windows with a lot of lighting. some good armchairs, couches, window bar seats and some tables of varying sizes. there is good table space for a laptop or smt but some of the the tables are pretty small/can get crowded/weirdly shaped so its hard to have a lot of work space. if you come on a weekend i would suggest getting here before 11am or after 3pm as sometimes it can be quite busy and have no seating. and bring a jacket if you're going to be here for a bit... it always feels cold whether its summer or winter. coffee/expresso- rich and dark chai latte- if you like a good strong chai flavored latte, i would recommended. they make all their lattes with pretty designs! there is also always a self serve water station so you can stay hydrated! food: had the brie sandwich here before but it was quite pricey and there's doesnt seem to be an actual kitchen that makes food. the baked goods like muffins etc are ok. i think it would be a lot better if there would be more food options here. i'd say if you're in the area give this place a shot to do some work, read a book, or enjoy a nice conversation but i would not come here hungry (or cold).coffee is pretty good. i had a cappuccino and it had a smooth, buttery mouthfeel. they clearly use a blond roast, which is not my favorite for a cappuccino. but anyway, that's not the larger issue that resulted in my 3 stars.i'm deducting two stars because the seating is, i'm not kidding, horrible. they have this long bar along the window with stools. the seats are made from a 2x12 piece of lumber. square cut. flat. literally the least human-friendly shape a seat could take without involving pyramids. no matter how i put my feet up on the footrests, the corners of the seat dig into my thighs.so i move to the shorter chairs placed around the lower tables. they're better. but now my knees are up around my chin. and that exposes the bony part of my rump so that's uncomfortable after five mins.the staff -- disinterested in anything but their interpersonal relationships. not a very friendly place.this is a really cute coffee shop! great place to hang out or work during the day, with bright lights, open seating, and a few comfy armchairs and couches. i ordered the honey cinnamon latte less sweet which was delicious and had a beautiful design as well! other reviews said the latte was sweet and typically i enjoy my coffee on the bitter side, so the less sweet option was perfect. with that i had the build your own bagel meal, which i also quite enjoyed and thought it was a good price for how much food you got, and you could choose from a really good variety of bagels, spreads, and toppings! would definitely recommend to anyone in the area!great place for coffee and tea!  forget that chain that starts with a s and come here instead.  service was great and employees were friendly and knowledgeable.  my only lost star was just because i didn't really care for the flavor of the chai tea latte.  it was a little too heavy on one flavor, probably cinnamon.  but, other than that, great!  free wifi and nice, comfortable couches.good looking coffee shop, nice place to chill in for a morning. but the staff are entirely unfriendly, overwhelmed and aloof. they forget orders, leave your breakfast in the toaster to take time to count they're tip jar. management should be made aware.chomping on a vegan banana nut muffin as i type and i can't believe it's not butter!  yes there are more coffee-nazi places out there, but this place strikes a great balance between getting some work done and staying refreshed throughout the day.  thus, the coveted 5-star rating!steve's digialnomad rating == 4/4fast wifi/cell reception - yepfood/snacks - yespower - fo shoplace to chill - alwaysthe mexican mocha is my favorite here. it's not too sweet but sweet enough for my sweet tooth. i also liked their vanilla latte and chai latte. i would definitely come back!good coffee, quick eats, free wifi, tons of tables. pricier than your average but the lattes are made in front of you and the hot chocolate is cocoa strong. free wifi and water make it an ideal spot to get some work done for an hour or two. not the comfiest of seats but definitely one of the better options for a morning break in the area.pretty cool modern / trendy coffee shop in the heart of streeterville that seems to always be busy. free wifi and plenty of seats but somehow always difficult to find somewhere to grab a spot as just about everyone in here seems to be trying to get some work done.aside from that, definitely a go to spot to grab a cup of joe if i don't feel like making coffee at home. they serve up all the classics from your standard cup of coffee to americanos to lattes and cappuccinos, and even some specialties as i've read some have raved about their nutella mocha. as i recall they serve strictly metropolis coffee which is a local chicago based coffee company. pretty cool they keep it local and they even carry their whole bean coffee in bags if you'd like to take some for home. in addition, they also serve some assorted baked good and some assorted breakfast and lunch sandwiches if you get hungry. anyways for the same price as as the big chain coffee shops, why not keep it local? other than that not much else i got on this one. 'til next time, cheers!    140/365i love this shop! they're conveniently located in streeterville and always make everything perfectly to order. my go-to is always the mocha and their designs on the coffee are so well done. everyone's so friendly there- special shout out to sam! definitely not a coffee shop you would feel uncomfortable in! highly recommend if you're in the area.excellent dedication to satisfying customers. great pastries for breakfast. nice atmosphere.this place is great. has that local coffee vibe and has some really good coffee. my favorite is the honey cinnamon latte. comes in hot or iced, both are delicious. slightly pricey ($5.05 for the iced latte seems a dollar high than i'd like to pay).good coffee, plenty of seating, wifi, convenient-ish stop for something warm to drink when walking east to navy pier. baristas were super friendly and accommodating. we decided to change our order (doh!) and they were very gracious about it. the usual coffee/tea drinks and the honey cinnamon latte was a fav.i always liked this place until today. i ordered an ice mocha and asked a giant ice cube to be removed from the cup. the guy used his hand to grab that ice cube and his fingers all dipped in my coffee. he didn't even say sorry. anyhow he couldn't grab that ice using his fingers after several trys so he poured the coffee to another cup with less ice. then again dipped his fingers to that new cup to grab ice! at least be professional and wear the gloves! so gross!love! this coffee shop is totally adorable and makes a great latte. they have alternate milk options, which is essential to me. we continually go back and highly recommend it! (:man i wish i lived in chicago just so i can study here!!! this is seriously the cutest most hip little coffee shop. the decor is very modern and chic. all the baristas are so cool looking and complement the vibe. i read the reviews on yelp before hand and a lot of people talked about the mexican coffee and since that sounded uber duber awesome, i got that. omg seriously if it started snowing right now outside, and i had my mexican coffee, i would be a happy girl. the coffee has such a feisty kick when you drink it due to the cayenne pepper and it makes your whole body warm. it's such a rich and unique depth of overwhelming flavor, definitely a must try!!the patrons all look like younger aged population in the 20s and many were hard at work. i think this would be an invigorating location to get work done and enjoy food and drinks. loved it!i spent the guts of three days working out of this coffee shop while visiting chicago - it was the third coffee shop i landed at over the course of the trip, and i'm really glad i found it!coffee: greatservice: fantastic (friendly baristas noticed i was effectively living there by day 2)wifi: good - they've got a comcast line, works well enough.i had pre ordered my drink through the ritual app. when i got there i picked up a drink that was by the counter and took a hearty sip. i quickly realized that it was not the almond latte had ordered. luckily it was my best friend's mexican mocha. my almond milk latte was prepared and i reluctantly  had to give the mexican mocha back to her. both drinks were very tasty, but i highly recommend the specialty lattes. they're very balanced and not too sweet!great coffee spot in downtown! we went here today after spending the afternoon at the navy pier. the baristas were friendly and efficient. plenty of seating and great drinks! my boyfriend tried a guatemalan pour over called santa sofia and i ordered the mexican mocha (it's made with a three chile blend). both drinks came out quickly and were very flavorful. given our experience i would definitely come back to try more!i recently discovered dollop and it's now my favorite coffee shop in chicago. bright sunny space, a really great cup of coffee and the staff is the absolute best.  i'm so glad i found this place!they make an excellent mexican mocha - rich, spicy, not too sweet, and flavorful. very impressed! the space is big, bright, and open with plenty of seating and wide aisles - it's accessible and good for folks with strollers or wheelchairs. they were playing fun 90s/2000s music and the staff was friendly and efficient.was so happy to have some warming welcoming experience. the two guys were very sweet and attentive. i am enjoying this type of vive. that's what keeps customers coming back. attentiveness and a smile go a long way. kudos to this mornings staff.it is a very nice place for a coffee on winter. the coffee is really good, however there were only two options. the tea option are great for those who don't like any kind of coffee...stopped in for a bit for a cup of coffee after a long walk. cool atmosphere for a quick drink but don't know that i'd like to sit for a long extended period to get work done.the interior is a little stark and the seating is hard and uncomfortable. the staff was  friendly and helpful. i got a mocha which was pretty good. nice place for a quick drink and you get 10% off every order if you work or live in the area.honey cinnamon latter good and not too sweet. can be hotter in temp.  nice space with lots of working space.place is legit. i am moving to a place about 2 blocks away and i envision this being a crack like habit. not the cheap imported crack, but that good small craft batch crack cooked over a bunson burner. tried a regular mocha and the nutella mocha, both amazing. i recco the nutella mocha since it's not something you see everywhere. the place is always packed, morning or afternoon. lots of laptops and headphones but a good vibe with great people.this is the coolest coffee shop ever! i could listen to their hip hop playlist all day and sip on my mexican mocha. there's lots of tables and window-bar seating and comfy couch seating, and there seems to be a lot of people working remotely from there. i'm not sure how they are able to get much done with the background noise but power to them.extra hot mexican mocha with sticky foam! looks too beautiful to sip! i finally destroyed the baristas masterpiece and it tastes amazing! the cinnamon chili spice complements the smooth dark chocolate and warm milk perfectly decor is cute, 70s glam mod with a little country kitchen thrown in for comfort. patrons here appear to be creatively working on their macs, i'm trying to fit in by writing this review!cool place to visit if you are in the neighborhood!great cafe to work from.  not too slammed or loud, really good bagel sandwiches (i got the turkey), and the honey cinnamon latte thing is very tasty.cute coffee place. we enjoyed the honey cinnamon latte and the mexican cocoa. wifi was good. saw a lot of people working or studying here. i like that the bathroom is labeled "whichever." fine service.great place to work/study, super friendly staff, and a ton of outlets + different seating options. consider ordering the cinnamon honey latte, super tasty!i love love love studying here. the music is on point, it's never too crowded, & even if it is there are enough seats. not to mention the free wifi. i've also gone to dollop on van buren in the loop but this location has so far been my favorite. i've gotten the smores mocha, nutella mocha, & veggie breakfast sandwich and have yet to be disappointed!had a cortado. coffee was too sour and strong.  will try again for a better cup of coffee.i used to love this place but in the last few months they've been blasting the music way too loud lately to the point that its unbareablegreat writing/working space, atmosphere and drinks. baristas are friendly too!while in town on vacation i was looking for a space to write. this place appealed to me for the variety of seating arrangements, natural light and free wifi. they have a nice long bar with stools to either stand or sit at. i like having both options to keep the writing going! they have extension cords around the place so plenty of outlets to plug into if you have a long enough leash... i mean cord ;)i also love their range of music. i have heard both alt-j and the beach boys while here. the volume is just enough to enjoy but not overpowering your focus.i ordered an iced vanilla latte. they have a range of sweeteners for self-service, which i usually will do to avoid over sugary drinks. however they put in just the right amount for me. the espresso is very good. deep and smooth, and not too acidic. next time, i'll bring a snack (or try a scone here) and try their mexican mocha.i love this place for a quick sandwich and to do some work on my laptop during my lunch break, but the past 10-15 times i have been here, they have been out of ingredients for the turkey sandwich. they run out of baguettes so frequently, a few weeks ago they ran out of turkey, today they didn't have cheese, and once or twice they have run out of avocado. i go to lunch between 12 and 1, so i am surprised that by this time they are still running out of ingredients. the coffee is good and when all ingredients are on the sandwiches, they are delicious! i like the ambiance, but because of these ingredient shortages, i'm definitely going to be frequenting less.ordered a pour over coffee and have to say that it was pretty bad.  while the barrista seemed to prepare it properly by weighing, timing the delivery of water, etc the end result was a coffee that was under extracted and very watery in taste.  i thought that maybe it was the bean and/or roast but ultimately it didn't matter.  the drink was not good.  i returned it and explained my dislike.  they happily gave me a brewed coffee instead which tasted much better.still one of my favorite stops to get something to drink. the ambience is chill; there isn't loud music or tons of chit-chatting. the baristas behind the bar are very friendly, and the drinks are always amazing. this location is also down the street from one of my favorite restaurants, so i'm not sure why i don't frequent this place as often....amazing almond milk latte and very friendly baristasflavor & prep of latté is 5 star. but if you want eats, go elsewhere. we had a muffin but they could not warm it up. also a big pet peeve of mine is defaulting to a paper cup.  but she did manage to get us a nice latte art.really cute,  friendly staff,  lots of room to work if need be.  great atmosphere,  coffee and pastry selection is great!ordered the raspberry mocha, mexican mocha, and the turkey sandwich.the raspberry mocha was rich, creamy, flavorful, and had that nice raspberry flavor that made you want to drink it more and more. it wasn't too heavy and served as a great morning starter. great choice if you want a change from your regular mocha.the mexican mocha was definitely more flavorful due to the dash of cayenne that warms your soul as you drink it. the consistency was thicker and creamier. this is the perfect drink for a cold chicago day! the turkey sandwich was also very delicious! the avocado and chipotle mayo paired perfectly with the toasty whole grain bread. everything was very fresh and made my morning fantastic!will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu! there is also also of table space to get work done as well as outlets and wifi!what a great coffee place. i love the amount of natural lighting it gets. the coffee is tasty and their pastry delicious, but the best is their friendly and outstanding service!if you are looking for a quality cup of coffee, this is the place to go. amazing beans and baristas. also, the turkey sandwich with avocado on a fresh baguette was awesome too.dollop is a cool coffee joint near the magnificent mile. they have the usual coffee selections and plus some unique special ones written on a small list located next to the register. the shop is very spacious with lots of seats, tables, and even a couch and sofas. this shop would make an excellent study center. i had the mexican mocha with cayenne, mexican cocoa, and lavender vanilla latte. both mexican drinks had spicy cayenne pepper that is pretty noticeable but not too spicy to be offensive. the spiciness lingers on for minutes even if you stopped after a small sip. the lavender vanilla latte was pretty good but nothing outstanding. i especially love the creamy taste of it. all the drinks had a fair amount of sweetness which is just right for me. price for the drinks was about 5 bux after tax for a large size, which appears to be 20 ounces, which is fair.the environment is minimalistic and trendy. it reminds me of the apple store with the wooden chairs, wooden tables, and clean design. overall coffee 4 stars and environment 5 stars.best. coffee. in. chicago.i love love love the lattes and regular house coffee here.the food also looks awesome! they sell sandwiches and cool lunch foods.the seating area is great too! lots of people come here to study!i recently bought coffee beans from this place to make the coffee at home with my french press and it is absolutely heaven in a cup! definitely buy their coffee beans if you have a coffee machine/maker at home! it is totally worth it:)so cute! they put cute designs in coffee, the space is cute, the coffee flavors are cute. i love it, obviously better than starbucks.was in town from san francisco for the niners and bears and needed some caffeine for the 12p kick. headed here, cause it was the closest cafe to our hotel and did not second guess ourselves! my wife is a big fan of mexican mocha's in the bay area. and to her surprise she found dollop's also offered their version. she said it was as good as from the coffee shop she orders from in sf, antiguas. my coffee was on point as well and would head back over and over and over again! keep it going and we'll see you the next time were in the windy city.cute little coffee shop in downtown chicago. away from all the noise, traffic, and tourists. you definitely get a "get work done" vibe as soon as you walk in. most people are on their laptops working, very little conversations happening. great to sit and read a book!the baristas make an awesome soy chai latte. i tend to order i coffee or chai while on the train so by the time i get to my train stop i am able to just pickup and go.after dinner at bombay wraps across the road, i suggested post-meal coffee fix to my hubby.  i knew dollop coffee & tea was in a close proximity, and they open until 2100 hour, unlike many downtown coffee shops that would close at 1800 hour or open no later than 2000 hour.  i walked in, quickly browsed through the menu, and found my target of interest!  "awesome, they have mexican mocha with cayenne."  i always love the "ipsento" at ipsento in bucktown by the cta western blue line station (o'hare branch).  cayenne pepper is the key ingredient in a cup of "ipsento."  thus, i was excited to see it on the menu here at dollop.  dollop coffee & tea uses metropolis coffee, one of my favorite local coffee brands (other than dark matter).  they have a high-ceiling dining room, with a plenty of chairs, high stools, and power outlets.  my plan was to take it to-go, yet i changed my mind since the ambiance appeared to be relaxing to stick around and watch some sophisticated downtown-dwellers passing back and forth.  my mexican mocha was delicious, but the cayenne pepper was a bit too strong to my liking.  perhaps my taste bud was somewhat skewed since i had some indian food with distinct spices used in the food i just consumed.  nevertheless, i was very glad i could end my work day with a cup of quality coffee.i remember my last visit to a dollop coffee & tea (lakeview location) wasn't as spectacular, but i think i've had a better experience with this streeterville location this evening.  as always, i'm a die-hard supporter of local businesses, and i will certainly advocate dollop coffee & tea to anyone who wants "coffee," not diluted, mysterious brown h2o like you see at a place with an initial "dd."we had a quick weekend away & were staying close by, we ended up at dollop two evenings in a row and both times we were the only customers. which, i enjoyed! although it seems to be much busier in the morning and close to lunch time.the space was trendy & a bit industrial and the staff was very friendly, which was a huge plus. nothing worse than coffee snobs! :)my husband ordered hot chocolate and absolutely loved it. i had a mexican mocha- it definitely had quite the kick to it going down the throat, not really my style. i also tried a vanilla lavender latte, i believe is what it was called, and it didn't have too much flavor. i was hoping to really taste those notes of vanilla & lavender. all in all, i would go back and try something new. good vibes.i love dollop! their drinks are great. i had the nutella mocha which was perfectly balanced and not too sweet. definitely worth a try. dollop is one of my favorite places in river north to do work! the ambiance is a perfect combination of hipster and modern. they have ample outlets and lots of table space.this place is lit. extremely good wi-fi (tested on the howfastwifi app, you can stream stuff here too, no lag. the place is very spacious and clean. coffee is good, staff is friendly, and they have a bathroom. its a step down from hipster, but just a step away. **music is amazing here, best of like 90's and 2000s. waiting for the backstreet boys to come up.**i'm addicted to their nutella mocha. it's so delicious, smooth and perfect temperature. i'm a big fan of strong espresso drinks but after trying this, uuuummmmm! love this smooth taste.it's a big coffee shop located in the heart of streeterville area. very modern and artsy. definitely, a great spot to bring your device here and chill or it's a great spot to meet up with friends and talk non-stop( but make sure you won't be late for work like me yesterday, lol) always fun to go there. convenience location for me. downstairs from a luxury apartment, atwater( i hang out there all the time) cool restaurants, movie theater and super markets around. walking distance to michigan ave. and shopping center. love it here :)in town for a few days and this was close to my hotel. my cappuccino was good and i really liked the chocolate chip scone. moderate prices and a clean atmosphere. not super cozy, more modernthis place not only has a super hip and fun atmosphere but the coffee is so amazing. i almost gave it a four based on the prices, but i guess it is worth the price.stopped by here to get a drink after eating at m burger. very spacious coffee place. exceptionally high ceiling with lots of sunlight from the glass windows.the lavender vanilla latte is amazing! not too sweet with the vanilla. the lavender is subtle but noticeable enough - awesome drink. house coffee is great, fresh, bold, and full bodied. one thing i find interesting is that there is only one restroom for the entire store, which is quite large in size, compared to the coffee shops i've visited. i mean one for both genders. and the condition is not pleasing at all. anyway, the drinks we've ordered are good and atmosphere is nice. we'll come again if we happen to be in this area next time.spacious, bright, floor-to-ceiling windows. the iced tea is light but refreshing for a hot summers day. bagel with spread yummy but a little bit hard. spent all afternoon studying here and love the atmosphere.delicious drinks after a long wait. if you are coming here to just hand out, it may be a while until a table becomes available.i stop by every chance i get! my favorite is their iced hazelnut latte. this is a great spot to catch up with friends, or even sit on their couch all day and surf the internet. i'm a huge fan of dollop.atmosphere - 4/5the ambiance is good if you are looking for somewhere to study. if you want to hangout with some friends, this might not be the place because around 90% of customers that stay to sit down bring study materials and spend a long time here.the coffee - 3/5the coffee is decent. if you are coming to study and not looking for excellent coffee, this is the place for you. if you are a huge coffee fan, i don't know if i would recommend dollop cafe. there are other places you can find better coffee.i got the iced americano and it was very watered down and did not have much depth of flavor, in my opinion.customer service - 2.5/5the customer service wasn't great. the workers aren't necessarily rude. rather, they were unpleasant because they seemed annoyed at any request or questions asked. first, they got my order wrong and when i pointed it out, the barista made it seem like she was doing me a favor by remaking my drink. i would say the lack of customer service is the reason i give 3 stars overall.overall, if you are looking for a cute place to study with decent coffee, i would recommend dollop. the large glass windows allow for good lighting and atmosphere overall and you will most likely be surrounded by people also studying. i would not recommend for people looking for a place to hangout/chat or for really good coffee.nice place to bring laptop, sit and work on stuffs. quite spacious interior with many seats. great ambience. many coffee and tea options.downside is, since this place is awesome, there's always full of people whenever i went. hard to find seat sometimes.hipster staff, mixed customer mecca. i live just upstairs next door at 355 e so this is convenient to pick up metropolis beans, which they also brew. i'm usually a medium cup of coffee, skip the frou-frou drinks kind of fella. their coffee is good if small for the $2.15 medium price. i've tried the cappuccino and it's wonderful. they have some very interesting specialty drinks both on the regular menu and a special rotating menu just in front of the registers. have not tried their pastries or sandwiches but they look tasty and fresh. curiously absent from a *coffee* place are breakfast sandwiches or fare in general. i mentioned this to an employee once and he said, "well that's more for a place where people hang out for awhile." i didn't have the heart to raise my brow sitcom style and turn dramatically to look at the **fully seated** chairs and tables of people doing exactly that, plonking on their devices, reading a paper, etc. for said devices is free wifi, which should be de rigueur these days!browsed yelp to find a new coffee place in the city and found this one. went on a late sunday afternoon and the place was packed with students using their laptops. had a spicy mocha and it was very good. the only negative thing was there were no pastries left so the people in our group that didn't want coffee got nothing. will try again, however maybe a different location as this one is too far off michigan avenue.a little "dollop" of happiness here. one of the things i do when i come to chi-town is get coffee--it's a must. necessity laid upon me and i found myself here. those of you who have been to a "dean & deluca" in nyc will find yourself in a similarly decor-ed place. very simple, yet trendy. many people here on a sunday are working/studying.i ordered the "toasted marshmallow latte." yes and yes. i really could taste the marshmallow and not just a bunch of sugar. my hubby got the same thing, only iced, and it was equally as good. this wasn't my first time at this "rodeo" as i've gotten the iced "lavender vanilla latte" before. there are more "dollop" locations around chi-town. but i prefer this one as it's a bit on the larger size and feels more open.you guys. best. coffee. i've. ever. had. totally contemplating moving to chicago to be closer to dollop. srsly.i had an americano every day i was in town with just a dollop of creamer because the espresso tasted so good. my friend had a mexican mocha which was pleasantly spicy and made with discernibly high quality chocolate.awesome coffee and great service!on such a cool day walking to the navy pier this was yummy! perfect cafe on the corner.coffee is usually quite good depending on what they are serving that day. espresso is rich and full, and they pull a great shot. the atmosphere is great. i go here several times a week as it is near work. music is generally adventurous but not overbearing. right now they are pkaying some down tempo hip-hop funk. i use this as a meeting place for 'getting to know you' inquiries and casual business.great coffee, with excellent nyc-style bagels and pastries available. great for a fast grab-and-go breakfast.really cool environment and awesome atmosphere at dollop. although they have other locations around the city, i'm partial to this location. great place to chill and catch up on some emails or study. every time i come in it has been crowded. that's because the coffee is sooo good!  lots of flavor packed into these drinks with some really great pastries and cookies to pair with a great mocha.friendly service, fantastic coffee, excellent baked goods. a great little neighborhood spot for either a caffeine fix or to knock out an hour or two of work away from the office!highly recommend the mexican chile mocha and the honey cinnamon latte. yum!love the high sealing in this place, good place to work or be creative. the coffee is excellent, and there is a wide array of cold an warm beverages as well as pastries to choose from.this was terrible. although the decor was nice, the beverages were underwhelming. the coffee was sour, the hot chocolate was cold (ironically) and the latte art was nice on the coffees but not the hot chocolate. would not recommend. at all.very cute. extremely good place to study but noisy. tried the honey cinnamon latte. not very sweet but not very strong just ok but they do leave a cute design in milk on top :) boyfriend had macchiato. it was perfect! strong and yummymy go to coffee place when i'm in the streeterville area. good/stable wifi, nice selection of coffee, tea, and specialty drinks (actually, they have a pretty extensive specialty drink menu), and people here come to get work done. with this being said, you can expect some quiet time here minus the once-in-a-while large group that grabs drinks and leave shortly after. there are plugs galore, so you can stay here for as long as you please. baristas are not too overly friendly, but they do their best to provide you with quality drinks and service.come here if you want to get work done in a semi-quiet environment and appreciate nice interior design to go along with your coffee/work experience.coffee is very good but the croissant is just as bad as those in starbucks, not fresh, not crunchy.cute place great options i had the mexican latte it was perfect, not too hot to totally kill my taste buds, perfect to drink right away, plenty of seating, decent music, they played the yeah yeah yeahs when i was in there  i'll be backthis is the place to go for a good latte in river east!i rarely found myself in this area early enough for coffee, but went here nearly every day while attending a conference within walking distance for a week based on a recommendation from a fellow coffee lover and soooo glad i did!they have lots of "fancy drink" options, my favorite of the ones i tried being the mexican mocha.  just the right amount of cayenne to give it a little kick without being overwhelming.  they take their coffee seriously and can be a bit of a wait involved during the morning rush, so give yourself time.i also tried a few different croissant options - almond, raspberry goat cheese, and plain.  the raspberry goat cheese was a different combo from your usual filled croissant.  a good sweet and savory mix.dollop has a great space to enjoy a drink and danish or sandwich if you're looking for a place to linger and study or work.  a little hipster, a little pretentious feel to it at first, but the baristas are actually really friendly, welcoming and inviting.  ask all your questions away and they will help to direct you to the right choice for your preferences without making you feel out of place!i have a love and hate relationship with this location. i love the food and drinks and service but i absolutely hate the clientele and how dirty the bathroom gets. i'm absolutely in love with their ham and cheese croissants and jam biscuits. i don't even care that i turn into the queen of crumbs while eating it. the berry iced tea is my go to drink here but i hear that the nutella mocha is amazing. there's a couple of outlets for the working bunch that frequents this place but they're kind of oddly placed. the four or so couch seats can't reach (only two to three seats in that area can reach the outlet that has room for seven devices to be plugged in.the people who are under the mistaken notion that they're in their own living room so they take their shoes off and place their feet on the couches and proceed to speak loudly- disgust me. this is still a place of business, one that serves food and drinks no less. nobody wants to see your gross feet on the couch near their food. i have no idea why people are complaining about the servers here. they aren't little rays of sunshine all the time but no one is after being hassled to make ridiculous drink concoctions for people who are equally no rays of sunshine. they've always been polite and delivered what i ordered. as long as they serve the berry iced tea i'll be back. it's delicious!refined, yet not pretentious. this was my first thought when i came into this coffee joint. the mexican mocha provides a touch of spice, but doesn't overwhelm. my friend ordered the nutella mocha and said the same, a hint of nutella, but not like you are drinking a cup of the stuff.love dollop! great neighborhood spot to grab coffee or a light bite. prepare for a line most weekend mornings, but always worth it. i would suggest the chai or a cappuccino- they make the prettiest coffee art here as well. get one of their pour overs if you need some serious caffeine- you will be awake for days!i love the modern vibe of this place from the music to the space. it's a great place to study or people watch. not a cosy coffee shop so if that's the vibe you want try somewhere else. really good iced chai, but was not impressed with their baked goods.a little disappointed from my most recent trip here. ordered a slice of pie which, when it was cut and served, was practically a small mound of mush... i would have at least hoped for a slightly larger mound of mush... but something more resembling a pie slice would have been preferred.i don't think i'll be coming back here for slices of pie -  but rather go straight to hoosier mama since i bet they treat their pies right!dollop made for a great location for a coffee date that i recently went on.  they have a sofa and a few armchairs that were perfect to relax in, drink coffee, and chat.  the coffee was bold and flavorful, i had some fun banter with the ladies working behind the counter, and the shop itself has a great overall design.  dollop is a very easy recommendation.i don't understand the rave reviews. it is a cute/modern atmosphere and i'd be down to meet a friend or study here (which is why i gave it two stars) but the two times i've been here i thought the coffee was below average. today i got a regular drip coffee and it tastes like it's been sitting for awhile and it's just not good. the other time i ordered a dirty chai latte and again was underwhelmed. i really wish this place was better since it's close to me. i'm not sure if i'll be back.awesome bagel sandwiches, coffee and service!  i am not based in chicago but had unfortunately left one of my favorite scarves.  however, the staff were incredibly friendly when i called back to see if it was still there.  they had my scarf and even shipped it back to me!stopped in here for some mid afternoon coffee. i just have to say how struck i was with how friendly the barista was. you won't find that at starbucks or dd. not much to say besides free wifi, great local college student scene, excellent capp. skip starbucks and stop in here instead. you won't be disappointed. they also had a nice selection of fresh brewed teas.i'm a big fan of intelligentsia and this is one of my favorite locations of theirs. tucked into a historical chicago building it has awesome old timely ambiance. that is until you go to order and are met with all the latest trends in artisan coffee. they certainly don't disappoint with their beverages. a beautifully crafted coffee, an oat milk chai, iced tea, and other treats. you can't go wrong.anytime i come to chicago, usually a stop to an intelligentsia happens. while it is one of the larger 3rd wave coffee chains, i still find they produce a great cup of coffee and are consistent. stopped here for a quick cup to go and was not disappointed. they have a two pour over options and only one brewed ahead of time. good variety of beans, ethiopian, el salvador, and a kenya.excellent coffee, good atmosphere. quality food.. what more does one want before they start the day:)will be back. thanks for great servicewas in chicago for a conference and went to intelligista in the mornings for a coffee and pastry (3 visits).  i've been to other outlets mainly in los angeles and intelligista is one of my favorite specialty coffee chains.my rating is based on the following: coffee: 4.5 starscoffee beans: 3.5 starsservice and atmosphere: 5 starsfood: 4 starsi tried the chocolate croissant as well as the ham and cheese pastry. of the two i would recommend the ham and cheese pastry. i am a black coffee drinker and had the pour over with what ever beans they were brewing on hand that day.  during that time period it was mainly beans from the south american region. i prefer african beans with more acidity and fruit flavor to the smooth and nuttiness of a columbian coffee. coffee as in other locations was good and the staff is friendly and helpful with recommendations. given i purchased beans both the peru and persephone blend.  can't really recommend these beans. they aren't bad per say but nothing special and was a bit disappointed when i started using these at home.great latte. they don't have the super comfortable furniture probably to keep folks from sitting there all day. it's clean and in a good part of town. i would definitely make it a meeting spot if i were more local.stopped by after coming in on the train, looking for some yummy coffee to warm me up. this place delivered! the art on my mocha was beautiful and the mocha tasted delicious! the taste is a perfect balance between chocolate and coffee!tldr: was great for a quick coffee._______waiting for breakfast a block away dropped in here for a coffee while i waitedi'm basic, so i always go with a vanilla latte. i actually forgot to add vanilla to it and they were kind enough to add it later and didn't up charge me. super cool of them. i think they make the vanilla in house - it was a super good and well done latte.nice wooden shelves (bar) with wooden stools. cool decor. they had really cool art . the posters were like a maze where you have a start and finish and also snapshots of famous sites around town.i think the staff are really nice and knowledgeable. that brought me from a 3 star to 4 star experience. i had the la tortuga, which was smooth and not too acidic. almost a hint of chocolate taste? i could be totally wrong, but it's what i personally taste. was it phenomenal? not really... would i come back? maybe if i was in the area and needed a casual coffee fix. it's a chic place with a nice ambiance.we came here because we had time to burn before halal guys opened for lunch a couple blocks away and i'm glad we picked up coffee at intelligentsia. my vanilla latte was perfect--no complaints. baristas here know their stuff! the interior is also really cool--a lot of people chilling here with laptops or reading books. only downside is that it's expensive! but...it is truly well-executed coffee..very good coffee but the barista take his job very seriously leading to long waits for your drinkthis matcha latte was $8 (& some change) :( yes i get it, it was probably good quality matcha and they encouraged me to try it with oat milk but i just cannot justify $8 for a small portion of matcha. i would prefer an extra large steaming hot cup that i can sip on for an extended period of time, not this shooter glass. also because of this price i was discouraged to get a pastry and to be completely honest i walked straight into dunkin' next door after this and got my usual wake up wrap and iced coffee because i felt so unfulfilled. got a good insta story tho!got the cold brew. it was good, but not great.i am nitpicky with my cold brew. for me, it needs to be smooth without much acidity while having nutty caramel notes.the acidity of the cold brew left an unsatisfying aftertaste in my mouth.  the coffee just needed some more milk before i could enjoy it. if cold brew require's milk to ease the acid, then cold brew is not the best imo.consistently great coffee at all intelligentsia coffee cafe!rich, intense, aromatic and smooth flat white. just the right balance of milk and coffee. their barristers never failed to make my day with their coffees! beautiful in execution, balance and presentation.great place to get a coffee and snacks. i was super curious about the name. i had a butter croissant, havana cold brew and chai mata latte. i loved taking a little break from exploring the city. the coffee was good and was much needed. stop by if you see one :)i was visiting chicago for work and decided to try this place out on saturday morning. i heard they have a geisha coffee, which is rare to find, so i walked the two miles from my hotel to try it out, only for the barista to tell his manager that he doesn't feel like making it.  there was no explanation as to why he didn't want to do it, and there wasn't a line, as i know that pour overs can be a time consuming process. they fumbled to make an alternative suggestion, but i simply left in frustration.  plus one star for the unsuccessful attempt.i got the tea which tasted great but over all there weren't many options and it seemed a bit over priced. it's cute, but it's not much.if you are looking for good coffee but willing to pay a pretty penny for it, come here. the menu offers your staples and some more adventurous drinks. the only milk alternative available is oat milk, first i was scared but actually was pleasantly surprised. there's an assortment of treats and pastries that taste as good as they look. overall this place feels as smart as the name makes it sound.i absolutely love their limelight! it is a seasonal drink, but boy does it have a nice tangy kick to it! never knew coffee and lemon could be a great combination. the cafe is small and inviting. noticeably great for work/studying as it was quiet and had several tables. will be back for my limelight when i'm in the area!i think intellegentsia is the best coffee in the world. the spaces are always so cool and the baristas are beyond knowledgeable. this location is no different! the cool vibe inside matched the baristas. it may seem a little expensive but in my opinion its totally worth it. once you try the vanilla latte, it'll be hard to go elsewhere....i was so impressed with this coffee joint. my friend and i came here while waiting to be seated for brunch close by, and i wanted a coffee. there was a fairly long line when we got in, and the store itself isn't too big so there's not much moving room. my usual order is a vanilla soy latte, but the cashier recommended me oat milk so i decided to try that instead. their coffee is so good. i could definitely tell the difference in quality and the vanilla added the right amount of sweetness. my friend got a hot tea which came in a mini pot and a bowl to pour it in. it was so cute!the only negative thing was that my coffee came out to $6 which is quite steep, but i didn't mind too much since i was on vacation. i don't know about spending that much on coffee on a regular basis though.solid coffee shop with a cool vibe. open space with room for studying or reading--it probably seats around 25 people. outside seating is available. overall good experience. the coffee itself was pretty good--they roast their own beans which is always a plus, considering they have control over their flavors. the only reason i gave it four stars is because i've had better coffee from other roasteries. with that being said, if you're just looking for a good cup of coffee, this will be a good experience.it has become tradition for me to visit an independent coffee shop in any city i travel to. i'm a big fan of chemex/pour-over coffee, and i absolutely love third-wave coffee roasters and independent coffeeshops. i've had all the "big three of third wave coffee" coffees - stumptown, intelligentsia, and counter culture - but this was my first time visiting a standalone intelligentsia coffee shop.this intelligentsia was only a mere block from millennium park, so it was very conveniently located. i like the industrial feel which didn't diminish the coziness of the shop. there's a large coffee bar, behind which the baristas work their magic. there's a handful of seats available, but it can definitely fill up quick. if you are a fan of chemex, v60, siphon, and cafe solo, you will be satisfied with intelligentsia's offerings. they also have espresso, cold brew iced coffee, chai, loose leaf tea, iced tea, matcha latte, and hot chocolate. i had their chemex and their matcha latte, and both were fantastic. the baristas take great care in crafting the perfect cup for you. i like that for chemex, they'll give you a cup of the brewed coffee and an additional decanter of extra coffee on a wooden tray. free wifi too!ordered a mocha "for here" and it came in a great big cup, had some fun latte art, and was just the right amount of chocolate and coffee. since visiting chicago, my palate has definitely changed and i am not in desperate need for there to be a sweet component to my coffee anymore. with that said, the bittersweet of this mocha hit the spot, and anyone who may want to hit that chocolate and coffee fix in one go, this is the way to do it.the coffee shop has bar seating as well as lower sitting tables to meet a variety of needs, whether you just need a place to stand or if you're wanting to spend the afternoon there.i was in need of a good cup of coffee. i knew intelligentsia was the place i wanted to go. quiet little place. only a few people with their laptops out.. a few tables of friends catching up.. ya know like how grabbing coffee used to be. countertop areas for the solo coffee connoisseur.. light pastries to accompany your coffee or tea.. brightly lit. as for the explanation of the type of coffee used in my latte... it didn't happen.. only reason for the 4 star review.intelligentsia! i've finally made it! i first heard about intelligentsia while watching the documentary "barista". i immediately knew that this was one of *the* places to go if you want legit coffee from legit baristas (i'm sorry starbucks, i promise i'll return to basic once i get back home!). the black cat cappuccino was absolutely divine! perfect ratio of espresso, milk, and foam and beautiful presentation. i also tried just the black cat espresso and it was smoooooth! this location is a short walk from millennium park and the baristas were very professional and friendly. seating is limited and the place can get pretty packed during peak hours, but don't let that deter you from trying chicago's best coffee!this place is the worst. one of their employees is pissed off all the time, refuses to make eye contact or be pleasant, and literally scowls at patrons. how does someone like this remain employed? additionally, everything takes forever and a day. and the drinks are gross. the cream is subpar, the coffee itself is bitter and reddish colored, and their specialty drinks are even worse. my iced mocha had clumps of chocolate in it. wtf? avoid this place at all costs.had a chai latte, which was perfectly balanced. delicious foam. savory scone was nice and tasty.the oat latte is what people search for their entire lives. it's a latte so perfectly crafted it deserves to be in sears. get it? craftsman? no. okay. but seriously, try it iced. it's just so yum.i honestly can say that the customer service is awesome and the meals are great.my buddy tried black cat cappuccino and i purchased mocha latte which i find very good. i had a little sip of what he purchased and think it is average.had a good time! i likely will return.my latte was pretty good. the latte art is always a nice bonus. i wish they had almond milk as a milk substitute.a couple of coworkers brought me by intelligentsia recently and i really enjoyed myself. the highest marks belong to the ambiance and just overall style and class of the venue. otherwise, i have never really been a fan of the coffee at intelligentsia, it just has some weird, put-off kind of taste to me; hard to explain.otherwise, i would come back in hopes to find a tea i could enjoy in the cool, modern space that is inteliigentsia. a definite plus is that the staff members are really nice and helpful.intelligentsia is a really nice cosy place in loop. highly professional staff and great coffee quality. i ordered the almond cappuccino made from kunga maitu, kenya beans. it has the typical berry/black current flavor of kenya beans. overall profile is very well balanced and smooth. it smells woody and nutty with a consistent beauty-berry-sour taste. the finish is bitter and neat.enjoyed the visit. will try out the new york location too. congrats intelligentsia on making the 20 year anniversary! may the goodness continue for another 20 years!why does this place exist is my question. the prices are outrageous.the staff is very rude. this place really could use diversity training.in my opinion, any coffee shop beats this place.  what does it cost to have some customer service and a smile? they remodeled the store but not the attitudes of the staff. re do everything not just one thing.affordable high quality.  love and loyal to intelligentsia since lakeview and day 1 of this location.menu -- i love options!  sophisticated than ever.  quality beans.  generous standardized art latte.  macchiato automatically came with lightly fizzy water.  the angeleno with 4 shots of espresso for $5.5 is an excellent value.  you can have 2.5 shots for half the price.  how hard does your heart palpitate?  *wink*venue -- plenty of comfortable seating that easily gets crowded.  2 unisex bathrooms.  due to limited space, this cafe is not meant for hours-and-hours of lounging.unknown to me, i walked in one minute before the registers closed down for the night.  whoops.  i was in chicago for a conference and stopped here because it was on my list of coffee places to visit.  when i got to the register the barista said there was one minute left before it would close.  i really wanted a coffee and they looked as if they were just finishing cleaning up their equipment.  the manager saved the day by offering me a free drip coffee, which was brewed only 20 minutes prior, and we were all happy :)they made me an excellent flat white, despite it not being a menu item :)   bit of a wait but the place was pretty busy.  found a seat ok and jumped on the wifi to do a little work before grabbing another flat white to go.  nice ambience and friendly staff with the hipster vibe$4.46 for a medium cup of coffee? lol!!!why on earth would anyone return? is the coffee that great? nope.visiting from out of state and we happened to walk by. stopped in for a coffee and chai (really good). cool place, great quality.the pour overs and espresso need no additional reviews - all has been said about how delicious they are - i had an oatmilk cappuccino. i must add that the rooibos tea was a surprisingly fantastic selection on a rainy, dreary evening. if you are looking for a non-caffeinated option, order the rooibos. enjoy!awesome coffee.  had a soy latte.  so smooth, so strong.  so delicious.  the croissants with almond are quite delicious, too.  well worth the price/the trek if you aren't nearby.  just stock up on their bags of coffee!matcha latte almost makes me cry! as a big fan of the real coffee and tea, i was fed up with the starbucks style super sweet something. and here i am! love it, love it, love it! takes me back to kyoto!it was a really bad experience! i don't recommend drinking espresso coffee, the test was the worse that i never had before! besides it is really expensive, more than 5 dollars! the service was crazy, i waited for more than 15 min for just one coffee! guys, maybe if you chose another drink you will have different experience! good luck! but my husband and i won't return here!this intelligentsia location is by the entrance of manadnock building on the corner of jackson and dearborn.  for those who work at the downtown loop area, this shouldn't be too difficult to find.  however, if you're new or visiting chicago, "dearborn" is a north-south running road, roughly speaking in between "state" and "michigan," the commercial, touristy street names that most of us are familiar with.  i happened to be in the area this afternoon and wanted to grab a cup of latte to-go before hopping on the blue line train for work.  this place seemed to have enough baristas on duty since people working in the office buildings should be tempting enough to load up some coffee in their useable cups or thermals.  i should bring mine as well to reduce the amount of paper cups we humans use daily.  obviously the prices on the menu already had tax included.  it doesn't necessarily make it easy for me since the "numbers" is really rosa j.'s middle name.  surely some of us like to see some integers and view any zero to nine on the right side of decimal as enemies!  i'm not sure if this is a good sit-down coffeeshop, for the business primarily caters to the downtown working professionals.  leaving the place with a quality cup of coffee to-go then heading to your final destination is always a choice!loved studying here during my visit to chicago! the coffee was really rich which took me a little bit to get used to, but in the sense that i was usually used to starbucks drinks. i got the vanilla latte which wasn't too sweet and was great for the cold day when i visited. the wifi was fast-- but it can slow down when it gets crowded. i got a seat the booth, but you should try to visit early as it gets crowded really fast.as far as top notch coffee goes, this place when's the award. they were along small farmers and growers to produce exclusive coffee for their stores, which are located in chicago, l.a., and n.y. c.. the coffee may only be available for limited times, because they work seasonally with growers to ensure the best quality and fair trade agreements.the coffee is brewed so every note and flavor comes through.  if you're drinking good coffee, sugar shouldn't be necessary because of the fruity, sweet flavors of the bean or cherry coming through to the end of the process.the atmosphere at this cafe is relaxed and friendly. the baristas and roasters do a wonderful job explaining the brand and assisting with questions.it took me four years of college until i finally got to intelligentsia. to be honest i didn't want to go. i always pictured intelligentsia as snobby because i know of a couple places in indy that serve it and i thought "hey now, why not serve an indy roaster you uppity poots"maybe these folks in indy just know good coffee because this was good coffee. the cold brew was so smooth that it could have played a mean saxophone solo. the loose leaf tea came in an awesome cup that warmed your hands and your heart. there was ample seating, good lighting, and opportunity to instagram (follow djeccles for my adventures) with popular pays for a free coffee. i wish i would have gotten over my intelligentsia fears and had this earlier. don't make the same mistakes i did my friend.a cozy coffee shop near the bean/michigan ave.i came in just to get a coffee in the morning. however, their foods look awesome! they have a great selection of pastries and drinks.love the place, and the people!i am pretty sure i will come back!i love intelligentsia coffee, so i was very excited to visit their cafes on my recent chicago trip. this location is a real looker, with marbled counters and tiled floors, and its street side location in the historic monadnock building. the baristas are as dapper as can be with their bowties and newsie's caps. necessary? no, but it's an aesthetically pleasing touch to this already classy place.we lingered a bit to get charged up for a long visit to the art institute, and enjoyed the buzz of the place. the paris bombings had happened a day or two before, and there was a community feeling with people getting together, discussing current events in french and english, and surprisingly not a lot of people tippy tapping on their computers or tablets. can't go wrong with any of their drinks. i had a classic chai, which was a warm treat on a windy day. i almost filled my suitcase with bags of beans, but bought just one, their ethiopian yirgacheffe, whose light and floral notes make me happy. would i have to choose just one intelligentsia location to patronize, this would be it. so much to enjoy just steps away, but a caffeinated oasis and shelter from the wind inside.i love everything about this place except its location...need to pick this up and move it along the route of my regular commute.  great art deco lighting, white marble tables, and the baristas here are artists.  i have yet to come across a better cappuccino in chicago.  this place makes me long to be called again for jury duty...a delightful cup of joe and a cool place to hang out. i wish i discovered this place on day 1 of my trip to chicago.great fast coffee with an atmosphere that is welcoming to linger in. i'll often get my coffee and brioche (great brioche) and change my mind about running back out the door into craziness.the patrons are lawyers and students so people watching isn't as much fun (because of the liability of being caught) but it's still a safe fun crowd of the priveleged who gather to self-caffeinate.i come here because it's close to the federal detention center (mcc) where i volunteer.delicious coffee in an amazing area! no better place to start your day than here! cafe pastries are offered here along with their drink options for a great light meal.my boyfriend and i ordered the 20th century blend and the vanilla latte. the blend coffee was very robust and strong. the vanilla latte was incredibly creamy, smooth, and had the perfect amount of sweetness! both were really really delicious! the space itself had a lot of standing space but the seating and tables were full. this is a great place to grab and go coffee but i would have loved to have sit down and enjoyed my drink. being in downtown chicago, this is to be expected, but walking around was no problem at all!shining example of the coffee-as-theatre flagship. gorgeous, with carefully composed drinks. the best coffee experience i had in 4 days in chicago.why is so difficult to find a decent espresso in this city? :(  i've tried intelligentsia at a few different locations and this one was no exception. their espresso is everything it's not supposed to be - some times bitter and other times sour. i don't know if the issue is with over-extraction or the temp, but i'm not dying to go back. also tried a cheese scone, which was underwhelming.this coffee shop is amazing! i tried their cold brew iced coffee with oat milk and i never want to drink any other coffee after tasting this! it's a small upscale shop. but beware they are not open on sundays. i will definitely be back!i love visiting here everytime i'm in chicago. fantastic experience every, single time! pour overs are always with the wait! some locations evening feature artisanal chocolates. be sure to grab a bag of black cat espresso to go and try the candies :-)good place to come for coffee. it has a mix of seating.. counter space, a couple of small tables and a larger community table. the coffee bar is large. takes up most of the store. they had 6 people working there, which seems like a lot for a coffee place, but it was super busy there, popular; they actually needed the volume of staff.i got a latte. i asked it for it skim, they only had 2% milk. it was creamy, subtle earth flavor. the espresso almost had no flavor. you can taste the milk and feel the caffeine but the espresso is super soft to taste. i also got a tea cake. it was like a pumpkin muffin with sugar crust and toasted pepitas on top. the difference between the tea cake and a pumpkin muffin was its softness. it was more fluffy than a muffin.. almost like a pumpkin flavored angel food. delicious. paired lovely with the coffee.i'm a west-coast coffee snob and need great espresso when i'm on the road. my day is rough until i get great coffee. thanks to this cafe intelligentsia, all my chicago days are wonderful. the staff is professional, chipper, great-looking, and fun. the coffee is real, delicious, and effective. the atmosphere is fabulous. clean and upscale, the patrons are mostly hip, high-performing looking people that range from business to artist to student. i love it here!my go-to coffeeshop in this part of the loop. partly because there's not many other options. although there's usually a 2-5 person line around 10a most days, it moves quickly enough.it's a warm refuge on those windy winter days when you need to get out the office because your manager is micro-managing you. or the office coffee still tastes like metal.black cat classic latte $4 (dark chocolate and ripe cherry). good coffee at the perfect warm temperature that doesn't burn your mouth. adorable latte art. super hipster. i usually come here when i'm waiting to eat at wildberry. it's a good way to kill some time.stopped here on a recent trip and ordered a black coffee.  the staff was friendly and the coffee was delicious.  it has a little something extra to it.  i would definitely go back!i have traveled a lot, and i have to say this is probably one of the best coffee spots i've visited in chicago. try the unique #chemex.with success comes popularity, so be prepared to wait.surprisingly affordable prices for a hip place like this in downtown. i had a cappuccino that was well prepared, in a nice mug that went down smooth.  a pleasant break from the monotony of starbucks. well donei finally had an opportunity to try intelligentsia coffee at their place of origin - chicago. this is one of the six chicago locations (as of october 2015) and it is also conveniently located right next to the millennium park. i've visited intelligentsia coffee once before (in pasadena, ca) and their black cat organic latte was really good; however, i wanted to try something else and i decided to stick with the only available cold coffee drink on the menu - cold brewed coffee.***cold brewed iced coffee + almond croissant: cold brewed iced coffee tasted slightly acidic (sour), but it wasn't overwhelming enough to interfere with the overall flavors. almond croissant tasted pretty good, but nothing too spectacular.***hey intelligentsia coffee is chicago's signature coffee shop, so you should definitely give it a try. p.s. - intelligentsia also offers public roasting works tours once a month for $30 per person ().intelligenista is the perfect place for a splendid cup of coffee for your morning. having a lively and hippy atmosphere, this coffee shop is designed to make you feel relaxed but at the same time, productive. their latte art is extremely on point - delicate and clean. the latte itself is foamy, creamy and has just the right amount of sweetness enhancement. what we found behind each cup of coffee is the coffee bean served here has been roasted locally. that is the most important thing which gives the taste of intelligenista's coffee strong, fresh, robust yet extremely fragrant. the unique flavor remains in every sip, which is impressive. when you walk in here, you're in for a treat. they also have a small variation of pastry in case you crave something simple for breakfast.recommended : mocha cappuccino, almond croissants, vanilla lattefor more, visit us at:i know that intelligentsia coffee isn't exclusive to chicago, but i like to think it is since it originated there.  whenever i visit chicago, i try to grab a cup of coffee from here.  the coffee is strong but quality.  also, the coffee shop is nearby many attractions like millennium park, the bean, and the chicago art museum.  try their iced coffees and lattes if you can, they're very strong and tasty.  it'll go straight to your brain!overall: great coffee spot in chicagocame here while on a business trip for a conference at the mccormick. after trying a sample i ordered the cold brew carbonated turmeric tonic. it was refreshing and settled down my traveler's belly. the staff even moved a table for me so i could recharge my cell phone.i almost feel like i wasted my order here since i only got a plain ole drip coffee and an oatmeal chocolate chip walnut cookie. but, no regrets! it was an amazing cup (actually more, since they serve it you in a mug + a tiny pitcher on a tray) of coffee with a mellow flavor. the cookie was moist and full of chocolate chips. which is the only way i like my oatmeal cookies. i spent some time inside catching up on work, and it was constantly buzzing with activity, even up until an hour of closing. if i lived in this city, i would definitely come back and try everything on the menu!very clean. decent coffee. i had the almond croissant and it's by far the best almond croissant i've ever had. even if you don't like coffee, come for a pastry.i never expect to find good coffee in chicago, to be honest. chicago is never known for its coffee as compared to seattle, portland or san francisco but intelligentsia coffee was pretty impressive. i came here for 2 consecutive mornings for breakfast since it's less than 50 meters from my airbnb apartment on east washington street. had latte on the first morning and soy chai latte the second day. both were smooth and not acidic at all. what makes intelligentsia coffee shines is their pastry from floriole bakery. i tried a couple and chocolate almond croissant was my favorite. the pain au chocolate and butter croissant were good too. besides coffee, they have an impressive list of teas available and wished i have more days in the city to try them. sparkling tea on tap. how cool is that? the space is beautiful and very hipster. the baristas do dressed up in suit with tie or bow. don't get too intimidated with their dressing, they are all very friendly and could recommend some blend if you're not familiar or first timer to their coffee. morning crowd consist of office workers as well as those who came back after a good workout in the city. if you're cycling, just drag your bicycle in with you!i really wish i liked this place better.   intelligentsia is chicago's foremost coffee roaster, and their beans always smell amazing.   i don't think there's anywhere else in town that takes coffee brewing more seriously.good:   always imaginative and sophisticated coffee to choose from.   nice to have the option to get pour-over.   i don't think i know anywhere else that does that.   good service.   nice cafe atmosphere.   great place to meet co-workers or clients.   i'm in here every now and then for that reason alone.meh:  i may be alone on this, but i don't find the beans to be sufficiently roasted, and this impacts the quality of the eventual pour.   could just be a matter of taste.also, the price -- my goodness.   $22 for a bag of coffee (and $5 for a cup, with tip) is just too danged much, thank you.   i make a comfortable living, and this still feels like an indulgence.   i am left feeling like i don't get enough for my money, in spite of everything.probably the best coffee i had in chicago! i love the clean upscale vibes that were given off by the high tables, bar seating, and the baristas all dressed in vests and ties. very cute & definitely left an impression.their espresso was rich but not overpowering, and the lattes were beautiful & smooth.apparently, there are several intelligentsia's in chicago, and other places use their beans as well, so if you're in town i recommend checking it out.this place is located a few minutes away from millennium park. it's a small coffee shop located in a busy area. i ordered an iced soy latte and it was strong. caffeine was necessary that day, so much appreciated. i think the drinks are around $4-6?if you need a quick caffeine fix while visiting the famous bean, stop here for coffee!can you ever go wrong here? all of the coffee and kilogram tea choices are the right choice. they have a very tasty chai tea latte. at times the line is quite long but, depending on what you get, it goes pretty fast. there is a large variety of fresh coffee beans (and when i mean fresh i mean a day or 2 old). we also got $3 off of our drink for each bag of beans we bought. if you're lucky they will also have a discounted roast available.  they do have some pastries available.they make good coffee. i just wish their specials of the day didn't cost so much a cup. $6 cup of brewed coffee, ouch.*note* they apparently give you more coffee if you sit in and drink! coming back for sure then!small store, busy location. but staff was nice and the coffee came quickly so what's to complain about? also even though it's a city coffee shop (hence small size) and not a lot of sitting room, there's a lot more space in the front of the store (waiting area), which helps it feel more open/not as claustrophobic.arrived here on a saturday at 11am before heading to see the bean. let me tell you, there was a line already. there is always a wait it seems. i ordered the the angelino. it's a cold iced drink. it was a good coffee. i would've preferred a caramel frap from starbucks though. i hear there's a version of this in los angeles too!probably won't be back. i didn't experience anything that wowed me. ps. you need a key from the person behind the register to use the restrooms!this location is close to millenium park so you can get all of your chicago must dos in one swoop. intelligentsia is one of chicago's best known roasters, so if you are a coffee person, you should definitely check it out. coffee here certainly wont be $1-2 as most are about $4-6 so if you are not willing to pay more for higher quality coffee, this is not the place for you. most recently i got the cold brew and my friend got an iced matcha...both refreshing...though the matcha was extra light so some simple syrup was needed.- i'm working my way down a list of top coffee places to try.  there is a reason why intelligentsia has been ranked so high year after year.  the coffee is amazing.  we ordered two different coffee varieties because we wanted to taste the difference between the two.  both were smooth but different in flavor.  the coffee i ordered had a slight sweetness.  the other coffee had a more bold and earthy taste.  i then decided that wasn't enough caffeine so i ordered a latte which was beautifully made.  the baristas are extremely knowledgeable, friendly and passionate about coffee.  my only complaint is the location seating fills up quickly.i had a terrific americano. but it was served in a paper cup :(. everyone else had mugs...  in summary, this is not a welcoming place. it is pretentious. any coffee shop in oregon has better coffee.  and it  won't  make you feel the need to schedule a therapy appointment to repair your self esteem after you visit.when i first walked into intelligentsia, one of the baristas was telling a patron that the coffee he was about to drink came from a species of bean that was new to the west. there was a pause... and then a "wow that was really unique." the conversation then shifted to genetics and how this is impacting the taste of coffee.this is the level nerdy science that permeates out of intelligentsia. and, simply ordering a gluten free muffin and latte involved a wealth of information. these people are super super super friendly and extroverted. i'm not sure where the owner finds these science-loving/coffee/chatty geeks... but i want to hire them.the coffee was fantastic. i'd expect nothing less from people to live, breathe, and think in coffee. beware... the lineups can be long.really liked the coffee flavor. hip but vintage kind of atmosphere and spent an afternoon working here. clean, bright, and bustling with people. high recommend for a study spot or place to catch up with friends.nice place, but alway crowded with lots of white collars. nice a choice if u just need to find a place to sit down and read. nice coffee !normally i get coffee, but today i decided on chai tea. i'm trying to cut back on the sugar so i requested less sweetness; however, it's already mixed with the chai. i decided to bite the bullet and opt for less chai syrup. to my surprise, it was as flavorful, spicy, and bold as i had expected. it was a refreshing break on a hot day.in other news, this location is large with plenty of seating. the line moves quickly and so do the drinks.ordered a black tea and after a little while was handed a drink with the barista prattling off whatever fancy name it was. i turned around and looked at it, turned out it was a coffee so i set it back down and said i ordered a tea. a moment later a flustered businessman walks over and sees i was given his coffee by mistake. he gets fussy, clearly upset somebody touched his wake-up juice. i say "it's fine, i just picked it up" and he muttered some bad language, i replied "seriously? it's fine, i didn't drink it" and he goes off mumbling and swearing "are you kidding me?", "prick", etc. the barista profusely apologizes, offers the man a free coffee noting he comes in every day, a drink token and more apologies. the guy takes another coffee and storms off. i muse to the barista that people can sure be cranky before their coffee and he just says "well, you know..." in a way that says "i hope the big businessman returns again tomorrow". okay, great. so i come in once in a blue moon and get cussed out by an entitled suit, get no apology or acknowledgement. but mr. daily customer gets coddled because somebody else touched his big boy dwink. pathetic. i'll just get my coffee at dollop or starbucks or whatever from now on.really trendy coffee shop. basically the starbucks of chicago but much better. prices are high but they are more worth it than starbucks. the chai lattes are fantastic, but i would also highly recommend the angelino.i want to apologize to any yelpers that read my prior review.  it was posted to the wrong location.  intelligentsia is a wonderful tea connoisseur - it got me through much of law school.really enjoyed the pour overs i had here. lattes looked amazing also. nice location and good service.do yourself a favor and stop drinking starbucks and start drinking this/local coffee once in a while. intelligentsia is a treat, help yourself to it. the west coast has blue bottle and the midwest has intelligentsia. the coffee is always flavorful and so well made with the integrity coffee and the coffee farmers deserve. the staff take their coffee seriously and while they turn over a lot of drinks throughout the day, each drink is tentatively made. they're not so bored of making coffee that they need to purposefully mess up your name to entertain themselves. every barista makes a proper and flavorful drink every time. this place does get busy but if you're there when the crowd is small, it's a very relaxing place. if you sit at the counter, the baristas pouring drip coffee are always happy to share a conversation. get over the "hipster vibe", they make damn good coffee.-order with a smilethe vanilla latte is delicious! and the latte art was done really well.. typically, i'm not a latte drinker but was slightly pressured into it from the other yelp reviews :p glad i got it! not too sweet, just the right balance. i did also try a kenyan blend coffee.. not sure how i felt about it. i do typically drink/prefer south american coffee, so it's probably just a personal preference. wanted to try something different is all! the ambience is very "hipster", which i personally liked. it's also great location (right off of millenium park), and i actually stopped by during my wait for wildberry pancakes up the street :)great ambiance, and delicious coffee. the mocha was smooth and rich with just the perfect balance of coffee and chocolate. will be back to try other drinks and the chocolate croissant (which they were sold out of the last time i came).very great coffee and cake, it is definitely worth your money and it was packed. we sat bar table which was also nice.their icon reminds me of a flight attendant's badge.their drip coffee is as smooth as you can get!  ordered up their kenya coffee and it was surely swell.  their oolong tea was aye okay.  didn't care for it.it's a pleasant coffee and tea shop, but more for their coffee!if you haven't been, i recommend for anyone looking for a premium coffee shop. is it expensive? sure. but at least the coffee is worth it. i had the karyenda burundi via the chemex. it was great. just the right amount of acidity and citrusy notes. i also recommend some of the other varieties they have. they usually do a great job. the shop itself is pretty cool. the whole industrial look with a decent amount of seating for a small shop. the other draw was also the bakery. i had a buckwheat scone with fruit preserves and it just sweet enough but filling. good stuffmy only complaint is the price. i know it's all about convenience i get that. they make it for you, but i can do a chemex too. it isn't very hard and getting premium beans is easier than ever. i even do my own roasting so a cup of premo coffee that is over $5 bucks just isn't worth it, frequently. i still think they will do fine but if you look at a simple v60 or chemex and go online for good beans, you can do it on the cheap and get almost as good coffee. if that is too much work, then these guys are definitely your answer!yes!!! intelligent coffee and tea.  they carry organic coffee and tea selection. i had the organic sencha following their recommendation. so yummy and delicious.   kilogram tea is the brand that they carry. never heard of it but i am quite impressed with the quality.  they even carry proper clay japanese tea pots.  i was super close in buying the cute little pot except i thought it would be too delicate to travel.  they have so many useful accessories showcased and very useful looking.  i must say that my partner also enjoyed his latte and was very happy with the rich and bold flavour.  the servers are happy and passionate and inasmuch as there is a hipster vibe, in the end i think everyone just loves the beverages and seriously enjoy their drinks.  i am glad i tried it and the good thing is that manic coffee apparently carries their coffee so i know we have a bit of it's magic here in to.as i mentioned in my check- in, no trip to chicago would be complete without a stop at intelligentsia. the chicago coffee scene is akin to this coffee chain, you can tell just from the widespread availability of this particular coffee brand.my initial plan was to visit the original location, but i was a ways away, so i chose to stop by this location since i was in the immediate area. luckily, it was a good location and the store set up was awesome.the neon light wall creates a vibrance that adds spunk to an already bustling store. i also like the fact that they have a counter top right by the espresso bar, allowing you to watch the baristas while at work. i dropped in for an espresso paired with a decadent brownie from their pastry counter, and that was the perfect pairing. the chocolatey flavor went well with the robust espresso finish. intelligentsia was the perfect coffee finish to an already great chicago trip. the staff was friendly and worked fast, and this particular location is placed amongst some of the best attractions in downtown chicago.dis place be dank.we have them in la, but i've never gone. apparently chicago came first.i ordered an americano ($2.75) and it was just fine.why i'm giving this place a 5-star review is because i sat at the bar and chatted it up with the barista, yes, i was probably distracting and annoying, but he was chill about it. i learned a tonnnnn about cofffeee and would def kick it here again.my favorite coffee places in chicago - i visit there every single time i'm in chicago. why? good location - by the bean ;) or inside the museum. and also delicious coffee!it is pretty busy almost all the times i've visited, but the turnover rate is also pretty good. i usually don't wait for more than 10 minutes to get seats for two. at some point, there was also student discount! show your student card! remember to try - angelo (4 espresso shots) in a sweet ice coffee; coffee flight (somehow not as acidic as general pours); single-origin espresso shots (my honey's fave). be patient, but if your drink doesn't show up in 10 minutes, ask them about your order. if they forgot, they are truly apologetic and give you your next drink free! thank you for super charging my visits to chicago! love your coffee!bleh - i'm a big intelligentsia fan and am a usual proponent of their coffee beans. typically my best pour overs in the city come from here, but during my last visit i was disappointed. it was probably because of the holiday rush. it was during the last 2 weeks of december, the cafe was busy, and there was a barista making multiple pourovers at once - which mine didn't turn out to be all that great and a bit watered down. pastries were $4 just for a chocolate croissant, and i ended up forking over $10+ including tip for the whole thing. i was a little disappointed.another barista salvaged the experience when i asked for a to go cup, which she gave and topped off my remaining coffee with additional of the same kind. i was appreciate of that. i'll be back, but just a little less excited the next time around.dear intelligentsia coffee,i've been drinking your coffee for almost 2 decades and black cat classic has long been the standard by which i compare other espresso blends. this particular intelligentsia was for many years my favorite of all your coffeebars. i went with the flow when you stopped steaming milk for iced lattes b/c of california health code (btw. i'd even sign a waiver for the extra botulism risk. it's a texture thing) and when you changed your chocolate provider from valrhona to tcho to askinosie. i've accepted those changes and even admire others you've made over the years save one: your baristas at this coffee bar have no longer been as consistently anal retentive, and frankly, it's breaking my heart. please bring back the caliber of obsessive baristas that have captured my devoted drinking attention and $$$$ all these years! or, if it's the stress of the huge line that is making the baristas cut corners, can you please add meditation or yoga to bring back the coffee zen? my last few visits here my drinks have tasted like starschmucks. (and no i won't ask for a redo when the line is 15 people deep and the same stressed barista is making the drinks and my friend's drink sucks too. just make it all better. i beg you).yours truly,alma c., forever lover of black cat classic and of all baristas that render it nectar of the gods (as it's meant to be).ps i still get your awesome beans to go for home brew. great job on the new fancy bags.service was quick at this downtown location, especially for the amount of people ordering, waiting and otherwise hanging about the place.i ordered an espresso and my father ordered a cafe mocha. both came out quickly and we took our seats at the counter. he enjoyed his cafe mocha, but i found the espresso to be flavorless. more of a caffeine shot than anything else. i like the black cat project espresso blend intelligentsia carries, but for whatever reason my drink on this particular day didn't live up to the reputation intelligentsia carries.excellent coffee, nonexistent customer service. have been calling and emailing them for 5 days about a plate that arrived broken and about adding on an extra bag of coffee to my orer. coffee arrived before i was able to reach them. no response no answer the phone about broken plate. theres many great options for fresh roasted coffee online, and when you are buying a premium product- customer service counts!ah. how much i love coffee but only when it's really done right. this place was all over chicago, so naturally i had to try it out. upon entering it definitely has a snobby hipster vibe. no poor folk walking in this place. my friends and i came in on a busy friday, especially with this location. right in downtown near millennium park. the location itself is good, right by buses. metro and easy walking distance to michigan avenue. when you walk in the staff barley looks your way or acknowledges you. they are wearing ties? and vests? and half suits? like seriously, who needs to wear these things to make excellent coffee? i would rather a person who dresses normal who makes me awesome things. i'm not a fancy person by any means but i was a bit thrown off by that.as far as the coffee shop thing goes i was disappointed that as a 'real coffee bar' they did not have skim, fat free or 1 percent milk options. i was told they only had 2 percent or whole milk. i am lactose intolerant so to me this was ridiculous. especially to a place that is pretty much ruling the market in chicago. wake up! even starbucks has nonfat milk intelligentista...the beans themselves were quite good, and i suffered with a 2 percent latte just to try it. i was not disappointed by the quality of the coffee at all. their quality is probably closer to an a then a b, and if i could have it with skim milk it would probably be awesome. sadly they did not have that option for me. as for returning to this particular coffee shop, i wouldn't. i would probably hit up some of the smaller, local coffee joints that are not as 'business professional' and always have grade a beans and nonfat milk i.e. wormhole or hero coffee bar to name a few.the high star reviews drew me in, but i was left underwhelmed. the line was fairly long to order and the wait to get my drink was even longer. the atmosphere seemed to match the city of chicago with neon lights on the wall, high ceilings and super chic employees sporting fancy haircuts and piercings. i ordered the black cat latte. on the menu it stated they used dark chocolate and cherries. i asked the barista about this and ordered it, but i must of been misunderstood somehow because my drink was distinctly a plain latte and not my favorite at that. glad i tried chicago's signature coffee, but i won't be returning.i'm going to have to come back and try something else.  when i walked in on saturday morning, i wasn't expecting a line that long.  it was the busiest i've ever seen a coffee shop.  i really just wanted something quick like dd or starbucks but since i've been wanting to try intelligentsia since my days of living in dallas, i jumped in line.  it was 12 mins and $6 for a macchiato.  and this is the real macchiato.  you know how sometimes you'll go to dd and order an espresso drink and it'll come in a huge cup that's filled with something similar to condensed milk? the real thing is just like a shot of espresso with a little milk which was great but i felt like i waited half a century while standing awkwardly close to a family the entire time waiting for my drink because it was that crowded.  it was pretty good, but hard for me to really judge a drink that can be downed in 2 seconds.  what i did notice was that the ethiopian espresso was a lot more subtle in flavor compared to some of the other espresso drinks i've had.  not sure if that's just the difference in how they make their drinks or the country of where the beans are from.  what do i know? i'm no coffee bean expert.i really want to come back and try their regular black coffee.  well, nothing in here is "regular", so i retract that last statement.  even their black drip comes on a fancy tray with a ceramic cup and a mini glass carafe of leftover coffee.  i wonder if the employees would have a heart attack if i ordered one and busted out my personal stash of the cheap non-dairy creamers you find at a gas station?  4 stars just because the employees were incredibly nice and took their time making each drink even though the room was crowded more than a sardine can.was referred to intelligentsia coffee and from the reviews got their black cat latte. it was ok? got their savory scone which was delicious enough to compensate. line was long, latte art was beautiful, everyone and their business partner seemed to be working out of this location though.basically the same review as i posted for their store in pasadena, ca: superlative cold brew iced coffee made and served by really nice  people in a store with a really cool name.  love this place. a lot.every time when i am in chicago, i always try to have at least a cup of intelligentsia coffee.love this location! right next to millennium park, you can always grab a coffee to go and enjoy some open space in the park on a sunny day.but of course, i rather stay in and enjoy my cappuccino and watch the barista pulling espresso shots, creating lovely latte art or doing a pour over. love their outfits too!though the line seems to be long at times, but the wait is not that long! and their coffee is definitely worth the wait!i was wooed (is that how you spell it?) by the other positive reviews so i took the short walk from my hotel to the intelligentsia coffee location on e. randolph street. there were a few people ahead of me but the latte came out quickly. the foam art on top was really pretty and the foam stayed in tact -don't know if that is good or bad but the whole latte was smooth and very enjoyable. i also tried a sugar roll type pastry and it was tasty. a perfect little mid morning sugar rush.came here for the last stop of my chicago trip. the concierge at the hotel i was staying at recommended this place as an early morning pick-me-up before i had to go catch my flights. plus, it's tucked inside the monadnock building, one of the first skyscrapers in chicago. the shop is located right across from the giant usps office on jackson. the decor has a very vintage-y feel to it that made me feel like i was in a cafe car on a train. i also simultaneously felt like i time traveled to the past. all the baristas wore suspenders, which i thought was super cute! the walls are creamy, lit with warm-colored lights, and the fresh flowers in glass jars on the tables definitely added a homey touch, too!i had an iced soy latte and my brother had an iced mocha. drinks here aren't too strong. the iced mocha was on the chocolate-y side and the soy latte was refreshing without being provoking to say the least. i think i loved the decoration more than the coffee itself. if i could do it all over again, i would get there even earlier so i could just sit and enjoy my coffee for a little longer.so glad a co worker recommended this place.  great vibe and intelligent workers.   enjoyed the great coffee alsoi got the angeleno based on recommendations and it was delicious. more on the sweet side but it wasn't too sweet and the ice latte was delicious and perfect on the warm sunny day. however, it is a bit more expensive than the usual coffee shops. the baristas were very nice and they're quick to take your order and make it too. despite the line, everything moved along quickly and before i knew it, i was off with my delicious iced latte in hand.the angeleno was one of the highlights on my chicago trip! i highly recommend it!it's the little things that count at intelligentsia. the decor at the financial district "loop" location is indicative of the bustling businesses downtown: marble bar, baristas in bow ties/suspenders, brass on wood accents, and a classy feel overall. i ordered a simple shot of espresso, which was done just right. they serve mineral water with your coffee, which is an excellent palate cleanser and refreshment. i appreciate that, and definitely don't mind paying a few extra cents for it! friendly service, classy environment. well done.cute space, great location in the loop, and solid coffee. there's not much more to it, but if you're looking for a spot to grab a good cup of coffee then this is the perfect place for you. i ordered a latte and it was smooth and delicious.  no fancy frills here, so don't expect any crazy concoctions or flavors. simplicity is always the best way to go with coffee anyways.expensive (10$ for a latte and a chocolate croissant), and a very limited offer of bakery. coffee and croissant were very good.the anticipation for actually coming here was equal to the experience i had. settled just off michigan on a little side street, this particular location feels like one of those hidden gems in the city. but for all you fellow coffee snobs out there, it's the mecca of coffee. on this particular summer morning, i got the savory scone that did not disappoint! i'm not a sweet for breakfast kind of person, so it was the perfect morning pastry. for the beverage, and let's be real that's why we come here (well, and also to see the awesome interior!) on this round, i got the steamed chai. i'm so glad i did because it was delightful. spicy, not too sweet, and perfectly heated. i couldn't have asked for a better chai. can't wait to come back next time and try some more ambitious coffee! be prepared for a little bit of a wait though!we had to check out this chicago staple during our visit. there are plenty of locations throughout chicago, but this one is close to the loop and millennium park. service was friendly and quick by the entire team. we ordered an iced ginger plum tea, a chocolate chip cookie, and a drip coffee. all three items were great (especially the tea). the flavors were all there, and the cookie was dense with just the right amount of chew. if anything, it was a little buttery/greasy for my liking.i wish i had had a chance to sample their beverages made at the bar!intelligentsia serves some of the best coffees grown in the entire world. as a specialty coffee professional, i was very pleased with every aspect of our multiple visits to the millennial park location in chicago.the coffee and tea was outstanding. the service was stellar from 8 baristas, though one woman delivered an odd glance that seemed less-than-friendly for an unknown reason. that said, we felt welcomed and valued every minute.i highly suggest this intelligentsia location, as well as every other. it is a brand that cares for its customers and the coffee farmers it works with.i got the iced chai latte and it was pretty good. i feel like i got weird looks because it's a pretty hipster place and i'm just.... not hipster. my friend did not like her iced brew so she asked them to make her something else and they did.  they have a nice outdoor seating area and some seating inside but it's pretty limited.it's been a long time since i was last at this location. i would come here when i used to work downtown, but since i don't have a reason to be downtown anymore...anyway, i'm by no means a coffee snob. don't ask me what region of coffee i prefer...i just know i like it dark and i like it strong and for it to taste good. most of the time i feel like i'm the only one that doesn't like starbucks.speaking of not liking starbucks, i'm not a fan of specialty coffee drinks like mochas, frappacinos, etc. i just like plain ole' coffee. the wildest i'll get is a chai latte (ooo...i know...pretty basic of me). intelligentsia seriously has the best tasting iced chai latte in all of chicagoland. it's not too sugary sweet. it's got an awesome amount of spice to it and just the right amount of sweetness. i'm drooling just thinking about it.i was there this past saturday on my way to the chicago cultural center. it wasn't too busy. i had forgotten how hipstery the baristas are. the lady cashier was a little off. she wasn't rude, but she wasn't the friendliest. the barista that made my drink was way friendlier. my company ordered iced tea and they really enjoyed it. said it was one of the best iced teas they've had.some people say intelligentsia is super pretentious. i never got that vibe from this location nor the one in the monadnock building. i just plain ole enjoy intelligentsia coffee. nom!
