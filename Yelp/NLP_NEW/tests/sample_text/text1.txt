On√© of my favorite places to pick something up in Chicago. If you're a coffee or tea drinker, you need to stop in take a look at Coffee & Tea Exchange. I'm so happy this place still remains the same. Barrels of coffee where you can see and smell varietals from all over the world -Peru, Brazil, US or the elusive Blue Mountain ($99/lb) can be found here. ~`#$%^&*()_+=\{\}\[\];:"<>@-/,

I used to buy green coffee beans to roast at home. It's actually really fun to home roast with a pot and then shaking the skins outside with a colander for the freshest roasted bean you can get! farmer market

Jars of black, white,  bakery green and herbal tea line the back walls of the counter. The staff always encourages you to sniff as many as you like before you purchase. Most loose leaf teas are roughly $3/oz which gets you several servings, they also have the flowering teas that will be a premium price. The best part is you can find a wide range of flavors and  getting a small bag to try is such an affordable luxury. As I'm writing this review, I'm sipping on a Pear Ginger herbal tea. It's absolutely wonderful.
