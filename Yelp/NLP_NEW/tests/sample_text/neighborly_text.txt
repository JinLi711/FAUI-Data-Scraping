this restaurant has reopened as peach's at currency exchange cafe.i stopped @peachs_exchange yesterday with my niece and..omg  i was killing my nieces shrimp & grits!!  the service is neighborhood friendly (gives the cheers vibe) and food was delicious.  if i wasn't on a tight budget this week i'd be back in there today.  those cheesy, creamy, flavorful grits with bacon, onions, tomatoes was doing a dance in my mouth.  i couldn't stop eating them. the shrimp were large and perfectly cooked where they were still succulent and popping with flavor. i ordered the peach bourbon french toast which was very tasty, but those grits stole the show.  i ended up getting my french toast to go and shared grits and truffle fries with my niece.the fries came with a delicious spicy creole sauce that would be perfect on salmon croquettes (getting on my next visit) and that had some amazing banana ketchup.the chef actually came out and talked to us about how they infuse the ketchup with bananas which was cool for my niece to hear and have more appreciation for our dining experience.  we experienced friendly service, omg delicious food at a decent price for fresh quality food. can't wait to get back.only a one star because it was closed. i've heard rave reviews about it.... i took the time to travel and saw the sign that it has been closed. i wish that folks would take the time to edit that on businesss pages yelp said it was open and so did google.they literally converted a currency exchange into a pretty nice café. i like how they have healthy options and on this part of the south side i was surprised by the diversity of the clientele. i went with a friend for brunch and was blown away by what my friend called a "biscuit". it was dense and cake-like with a high polished top and it was divine! i would love to have another of whatever that was. there is also a check-in offer her for a free biscuit if you spend over $10 which is pretty easy to do. i thought it was affordable and the service was really good. i'd like to go back and try other items.not so humbly submitted,michael c.my friend and i decided to give currency exchange a try and i'm glad we did! we went on a saturday afternoon and it was packed!!! they have musical entertainment from 1:00 to 4:00. it was such a welcoming environment and i loved the neighborhood bar feel.the place is huge!!! i heard soon they will be opening up for dinner as well. now onto the food... :). i have to start by saying they have some of the best collard greens i have ever tasted. i'm also a huge fan of the black history month special menu item - skunabay salmon + sweet corn relish + potato risotto. i took a slice of sweet potato pie with me and yummy! i love how reasonable the prices are and will definitely be back. service, food, and hospitality of executive chef lamar j moore were excellent!this past sunday; i had a need for some good food. i've heard so much about this place. i would see posting of live music, special events and great reviews on facebook. to my surprise; the currency exchange cafe is located in the washington park area. i didn't realize how close this place was to my home.  it's centrally close to the highway, red line, garfield transit line, hyde park and woodlawn. it's great to see that they employed young people. the staff are wonderful. the place is beautiful. i love rustic look. it has two levels. you're able to eat at bar, booth and great seated table throughout. visiting the currency exchange cafe gives that #throwback vibe. the music is old school, jazz, neo soul. great place for working , meeting with old & new friends and eating good. i will definitely come back. i came back the next day for the monday live jazz event.  i loved it.  first drink iwith a ticket is free ( soft drink, wine, beer, chai)please tip the bartender.. great servicecurrency exchange cafe is a great place to grab a coffee, connect to free wifi and plow through some work. it's a pretty chill vibe with a steady flow of patrons, but not too distracting. although i've never had rude service, the staff could be friendlier. the matcha green tea latte is my go-to. i love cec's active community involvement. check them out especially if you're like me (self diagnosed adhd) and can't focus at home.one of the coolest & coziest places i've been in chicago. i could spend all day here reading a book or working on some work. i highly recommend the drink called green goddess & for food the shrimp & grits or spicy chicken. if you live downtown or on the north side this is a must visit on the south side!i really love currency exchange cafe (cex). no matter how much i get angry at their slow service, or their forgetting to give me this or that, or for having to remind people several times to wipe off my table after the previous guests have long gone, i just keep coming back.this morning, i arrived right after they opened and the house was already full with a long ordering line, which was moving slowly as usual. they only have one person taking orders at the walk-up counter, and it is not uncommon for him or her to discuss menu items in great detail, socialize with guests, or host conversations with the barista or other servers who frequently gather behind the bar. in this way, i guess, the good vibe of the place is created. with every kind of soul music playing loudly in the background and all sorts of happy poc eating and laughing at individual and communal tables, it feels like home as soon as you walk through the door. and it smells like your mama has been in the back cooking all day and all your cousins and mama's friends and uncles are already there and having a good time. it's warm, cozy, and the workers have nappy hair, funky haircuts, and goodwill clothes accentuated by trendy sneakers and wakanda-type shyt. look to your left and see piping hot plates of pancakes and french toast with whipped cream and berries pass by as quickly as steaming soul bowls heaped high with fragrant collard greens peeking out from underneath over easy eggs. you stand in that fcuking line and wait because it's worth it when they do the shyt right.i order the honey latte every time i come, and it is made with love each and every time. it is the perfect balance of sweet, creamy espresso and heavenly foam with a touch of honey in the bottom of every cup. my favorite barista, the girl with the locs and big glasses, is not much for small talk. each time i visit, i just thankfully retrieve my perfect latte when she yells out my name. today, they never called out my name, so i had to go up and ask for my latte well after i'd already eaten most of my food. the food was so good, i didn't really want to get up, but they had also forgotten my biscuit and i wanted to see what it tasted like with my soul bowl (scrambled eggs, juicy collards, and bacon pieces heaped on top of hot, fried potatoes). when i asked about my latte and missing biscuit, the worker performed astonishment. he paused, looked at his ipad screen in shock, and said to me, "i don't know how that happened." [long pause that didn't include an apology] "we will get that right out to you, mam."it was my turn to pause because i wanted to cuss at him for faking. instead, i said, "and the biscuit?""yes, mam. and the biscuit."i walked back to my table, where earlier, before my food came, instead of a latte, another server had placed a small sign on my table that read "reserved @12:45." like beyonce said at coachella, ain't that a bytch? at that time, it was barely 10:15, and they were signaling for me to leave before my table even got wiped down. whatever.i sat back down and waited for my biscuit. the same boy i had reminded to bring it when he brought my food and promised to "be right back," showed up after a few minutes with a piping hot biscuit on a saucer. i was disproportionately happy when it came and thought, well at least it just came out of the oven. that must have been the hold-up. i happily ate it and soon, my latte arrived too, with a beautiful heart shape floating in the foam. i like to think it was to make up for being so late. i paused to work on an essay i had been writing, but when i went back to my biscuit a few minutes later, why was the mf hard as a rock!?!? well, if you know like i know, then you know the only time that happens is when bread has been microwaved! no wonder it was piping hot! why, oh, why they wanna play with me like this? i am so greedy that i ate it anyway, mad as could be. almost choked on it. it made a huge ball in my right cheek and took forever to wash down. i put some greens in my mouth to soften it up, gave up on my essay, and decided it was time to write this review. with just a few minor tweaks, mainly in service training and closer attention to the high volume cex continues to see, it can be the rockstar dining experience it's supposed to be. bus and wipe the tables down quicker. make servers carry tickets to ensure diners receive their full orders at once. come up with a better system for delivering drinks. and for god's sake, open up another ordering line! cex has mastered an aesthetic, as is evidenced by the crowd and by its fun sm presence. it has found a way to appeal to every kind of community member close to our beloved south side. and there is something for everybody at cex, but service must improve. the least cex could do is make sure everyone has what they need, on clean tables, after they have pre-paid good money for their good food.truly a unique little coffee shop. the food looked excellent, but the coffee was amazing. i believe they use back of the yards coffee and my cappuccino was wonderful. they have an attached reading room that can be rented out for private events which is really cool. the people who worked at the shop were incredibly nice and this place caters to a lot of tastes and seems like a neighborhood staple. i came thanks to a recommendation from a friend and am glad to have followed through. the shop itself is quite big, lots of cool lil places to sit and enjoy. they have $1 coffee on the go and on the menu it said bottomless coffee for $3 so the prices are just right too. enjoy!i don't get to come here that often but its a treat for two reasons.  i always run into friends from the community.  its a great comunity spot for meetings and such.  the food is always good.  i had a taco dinner.  what!??  ikr but it was perfect with two well flavored chicken tacos. no soggy shells they were cooked perfectly with a side of red beans, white rice and collards.  mmmmm mmmmm, so good.  each completed the other for a perfect bite each time. i also tried the ginger tumeric chai, very yummy.   my friend had the chicken sandwich with a side of collards.  everything is delicious which is why folks keep coming back.  not so hidden gem near the dusable museum and the hospital.  great choice outside of hyde park usual suspects.the space is gorgeous, the coffee is perfect, and the staff is knowledgeable and welcoming. whenever i have a meeting in hyde park, i always visit currency exchange cafe. this morning i brought my whole sales team and we each loved our breakfast! i had the cornmeal breaded catfish with collard greens and red beans because i need to be gluten-free. my colleagues had fluffy scrambled eggs, big stacks of pancakes, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding topped with real whipped cream. this is an outstanding restaurant!i wanted to try "currency exchange cafe" every time i passed through this part of south side.  for some reason i thought this place was at least a block west from the cta garfield green line station.  oh no, cec is literally across the road, though the signage could have been more conspicuous.  the building appeared to be antiquated, but it was the contrast between the "past" and "present" made the space remarkable.  i saw parts of the walls were purposefully left "untouched."  however, the coffee bar, the kitchen, and the restroom were clearly the new add-on or were renovated before opening for business. cec serves coffee, tea, mixed drinks, and food fresh from the kitchen.  orders are taken at the register, and items will be brought to the table.  i know this spot may be just a coffee shop for some; it's a solid light lunch spot for me.  both catfish po'boy ($8.5) and the shrimp & grits ($12, as of 02/19/2017) were delicious!  although there was minor clumping of the grits on the bottom of the bowl, after a few stirs that didn't really bother me.  they brew metropolis coffee.  hubby and i really had a blast this afternoon.  the only complaint was the portion size of each entree; a bit more generous servings would have been desirable for the prices we paid.  otherwise, a side of salad or chips would have been greatly appreciated.  looking for somewhere to take five in the south side?  if i happen to be in washington park or near the west end of the uofc campus, i certainly will stop in.this was my first go around at the currency exchange cafe so i tried sampling multiple items from the menu just to get a taste of as much food as possible. well unfortunately that didn't happen. of the relatively small menu, two items weren't available, of which one truly disappointed me. the restaurant couldn't make pancakes..... pancakes!!! i had a yearning for pancakes and they didn't have them during breakfast hours. realizing i already had two strikes and a third would've meant i giving up and just going somewhere else, i decided just to get a traditional breakfast. grits, egg, turkey sausage and their signature biscuit with a hot tea as my drink. everything thing i had was just alright. the setting was dope and the service setup was very unique for the restaurant's layout. it has the feel of a trendy restaurant that looks to turn into a neighborhood favorite casual meeting place. the patrons were very diverse in makeup, which is good because diversity makes everyone feel welcomed. all in all, i don't know if i'd try the cafe again for breakfast. the lunch menu has better reviews than the breakfast menu anyway.  plus i'd hate to come back and leave with an unfulfilled taste for pancakes!!!i love the atmosphere. i was here working since i work from home. my friend and i decided to order food. the menu sounds and looks amazing. but i wasn't pleased with the food. my standards are high since i am from louisiana. i order the fish and grits. it came with fried catfish, greens, a biscuit and of course grits.the catfish was so bland. no seasoning in the batter at all. was so disappointed. the biscuit came out and it looked amazing but tasted like cardboard. i tried to use jelly and the jam was too watery. now the greens were amazing. if you are working at times the music can be a little too loud. i don't think they know their identity yet. is it a coffee shop where ppl can work or a coffee shop/restaurant. i will give this place another chance and hopefully they amp up the seasoning on the food.this is an amazing little place right off the cta. all the staff are amazing, they have cool old rap/r&b playing, and a vintage vibe. more importantly, they are a "green" restaurant with composting, and support community organizations. the food is classic southern with a twist, and it is delicious! the lunch soul bowl i got was a soupy mix of southern goodness. i loved the bits of sausage i got in there. the shrimp and grits was a little soupy for me. four stars because the menu did not seem super diverse to me, though it looked great, and portions were a little small. i would go back for an afternoon coffee break and a bite of comfort food. great spot!this. spot. is. amazing!while exploring the washington park area, we stumbled across this neighborhood gem. we absolutely loved the food, drink, and atmosphere so much that we've returned several times since.why do we love this spot so much?first, the food is fresh, flavorful, and fantastic! house made biscuits and bread, hearty bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, the most delightfully flavorful house-made spicy fried chicken sandwich, delectable house-made jam, scrumptious metropolis coffee beverages, and so much more!second, the space has a fantastic atmosphere. clean, open, and homey, we found ourselves able to come to currency exchange for a variety of reasons. whether it be to tackle some work in the basement area with a plethora of wall plug-ins or to meet with a group of people and chat! all of your needs can be meet!third, it is a professional and comfortable coffee/lunch restaurant that makes it clear that all people are welcome. just as chicago is a sanctuary city, this cafe is a sanctuary cafe for all the locals, chicago explorers, and travelers that come through the doors.thanks for being fabulous, currency exchange. we will see you soon for our next dining adventure! :)visiting from michigan and stopped in here, everything i ate was delicious, fantastic service, great music, and excellent space. i highly recommend anything with the collard greens. the soup bowl was heaven. go there and then... you're welcome!hi,my husband and i visted currency exchange cafe (approx two weeks ago i think) on a rare saturday without our little ones.to be fair, i was unaware of the concept (not sure what you call it) of getting your own placeware, drinks, etc. ummm, ok. so, moving on. i was totally put off by paying first for a casual dining place. this is not a fast food joint. in addition, there was actually a tip option field on the self-order portals before you even get your food or have a chance to experience the service!  so, i already knew i wanted shrimp and grits as it was my understanding this was one of their specialties. the "waiter" had the nerve to tell me they do not serve shrimp and grits on the weekends. he said the rationale was to offer their client-base something "different" on the weekends since everyone orders this during the week. this literally makes no sense. creole/southern/soul food is a big part of their menu. like, why would you have fish and grits on the weekends (which my husband ordered) and not shrimp? i could tell dude was lying by the way he paused and stuttered. why not just say....we ran out of shrimp?i ordered the bottomless cofee. bottomless implies to me at least one refill right? two maybe? in order to get a refill you have to be given coffee almost immediately. i was not. after several minutes of me waiting i ask about my coffee. i was brought cold coffee. i take it back to the bar and the same waiter offers to make a fresh pot. i ask him if i should wait at the bar with him. he says no, he "will not forget about me this time". i literally watch him from our table making cocktails and what have you for several minutes. i eventually go back to the bar and just tell him to cancel the "bottomless" coffee as i was already halfway through my meal. he offers to give me a cup to go (this is not bottomless is it). they were unable to cancel but brought me $3 single dollar bills to my table. and as i think about it, why the heck would you charge for refills?music was good, but way too loud. maybe i am old. an older couple had to go downstairs. it was the weekend of the chosen few house picnic.hubby enjoyed his food. he said the greens were a little too sweet and the biscuit was more like cake, but still good. he would return. not me!i've recently started going into currency exchange fairly regularly. great locally sourced coffee and a nice environment to get some work done or chat with a friend. most of the coffee shops and cafes in the area are in hyde park and i find currency exchange to be a refreshing change of pace. i think it's a great addition to washington park and i love the whole arts block concept. if i had one complaint it would be that i wish they were open later! (they currently close at 4pm)first time going here..atomosphere is nice. enjoyed my shrimp & grits & biscuits were so good! my food order was misplaced but was rectified quickly & i received complimentary drink of my choice.i love the environment. staff are very friendly. the food was ok, i had the blue plate special. the greens were sweet and i didn't expect that and personally don't like it. the catfish was fried beautifully but lacked seasoning, as well as the red beans and rice. the biscuit is to die for!!! i also loved the pom pom drink. i will come back to try mo e dishes.this was an excellent dining experience, as soon as you walk into the establishment the smell of delicious well seasoned food. however you feel a little disoriented by the set up of how you order and find seating for your meal. i had the breakfast plate with pink panther limeade drink. the breakfast plate entails fresh light and fluffy pancakes, perfectly roasted potatoes, turkey sausage also including your choice style of eggs. through yelp they also gave us a hot biscuit. in conclusions i really enjoyed the meal, mars our waiter was perfect wish i knew that you pay before you eat, otherwise i would have given him a nice tip for his kind service. the cafe is really cozy and i can tell they love what they do. my only disappointment was the time length to receive the food could have been shorter, but otherwise i will be back for more!when you walk into this place, you forget that you just stepped out of the hood. i was greeted by the melodic sounds of a foreign land and the decor is a definite hipster vibe. don't wait to be seated, walk directly up to the counter and place your order. you will received a number to place at your table (a la nandos peri peri) and the server will bring you eats on out to you. grab you drinks, if ordered, and your silverware,  before heading to the table you select. the service was quick and did not disappoint. i had the breakfast plate, which was a basic meal. since becoming vegetarian, i'm always curious to see if restaurants will offer an alternative. the veggie sausage were, hands down, the best i've ever had. i don't reside in the area, but am around frequently. i can imagine that this place could become a part of the regular weekend ritual.this place is just awesome. love the food. delicious coffee and tea creations. great music. man i love this place. i'm going to enjoy this place because soon enough it'll be too packed.i love this place. it feels like love and home. like i'm in a wondrous land of beautiful blackness when i walk in. the music, the people, the food, the gorgeous staff, the decor, the vibe, the jet magazine covers on the wall... it's soothing to my soul. i had the blue plate for lunch. fried catfish (crispy and well seasoned) + greens (smooth as butter, perfect mix of savory and tang), red beans (creamy and well seasoned), white rice with stew tomatoes on top (the stew tomatoes was delectable) + a biscuit with the homemade preserves (fluffy, light and buttery, preserves were amazing). it took everything in my damn power to not drink the pot likka from the plate. i believe the entree is $12. best $12 i've ever spent.yaaaaaaaaaaaassssss!!! this place looks so hipster, whaaaaaaat??? it's so open! and they got that matcha????????? whaaaaaaaaat??? s/n: usually vegans or whole food shoppers know what matcha is. it's a type of green tea powder with mad caffeine. so i came here yesterday with my dad and cousin. its literally 4 blocks walking from my crib. 4. legit."yaaaaaaassssss queeeeen!"  *snaps fingers dramatically in a downward z*(i'm wilin' this morning... please bare with me! )i had a meal with grapefruit, a biscuit, and a hard boiled egg. yes i'm on a diet, bih summer is coming!  i ended up eating half of another biscuit and a side of turkey sausage.  don't judge me!!! my dad had potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit...and the chocolate mocha coffee. when i tell you this was so good!!!! omg. i look at my green goddess matcha iced latte like, 'why can't i be great, and fat? hmmm?' i can't. omg.so my cuz had a texas toast, egg, cheddar, and turkey sausage sandwich. she said it was buttered,  toasted, and cooked to perfection. and the eggs were so good and just had cheddar on 'em.*throws hands to the sky and screams* yaaas laaaawd!!!! (told you i am on one today...)so im geeked because i'm waiting to go again today with my bestie.  #winning#blackowned #serviceisgreat #blackhippie #southside #thatfoodsmackin and their prices are reasonable! we paid $36 for 3 people!!!! 3!!! yupppp.great place to eat at.....services and good was awesome......... our server was really nice he gave us a lot of hit tips we're definitely going to come back here and hang out love this placecurrency exchange is a great example of a place for everyone. we went again this morning. the service is warm and attentive. the french toast was...fresh, homemade whipped cream with spices. perfect. the coffee is some of my favorite in the city. and that $3 biscuit is worth it.  the grits too were yummy!this restaurant serves soul food. for it to also be located on the south side, it baffles why soul food is not also listed in the cuisine section. i visited with a friend. there was no hostess stating whether to sit or not, so people come in and look around, guessing what to do. we went to a table until 10 minutes of no server, we went to the bar to order. you wait standing there for your food and drink. i had collard greens (good), fried chicken (it lacked seasoning), and a very hard and cold biscuit. the serving size was literally for a first grader. i find it odd that they want a tip when there is no server. right after i tipped, i asked megan what was in the next room which they announced was open. i was waiting for my friend's food at the counter still. she said, "you'll have to go see for yourself." that's when i knew i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. we came from the west & south burbs. had just bought food and tipped (for no reason) and this was the "service." never again. i guess i was suppose to walk around with my food and drink in hand, with no info? this was her time to share with new patrons and create return customers, but no. better service and food is still had else where. venue looks nice (star). music was so loud, i couldn't hear my friend who sat directly next to me. free parking (star). the south side needs businesses but it needs businesses with good service even more.my best friend and i were here a few hours ago from the art incubator. i should have checked in for a free biscuit. anyway, i had the catfish poboy which was so good, seasoned and not fried hard. i love their fries too! i'm definitely coming back for breakfast!first time here and definitely will be back.  only had time to grab a cup of (bottomless) coffee but the vibe, prices and selections were all top notch.  conveniently located across the street from green line garfield stop, ce is a cool place to work, write, chat, etc.  the place has djs and live jazz once a month as well.  the only thing that it needs to change are the hours -- 8am to 4pm?! -- you're losing a ton of $$$ not being open for those that commute to work via the green line.  definitely want to try the food next time.i conduct many business meetings here and i just love the vibe.  the food is great, the music is straight from my playlists and the people are cool.  parking is not too bad if you arrive early enough, but it's manageable.i come here a good amount and it's obviously a great addition to the neighborhood. the food is usually fine, though it tends towards minimalism - the breakfast bowl, for instance, should probably have more than just one tiny egg in it.but the three stars are really for the dismal coffee, which is a recurring theme. the iced coffee, at least, really just tastes like water that has gone off. for the first time in my entire life i returned one the other day, and the lady working the coffee bar did not seem at alllll surprised by my revelation. the fact that it comes in a tiny, probably 8 once glass doesn't really help matters. so in sum, fix the coffee problem or switch providers and everything will be awesomedon't be fooled...great place, good food, nice location and very discreet. this is my third time here, i order something different every time.  the tacos are good, the soul food breakfast bowl is great, and the cobb salad with chicken, which i ate today, is phenomenal. oh the biscuit just makes the whole ordeal outstanding.this spot has easily become one of my favorite cafes. it is located right off the garfield green line stop. i highly recommend the greens. off the bat, the staff were super welcoming and they did not disappoint when handling the aux chord. missy, pharrell, brandy, erykah, and jill filled the space. worth checking out!!!so a friend recommend this place today for lunch, and it did not disappoint! the ambience of this place is really chill and laid back, my type of place. they offer soul food with a little bit of a twist! i had the shrimp and grits, which was my first time ever ordering it out at a restaurant. the grits were cooked perfect and so where the shrimp, it had this lemon gravy like sauce which was very strong in flavor, i did like it, even though at times it was a bit to strong, so if trying this beware of the bold seasonings in this dish! this place also has a coffee bar, which i tried their salted caramel almond espresso iced, which was very delicious! to top all of that off i had one of their home made biscuits with their homemade jam, my oh my it melted in my mouth!! the staff were extremely friendly and i would definitely try this place out again!!first time visiting and it was pretty good. went with my gf and we ordered brunch. i got the fish and grits which came with collard greens. i also got the vanilla bean coffee expresso which was pretty tasty. coming in caught me off guard because you have to order right away at the front where they make the coffee. didn't too much like that.. wanted to sit down and relax then look it over. you also have to pay before you even get the meal! so as we sat down no waiter came up and there was no water on the table. as i continued to look around i noticed others getting up and grabbing from a table, that's when i got up and saw that's where the water and napkins and knives forks etc are! someone should of said something off back. never been here and not knowing how things operate was very frustrating! but my catfish was delicious! food is very good here. i will be backhad an awesome lunch here today! sad i hadn't tried this place sooner! i had a southwest salad with chicken, they fry the tortilla strips fresh and the dressing is delicious . my husband had the fried chicken sandwich and said it was made perfectly. we both shared a biscuit which was super buttery and fluffy and delicious. the matcha and mint iced latte was soooooooooo good :) !!! the service was friendly and very accommodating and the prices were perfect for the portion sizes and clean atmosphere. we will be regular customers !this place is so eccentric, i love it! i've been a chicagoan my whole life and i'm so happy i discovered this cafe. whenever i'm in town, i will make a stop here. i got the shrimp and grits: delish! my friend ordered some fries and they were soooo good! they also had a dj who was killing it with the vibes. i love this place so much!i love this space! the food was delicious! i had the blue plate special with biscuit and tea. as a vegetarian, it's nice to find some soul food i can eat! :) the staff are incredibly friendly, the clientele is very diverse, which is a nice change from what i've seen in the rest of the city. and the space is beautiful. i will definitely be coming back here regularly. love supporting local businesses, especially when they're as good as this!i have been here two times and both times were consistently good. staff were nice as pleasant. i ordered something basic and it was good,especially the pancakes! they are always playing dope music! i will be back for sure!they are closed on mondays, so yelp needs to update the hours. i love the interior! there are three full floors. i had the soul food breakfast bowl. even though i don't like sugar in my greens, it made a great balance of sweet and savory and the greens were seasoned to perfection without the sugar.  the biscuits are to die for! the atmosphere is so laid-back and they serve rum punch! the music is like smooth house. the have dj duane powell from 1-4 on saturdays.the food is awesome! black owned business too! i've been here twice and i got no complaints.  great music too. make sure to check out the menue behind the bar to the left it has other drinks that aren't o the menue. go there asap!i was looking for a good post-race meal that would be marginally healthy, when yelp suggested this place near jackson park. it's actually in or around washington park, but it was only about a 10 minute divvy-ride, so i went for it.the divvy station is right across the (six-lane) street, which was pretty convenient; it's also pretty convenient to just get off the green line at garfield. anyways, i really liked the look of the inside, which i'm guessing took inspiration from a currency exchange that used to be on the site? i didn't ask, and i blame that on having just run a half-marathon.i ordered the chilaquiles, in part because i had no idea what they were. it's actually a lot of chips sitting in a jalapeño-tomato sauce, covered in chicken, sour cream, cheese and eggs, which i ordered scrambled. though i've seriously never been hungover, i suspect this would do quite nicely as a fixer-upper.the flavor was over-the-top good on these. chips were crispy, salty and flavorful, and the chicken was deliciously marinated in something resembling a distant cousin of jerk sauce. the sour cream went perfectly with fluffy, moist scrambled eggs. and the tomato sauce gave it a good kick to boot.it's a long haul from downtown, but it is worth your time to cash in at the currency exchange café.this place is amazing! the vibe is great. it's a small cafe right off the green line garfield stop. it's next to uchicago campus, but not filled with students at all. service/ambiance: everyone is very helpful. the owner is present almost every time we come in. it's very casual. you order at the coffee bar and your food is brought to you. even though it's casual, the place exudes class and comfort. all and all, you feel at home. the music is a great selection (frank ocean, etc.) and not too loud. laptops are not discouraged. wifi available. food:they offer a wide range of comfort food, southern soul food. i'm originally from the south, and the catfish is amazing. we ordered the catfish po'boy and the chicken sandwich. both were fried to perfection with a wonderful blend of spices. value:both sandwiches were $8.50, but absolutely worth the taste value. bottom line:check it out. worth going.so this is a really cool place! i mean the decor and the atmosphere are awesome. also, i had the salted caramel almond latte, which was sooooo good. as for the food, i honestly just thought it was average, so i can't give more than 3 stars. the prices were reasonable to me. i think one pancake was $3.50, 2 strips of bacon were $3.00, latte was $4.00, the grits were probably between $3-$4. the pancake tasted average, the biscuit was also average. the grits were a little too thick for me......kinda reminded me of when i make instant grits and don't use enough water, that could just be my preference. the bacon was actually good. also, everyone who works here seemed really friendly and nice!i would go back for the coffee or just to hangout, but i don't know about the food. nothing was terrible, it just wasn't above average. maybe it was an off day? i really don't know.less than expected experience. the ordering system is more like carry out. you order food and drinks at counter and pay before you pick a table for dine in. we picked a table which hadn't been cleaned from the prior guest. we made a "waitress" aware and it still took a while to get cleaned. when our drinks were ready, we had to fetch them from the counter. when food arrives we were made aware that we should have gotten our own silverware at the counter as well. i just don't understand or like the process. i wanted more food and drinks but i didn't want to get back in line to do so. the food was ok. the only saving grace for a star was my "coco loco" (cold brew, coconut and almond milk). it was divine! i don't see me making another trip from joliet for it though. also i left a generous tip that i wouldn't have had i known what i know now.i love the space at currency exchange. im a big fan of plants, natural light, booth seating, and tiles, and currency exchange hits all the marks! i also think they play great tunes to work to and overall, the ambient environment is perfect for catching up with a friend or getting some studying done. i love how they have good bottomless coffee for three dollars and really enjoyed how accommodating they were as they warmed up my bread pudding muffin upon request. prices are a little steep, but i feel like im paying more for the ambience rather than the food itself. the muffin, although tasty, was pretty dry even when it was heated up, but still tasty and full of chocolate. i will say though that the breakfast potatoes were out of this world: flavorful, crispy, and reasonably priced for the amount that you get. i think if i were to come back, i'd just get a drink, maybe the breakfast potatoes, and do some work, but overall, pretty fantastic cafe!good food, excellent coffee, and a comfortable relaxed atmosphere we will definitely be going back.i can't say enough good things about this place. excellent food, great atmosphere and good music. the catfish and grits and the lunch soul bowl are my favorites. the food is absolutely delicious, the staff is warm and friendly and they don't hound you to get up the second you're done with your food. i love this place!the food here so damn good so damn always!! whether the catfish is grilled or fried, it's very good. try the bourbon were tea, even at noon:) the greens are locally sourced. best restaurant greens i never had. the biscuit looks like a muffin, fluffy with a side of strawberry jam, with nice lumps of strawberry. come try them out.i've been here before and it was table service. when i came the last time i waited for 20 minutes at a table only to realize it's now an order at the counter place. i liked the chilaquiles before, but after waiting and not realizing the ordering had changed, i decided to leave cause i had already spent a lot of time there without direction and was beyond hungry.cool vibe and nice workspace to grab a quick bite.  i love their coffee and matcha drinks.  and the food is delicious as wellit's ridiculous how well-hidden this place is. stationed right at the garfield greenline stop, it's probably missed by most commuters like me. the concept is great - i believe they wanted to transform an abandoned building into a space for food and art. i ordered the chilaquiles and loved them! portions were very big. my other friends got the shrimp and grits and gumbo, but they didn't seem to be particularly good. portions for those dishes were also significantly smaller. it took awhile for us to be served but the waitress was very apologetic. i'm sure service is usually better. also, note that the free street corn for check-in is no longer valid. i'll definitely be back! so excited that spaces like these are popping up in south side.awesome place. casual and very kid friendly. helpful service. no fancy hipster menu but the food is good and prices are fair. coffee is excellent. i had a caramel latte. busy on a sunday morning with a short line to order at the counter but found seats easily and food came out quickly. nice neighborhood vibe too. easy parking.love the concept of this cafe and the interior design. food was mediocre to good.good afternoon,  this morning was my first time having breakfast at your establishment with my twin nieces.  we drove from the western suburbs to the city.. let me say that the food was quick and good. mostly the items they have on facebook,  they do not have,  maybe seasonal.  but the overall staff experience needs work:1. as i was standing at the counter the light skinned young man,  used his index finger to level ground coffee, and a female staff member took the measuring cup from him and used her index finger.  both did not use a utensil or had on gloves.  and then he proceeded to the register to take orders and money.  as i was giving him my order, i noticed he had scars/scabs on his knuckles. 2. when the same female employee brought our food,  my niece ask for the wifi, the employee said it very fast and walked away.  3. when the female employee called my name to pick up my beverage,  when she handed me the teas, it spilled on the saucer,  i had to ask for a clean saucer.  no apologies. 4. lastly,  the same male staff employee was carrying food to customers table,  with his pants falling,  we had to observe his blue stripe underwear,  in a restaurant. this was very unpleasant experience,  and my nieces who are teenagers felt the same way.  i try to explore them to other businesses outside of the suburbs. this makes me wonder about the kitchen staff,  i hope they follow the restaurant guidelines.  i hope this review will be taking into consideration. i frequent many coffee houses,  and they use the appropriate utensils or gloves.i really enjoy this place. built as part of theaster gates's community developments, the currency exchange café is across the street from the garfield green line and only about a mile from the uchicago campus. i've come here for breakfast twice now with my boyfriend and each time we had the breakfast plate (scrambled eggs with cheese, turkey sausage, home fries and a biscuit) and the breakfast sandwich on texas toast. the restaurant is beautiful and decorated rustically with found items. the service is a bit slow and one of the servers was a little dismissive of one of my requests. also i hope to god that they go back to their old biscuit recipe. but the meals are filling and it's a good place for the community.this place is a neighborhood gym. living in an area were there are not a lot of healthy food options and casual meeting place this is the best spot. my favorite dish is their soul bowl (collards, eggs, spuds and turkey sausage). came here for a meeting and it was nice, quiet and cozy. other menu items looked great as well. moderately priced and parking is so/so since it's right under the green line tracks. i'll be back !i went here for the first time.  the service was good and atmosphere was nice.  i enjoyed my blue plate special for the most part. i just thought the greens were a little too sweet for my taste. however i will be going back. i will just try something different next time.my go to work lunch or change of scene spot. near enough to uchicago for a quick mid day lunch via car but far enough way so that it doesn't get really crowded and isn't full of students. i love the chicken taco dinner served with rice, beans, and collard greens.wifi and coffee are reliably good as well. hip decor, great no frills service, and good vibes music makes this an easy 5 star spot.free street parking all around.much larger inside than it appears. coffee house feel, free wifiorder at the counter and food is brought to the tablei had a mimosa (6.50). really yummy. and the catfish and grits (i think it was $12). came with biscuit and greens. but, i heard the greens had sugar in them so i didn't get those.  i was in full fat girl mode so i ordered bacon...it was so good, i went back and got another side of bacon.  everybody liked their food and drinks the vibe was excellent and i will definitely be back on my next trip to chicago.   i love that it is on the south side.nice ambiance, and great coconut oolong tea - smooth and fabulous especially with some honey.  didn't eat but menu looks wonderful and i know it's all homemade and it smells soooo fabulous.  collard greens and catfish and biscuits and a plethora of other delightful lunch items.  i will eat here soon.update: yes, now i've eaten here one time and it is marvelous.  i got beans and rice and greens and a biscuit to go.  all of it.  every bit of it was delicious.  perfectly cooked and spiced beans and rice.  the greens were lovely and ever do slightly sweet.  the biscuit was mammoth sized, homemade and fabulous.  tender on the inside, crisp on the outside and served with homemade berry jam.  i'm coming back!great atmosphere nice and quiet upstairs there is  downstairs for very small meetings. food is great i had something simple because you can't mess up simple? they did excellent on the potatoes and scrambled eggs with cheese. even though the potatoes did not have onions they were very well seasoned. i will definitely return.update:  currency exchange cafe started accepting phone-in orders!  it has made such a difference.  i call in my order, and it's ready by the time i walk over.  so glad to see the service expanding.the staff is very friendly whenever i come in.  :-)had a tasty and fast breakfast at currency exchange. the food was incredible and the atmosphere was everything we could've wanted and more. midway through our mean the entire place burst into song to wish a fellow customer happy birthday. overall, great coffee and great food, with a lovely cafe vibe.this little rustic gem is beautiful! the staff is friendly and down to earth. the food is really good! i had the grilled chicken sandwich and fries. my friend had the fried catfish sandwich with fries. both plates were cleared!not totally vegan, but i'll take what was offered to me for breakfast. service was great and the staff was friendly to me. i ordered the tacos (made vegan friendly for me) and veggie sausage and the green goddess (yummy) had to mention to the manager that the cooks needed hair nets on or hats. but other than that, glad i'm around the corner from such a nice spotit's a cafe off the green line, that's a win right there. currency exchange is just about perfect whether you just want tea or coffee or need a bite to eat. if you're coming for breakfast, get the pancakes , coming for lunch , shrimp and grits or then blue plate special are sure wins. free wifi of course. longer hours would be great.this place looked cute on the inside and had a welcoming environment. however the overall experience fell flat of what i expected based off the reviews posted here. i had the cold brew and my bf had the hot coffee. these were on point and the strength and flavors were great (4 stars), but that's where it ended. i got the veggie tacos and maybe i should i have tried something like the biscuits everyone raves about. maybe my expectations are too high because i'm from texas, but i felt the veggie tacos were like what i could get at taco bell but twice the price. the tortillas were obviously store bought. beans were flavorless. they used iceberg lettuce on top with a small pitiful amount of tomatoes. they forgot my avocado that comes with the dish and they brought it out with no issue when i mentioned it was forgotten, but that didn't make it any better. i also got the free street corn yelp offer; all i can say is that i was glad it was free. had to add salt and it made the dish kind of good, but i've grown up with real street corn and that is not it. i can tell the corn was from a can. at lease roast real corn on the cob and chop it off the cob or don't do it at all if you are planning to use canned.also, the service was pretty lacking. the girls were nice but not attentive. i put in my coffee order right away then had to make an important call. 10 minutes later when i'm still on the phone, they come back to ask if i ordered anything. yes, i ordered cold brew. my friend got his salad before i got my coffee. after i got done with my phone call i had to flag them down multiple times to put in an order and it took way too long to get those two sad tacos. a disappointing experience overall. if you come, it's a cool place to hang out, but just get the coffee and not their food.highly recommend. food was very delicious, music is awesome   and feel so comfortable in here. definitely will come back to do some reading and work.my favorite hidden gem. this is our go to comfort home. the food is constantly good. music never misses a beat. community eating tables and specialty coffee drinks are a hit. i love this cafe for the vibes and involvement in the community. i'm so happy they are thriving in the neighborhood. you might even run into friends there, i know i have.i booked a private event here and was told everything was set. i ordered invitations and was very excited to celebrate my birthday at such a cool place. my event planner scheduled a meeting with the manager and the chef for a final walk through and to finalize the custom menu. i showed up for the meeting on time at 3pm-  only to be greeted by the manager who said "oh um yeah um um well the chef is no longer employed here and all events have been cancelled". my next question was "did this happen last night or this morning because i don't understand why you wouldn't contact us to let us know this and to cancel the meeting". the manager just stared at me and blinked and then said he could get someone for me to talk to. out comes the coo who basically shrugged and just blinked and said "we're just focused on the restaurant now and not events". i replied, my event is a month away and you're just casually telling me i've lost my venue like it's no big deal. he replied "sorry" and just stared blankly. fast forward one week to me getting an email inviting me to a special private/ticketed event happening at the restaurant on 7/1! so much for no more events! i was so upset. this place is unprofessional, inconsiderate, and they've wasted my time and my money. i've planned and hosted a multitude of events large and small all over the city from millennium park to small venues like space 1858 and this was the worst experience i've ever had. it's disappointing to not be able to support black owned small businesses because of shady unprofessional practices. there was no accountability and not even the slightest effort to make it right or be mildly accommodating. they didn't even offer me a glass of water while i waited and tried to sort out what was happening. to this day i've not heard from anyone, not the owner, manager, or coo with a sincere apology. should they go out of business i'm sure they will blame others for a lack of support and not themselves for running this place in such a garbage manner. cex is trash and i will never ever return. such a huge disappointment and inconvenience.stick with the breakfast food and you'll be happy. the green goddess is my go-to in all seasons (hot or iced) and the pancakes are great. outlets are plentiful and the music is good. i've found it a great spot to camp out and do work.i felt that they presented themselves like a  conventional restaurant with waitresses but you order and pay for your meal before you sit down.  you get your water, utensils and condiments yourself then sit and wait for them to bring your coffee or beverages but after the initial run you get it yourself. i ordered the fish and grits and when they brought out the food, the catfish had a chunk missing like it had been bitten. i am not exaggerating. fried fillet with 10% missing.  i pointed this out and they brought me a completely fresh meal.  my wife ordered decaf, they brought her regular.  instead of hiring seasoned restaurant staff, i think they went for a certain hipster look and hired people who have obviously never worked at a restaurant.  slow, half-informed with little in the way of charm.  i guess that's what you get when you offer no real opportunity to tip them anyway.  (i'm not tipping when i'm paying first genius)this was just a weird place.  i know they are new and will probably improve because the food is good.  but the hipster setup and process that somehow manages to use modern technology and still be inefficient,needs to be rethought entirely.  food: b+service: fenvironment: aparking: athe place is a nice cute coffee shop but has entrees. the cashier was very nice. my drink was really good. the french toast, greens, and catfish were good. the grits weren't good and the biscuits were just ok. i do like the ambiance of the place. i will come back.i love this place. the coffee is great, the staff are wonderful. it's a great place to spend a saturday morning reading or studying!i love this coffee spot. the space is great. it's a treat to work from here. i really like the decor. they have these little cubby areas that make you want to sit here all day. i love the bookshelves and one day when i'm not working maybe i'll grab a book. the food is good and has lots of vegan options. the music playlist is always great. check them out.this is my go-to place on the south side! best jambalaya, greens, fries etc. bottomless tea / coffee. great service from super chill, friendly staff. you get the feeling they actually care. awesome, comfy decor. thank you theaster gates and homies!i live a block from here and love almost everything about this place! i enjoy the small one dollar coffee for my dog walks and the occasional treat to go. the ambiance is top notch and employees are terrific. the cooked food is the only area of opportunity imo. theaster gates is making a wonderful artistic impression on this neighborhood.the food was good, the staff was friendly, and the ambiance was relaxing. i loved my experience here. i came here for lunch and i ordered the fish and grits and subbed though collards for rice and beans. the fish needed a little more salt but overall everything was pleasant. the rice and beans were everything i could have wanted. i was also a fan of the homemade jelly that the served with their biscuits. i will definitely be back to currency exchange cafe. this time, i'm bringing friends!honestly, i struggled to decide if i should even write a review for this place, since i didn't actually consume anything here. i met an interview subject here on sunday for an hour-long chat, and was totally unimpressed with the service. when i walked in, i couldn't figure out if i should seat myself or wait for someone to seat me. it was busy so i wound up seating myself while waiting to figure out where my subject was, but there was no acknowledgement of my presence for at least 5 minutes. no biggie - i figured out where my subject was seated and went over to her table anyways after perusing the menu for a few minutes. she had already ordered for herself and her sons, so i flagged down the waitress and ordered a hot apple cider before getting into my interview. she acknowledged my order but then... either totally forgot about it or the baristas just forgot to make my drink. at this point, my interview subject was talking so i didn't feel comfortable interrupting our interview to ask for my drink. service was slow overall but it seems like my subject was pretty happy with what she had ordered for herself and her sons, so that's why two stars instead of one. the music here was also really loud and didn't really give me a cafe vibe, and it was definitely hard for me to hear my conversation, even though i was just sitting on the opposite side of the table. i'm sure their drinks are great, but it just wasn't an awesome experience for me.in town on business.  checked the reviews and gave it shot and i must say a great experience.  was greeted by the friendliest gentleman who also let me know a few other places to visit while i'm in town.  if you are visiting chicago and want a nice meal in a comfortable setting then the currency exchange is a must.  the red eye coffee and the breakfast platter was delicious.this is a dope cafe in washington park on the southside.  it's got a hipster, earthy, mellow feel with great food and a good ambience.  i had the breakfast sandwich with a side of collard greens and it made for a very filling breakfast.easy to access right off the garfield green line stop.the only knock is the service started off great, then there was a huge gap in time to take our orders.  once our orders were in, the service picked back up.this cafe' is defintely a new concept and part of investment in a community that needs a commercial boost. i loved the feel of the place--very homey and artsy. many students were studying there and eating breakfast by 10 a.m. today. the server was very friendly and quick to ask us if we were only getting coffee or also food. my review, however, doesn't include food because we didn't have any. however, i only went in for their popular green goddess, a minty drink on my way to a longer driver. i ordered it with almond milk, and it was a mistake because it got very diluted (a 2/5 alone). anyhow, i would give this place another try due to the buzz about the chilaquiles and to support local businesses.very hit or miss. i love the place and want to support it, so i continue to go even though 50% of the time the staff is rude and 50% of the time the coffee is bland.i have enjoyed grabbing books off the bookshelves and reading while i drink my coffee; in fact i went in once a week for about six weeks and read an entire novel off their shelves.one member of the staff is my favorite café employee in the city, so as long as she works there, i'll keep going in.what a cool space and vibe! great place to study, chat, and enjoy some good food. i will be back when i am in the area. i ate the catfish and it was out of this world.greens so good you'll slap your mama!  love the look and vibe of this place. talk about an awesome re-use of am old space!  the food is also quite good and the menu is eclectic. think soul food with a twist (smelt tacos, beans and rice with veggie-chicken). the "blue plate specials" are priced right and well-portioned. highly recommend the greens (in case you missed that opening line).they still have some links to work out though. the beyond chicken was a little bland and the street corn was over-done, slightly tough, and had some really hard bits that did not sit so well on the teeth. the tacos were tasty all around though and, again, did i mention the greens?  :-)great service and a great start!the food is decent, but the portions aren't enough for a two year old. won't be back. waste of money.i give it an star because the place is really nice inside and the great location. however the service is unacceptable, not too many selections on the menu and the food wasn't exactly explained or specials were not offered. so to my conclusion i will not be back. very unfortunate because this place could have been my favorite spot. damnthis place is a hidden jewel in the neighborhood. it's great for families, day dates, girls brunches! i went once and came back 3x's in one month. loved it!i actually came for breakfast last year and haven't been back since. i totally forgot about this gem. i came today with co-workers and found out they are opening a wine bar book store next door. how dope!! i love this spot for our community! the artistry is defiantly alive in these rustic like spot!! and of course there is always neo soul blasting.. totally love it!!!.. shrimp and grits are so goodgod, i bring people from all over chicago for this. currency exchange is a mix of soul food and mexican food and a cafe environment! yes please!i can vouch for the soul bowl, the vegetarian taco dinner, all of the sides and the street corn. everything has a perfect spice profile. you can end the meal with a local palleta. what a freaking awesome place.love the atmosphere here since the place has lots of seating and the staff is so welcoming! so far each time i came here i've gotten the chilaquiles because it's the best thing ever and they give a huge portion of it!this is probably my favorite cafe in the city of chicago. the location is absolutely stunning- i could spend an entire day in there. it's easy to get to from the green line or mlk drive bus, has wide open hours, and super helpful sweet staff.the food is the real prize here though- the pancakes are among the best i've ever had, and i've also really enjoyed their tacos and donut holes. you can't really go wrong here. everyone also praises the biscuits, but that seems dangerous of me to even dabble with. keep going to this place, they deserve your business and they're good people.nice place to eat!  their biscuits are delicious!  not a fan of their shrimp and grits at all. it's not the typical shrimp and grits...it has some type of zest or citrus taste. my daughter had the pancakes and they looked good...looked homemade. overall, it was ok to me. service was awesome though.stopped in for breakfast on our way from chicago to champaign. what a fantastic find! the space is open and eclectically decorated; very sophisticated but fun. the two staff were incredibly friendly and answered any questions we had. we ordered the coco loco, la mañana, and chilaquiles. the coco loco cold brew with almond milk and coconut syrup was smooth and not overly sweet with great coconut flavor. la mañana was a nice light breakfast of ripe grapefruit, hard boiled egg and a soft, delicious, homemade biscuit. the chilaquiles were a perfectly proportioned mix of tortillas, chicken, and cheese with a fried egg and mouth-watering chipotle sauce. prices were great for portion sizes. if we are ever in the area, we'd definitely stop by again! highly recommended.i never knew this place existed until now they been open for about a year now. nice atmosphere for coffee, conversation & food u can also have events here. they have nice smooth music playing in background not too loud. the décor is interesting. now the food. i ordered the coco loco(cold coffee, coconut syrup & almond milk. the flavors were nice just wish the coffee was a tad stronger w/the ice it became watery. i had the breakfast bowl(2 eggs however u liked mine was fried w/ lil yoke they did it right in between rice & i had bacon which was diced up. it had decent flavor to it. the biscuit wasn't for me it wasn't flaky more doughy i'll pass on it next time. overall i'll go back & try the lunch menu. the day i went radio host mr. cliff kelley was there relaxing from wvon 1690 am.( i love his show this was a bonus)this is such a cool place!! loved the food atmosphere and customer service.. there were so may tasty items on the menu i didn't know what to get i decided to go w the pancakes which were light and fluffy, i also tried the iced green goddess amazing!!  i'll def return to try more of the deliciousness!! the food came out fast and the staff was very attentive.i am so pleasantly shocked to discover legit delicious food in hyde park. i've had the blt w/ fries and the blue plate special (sofrito rice, red beans, collards) so far, and both were fantastic and reasonably priced. the space is also just super artsy and cool--a great place to take out your laptop and use free wifi to do work or relax with a book.the coffee here is so good. i recommend the iced mocha with coconut milk.the location is very spacious. it's perfect for meeting someone for coffee or studying. they also have some outdoor seating.service is quick and friendly. 10/10 would highly recommend.i've been here three times now and i'm always disappointed by my drink or by the service. the first time i just ordered coffee and a banana, and the cashier did not understand how paying in cash works, considering that  i gave her coins so i wouldn't get coins back, and she proceeded to give me less money back as change... and she refused to see she was wrong. the next time i got a hot chocolate. it just tasted like warm milk. there was no chocolate flavor. this last time i got a pumpkin spice latte with almond milk. first they gave me the wrong drink (a hazelnut latte). they were nice enough to give me the drink and then make my own drink. but the drink they made me didn't taste like pumpkin and did not taste good at all. the hazelnut one wasn't good either. moral of the story: come here for tea and to do hw. go elsewhere if you want something beyond that.drinks: 4cleanliness: 4outlets: 4noise level: quietwhat a perfect study spot in the neighborhood of hyde park! came about 1-hr before closing and there was just 1 lady working. super quiet, plenty of tables both high and low, and large windows for natural light. it's located within a common building in the back/middle.would i come back? yes, perfect place to do work.it's a dollop so you essentially know what to expect.  like the other locations, the drinks are solid, albeit a tad overpriced, but certainly a better option than habitually burned coffee at large name brand corporate coffee shop.  (rhymes with barlucks).  i had a latte and then later cappuccino.  the latte was very good, they had the right balance of milk and didn't leave you feeling heavy.  the cappuccino was great as well and the perfect boost in the afternoon.as noted by some others this isn't the coziest of dollops.  it definitely has a bit of a colder industrial feel to it.  having said that, it's a large space in an area where the coffee shops tend to be a bit small and over crowded.  the plug situation needs some work and sometimes they've got the music cranked a little loud.not the best dollop location, but it'll do. i only like it because it's convenient and fairly spacious but otherwise i wouldn't come here. the seating isn't very comfortable and while there are outlets available, i feel like there aren't enough. the whole place gives a very "cold" feel. i usually prefer coffee shops that are more cozy and warm. there are definitely other dollop locations that have that nice ambience but i'm not quite sure what they were thinking with this one. there is a pretty good amount of space available and it is less crowded than some other cafes on campus, probably due to its tucked away location.this shop is located in a building on uc's campus. unless you are familiar with the northside of uc (smart museum, young building etc) you probably aren't going to find it.as with most dollops, speed isn't high on the list of priorities. true, everything is handcrafted, in true barista fashion only one drink is made at a time and there is (unimaginative) latte art created. so with that being said, if you are getting coffee/espresso on your way to class or a meeting, make sure you make time for the process. the decor is super industrial which is cute, but dollop still manages to have a messy lobby/cafe space. not sure if it's due to students studying or being lazy with their belongings, but it manages to look disheveled.also, the food for what you get is extremely over priced. there is a small reach in and panini press; it looks like everything is slapped together by hand, so maybe it's priced so high to dissuade people from ordering? i wish dollop would partner with goddess and the baker grocer for rte items and pastries. especially in this type of environment i would think that grab and go options would be super popular and efficient. but what do i know?all in all, it's a nice addition to uc and maybe hyde park (if they had the right signage).what a great coffee shop! large, well-lit, and airy, it has a lovely ambiance. seating was plentiful, as were outlets. wifi worked with no issues. the noise level was minimal but it didn't feel too quiet. i had an amazing sandwich and also a hot drink. both were tasty and not too expensive. the clientele is mostly uchicago students, so there's definitely a young vibe. everything was clean and tidy. the baristas were friendly as well. this is one of my new favorite places!i've been to a few dollops around chicago and this one is probably my least favorite. like any coffee shop, there's is some variance in quality based on who's making the drink, but this is the only dollop where i have felt like i was regularly overpaying for what i was getting. this location is regularly out of certain drinks and sometimes milk (almond, oat - although a lot of coffee shops struggle to keep oat milk in stock so this ones not their fault). i usually order a cappuccino and somehow the espresso often tastes burned and sometimes they don't froth the milk enough. my latest drink was almost at the same quality as mcdonalds or starbucks. the espresso was incredibly bitter/burnt tasting and the texture was too watery for a proper cappuccino.  i will say, for what is close to campus, this place is one of the best, but it is nowhere near the level of quality of most dollops or other similar chain coffee shops in the city (la colombe, intelligentsia).i would not recommend any espresso drinks from this location. i just ordered an iced mocha, the barista forgot about the shot (which was pulled into a milk pitcher???) while helping another customer, and then overpulled the second shot too. she filled the cup half with almond milk, filled the rest of the milk pitcher (containing the shot and the syrup) with almond milk, and then poured only half of the espresso/chocolate/milk mixture into my drink. so i received maybe a quarter-strength drink that i paid $6 for. i get that people are learning, but this poor girl was alone on shift and looked genuinely terrified by making this drink. there really should be a second employee on to train for the sake of both employee and the customer.its really a shame that i've had such poor service at this location (repeatedly) because i love the downtown dollop spots. unfortunately will not be returning for espresso any time soon.really love the space. was not as impressed with the latte, it didn't taste like coffee at all.great coffee and one of my favorite campus places. it's also a great place to do work or sit and talk. i also recommend the jammy hammy sandwich. food and drinks are a little on the pricey side but it's better than pret and the other places on campus (except maybe the grounds of being or plein air, but those places are often more crowded).also the music is usually on point.i use to really enjoy them when they opened but my past few experiences have been horrible. there is only one barista who actually knows how to make the drinks correctly (a black man with blonde hair) everyone else does a horrible job of it. i allows get the mexican mocha and it taste so watered down whenever other people make it. i don't think i'll be visiting this place anymore.wonderful addition to uchicago's north campus and a welcome gem to hyde park's already crowded cafe scene. but students can never have enough cafe options. because i woke mere steps away from this establishment i've grabbed coffee from here many times. their coffee is smooth and strong. i've also highly enjoyed their almond croissant which was flaky, buttery and creamy. i'm currently sipping on a lovely chocolate milk. this airy cafe with high windows allows for light to pour in and makes for a pleasant experience whether one is working, relaxing or just popped in for some hot cocoa. i'm happy to be a regular!visiting from cincinnati we asked for recommendations for a coffee house.  dollop was recommended as a good place.  pros: -very bright interior with large windows.-a few couches to sit in for relaxing with others while drinking coffee.cons: - music is distracting and not relaxing and kept going in and out.- pricy.  two iced coffees and one pastry was $13. - decor feels more like a cafeteria than a coffee shop.  wide open space with white bare walls with the occasional painted coffee related art on the walls.-outlets are literally falling off the wall leaving wiring exposed.much better place to work than starbucks down the street. usually pretty crowded with students, so be prepared to share a bench. tip: sit farther from the doors if you can -- they let in a nasty draft in the winter and there are 3 sets of them!coffee is a little pricey at $2+ for a small. the place gets quite packed with students. if you're looking for a place to sit down and work, they have a lot of seating options if they are not all already preoccupied. it is mostly bench-style seating where several (assumed) strangers share one table and bench. there are also small tables and bar-style seating available, but in smaller numbers. overall, if you're looking for a place to work, expect yourself to be kinda crammed in like a bunch of sardines. there is also a small area with sofas that are comfortable for small get-togethers if you wanted to chit-chat, but again, you have to be fortunate to get these seats if they are what you are looking for. the busy-ness gives the cafe a nice ambiance.awesome cafe! i ordered a coconut oolong tea and a snicker doodle cookie. both were excellent. barista was super nice.i am so glad this place has come to hyde park! it's got great american-style pastries, and the biscuits are really indulgently delicious. the coffee and tea options are broad and consistently good. i think it's a great place to work, with the big open windows and ample seating and plug points. the service has always been friendly.what a great addition to campus! finally a good coffee spot with ample seating and lots of sun light for those of us still stuck in school studying! coffee is great here as are the baked goods (made in house). the vibe is chill, good background white noise to study to. it's pretty quiet as well since everyone here is a student. you'll be seeing me here from now on when i need to get some sunlight and studying in!not worth it. super expensive iced coffee (maybe it was a cold brew) and it was way too strong and bitter, even after adding milk. i was really disappointed.got an almond croissant here. it was bomb. the almond cream had little almond skin flakes in it. i've never seen that before and it was great. the crust was beautifully crunchy and buttery. excellent croissant, dollop. i commend you. the space is surprisingly large and very brightly lit. despite all the students, i felt that it was reasonably quiet.this feels strange to say because i generally like open, well lit spaces, but for a coffee shop, dollop's huge windows felt a little strange. perhaps i am too used to the softly lit, cozy atmosphere that most coffee places go for. honestly, i need to go back here for coffee and update my review accordingly.relaxing environment to chill and get some work done! since it was uic finals week, got to take advantage of their bottomless coffee deal!so i've been coming here almost every day for the past few weeks to change up my studying environment. i love this place for a few reasons: it stays open until 10 pm, which is why i started coming here. most places close at 8 and 9 pm in this area. love the long picnic style tables, bright lighting, and open layout. the tables are great for group meetings and for people like me who just like to spread out with my books and laptop. the music here is great. sometimes it's a bit loud but never too intrusive. i love how they play artist's whole albums. i've discovered a few new people i like just from listening to the baristas picks for music each night.  the baristas are friendly and remember regulars even though this place is full of students every day. drinks are great and they usually do a little latte art on my cappuccinos which always brightens your day :)thank goodness, at last a bright spacious coffee house open late! rare on the southeast side.dollop is an awesome coffee shop north of campus and they have awesome customer service! they've got lots of seating so you don't have to worry about not having a place to enjoy your coffee or food. awesome music in the background gives it that classic coffee shop vibe that students will definitely enjoy to socialize and study in. it's great!hey! i love working out of your hyde park space. there's so much space and great wifi. everyone was so friendly even though i was making changes to my food (celiac struggles). do you per chance have a printer? i've been having to go to cafe 53 to get my prints.this place deserves all the hype it gets. i've been coming here almost daily since starting work down the street. i always order coffee black and the quality is stupendous. i've started getting the lunch recently and the big payback is delicious, not too much and reasonably priced. the staff is always friendly and parking is easy. ill keep on coming back so long as they keep on being awesome!really dug the decor and the coffee was excellent. the food looked good, though i didn't have anything. and the staff was quite friendly. i don't live close, but if i did, it's the kind of place that i would frequent. however, if i did frequent kusanya, it would be, without exception, with newspaper, magazine, or book in hand. here's the negative:normally in 2018, non-working wifi (unless it is a one-time, unforeseeable disruption, as can happen to any business) knocks a review down to one star. but these guys are a non-profit and doing good work, so there's no need to ding them. not for nothing, but they also have no reviews less than three stars, which is definitely something. still, after a twenty-mile or so, meandering bike ride through some nasty, nasty construction zones and streets (screw you, hyde park!!!) with kusanya as the ultimate goal, i can't say it didn't leave a bad taste when, after changing out of my sweat-soaked jersey, ordering a drink, settling in, and opening my laptop, i was treated to internet that wouldn't connect. hopefully they fix that with their provider.first i'd like to say thank you to kusanya for bringing such a super cool cafe to englewood. cafes like this are needed within the community. with that said this was my second time visiting the cafe i hav family nearby and it's great to have the option to get good food and coffee nearby. today i tried the oatmeal and it was really delicious not your traditional oatmeal it was baked oatmeal very yummy. i'll def be back and i'll get the oatmeal again. prices are good customer service is excellent and the food taste good also.i loved walking into this coffee shop. it's in a good location, easy parking, free wi-fi, and great food selection. the cafe space is very open and comfortable and the bar is nicely designed out of reclaimed wood and doors( i think).the staff is great, polite, funny, engaging and offering great service. the food coffee and music are all top notch and if your even think you want the baked oatmeal, do it, don't skimp on the warm cream.even though i was visiting from out of town, i felt welcome and like i was among friends. i can see why it's called "kusanya" - bring together in swahili.i am pleased with my visit here, very kind staff and great taste coffee options.  order a coffee to go and check out the sleeve: brewed in englewood. way better than that watered down crud starbucks sells. the atmosphere is usually very upbeat and trendy. a lot of vegan sandwich options, which is a bit problem for me!great place! saw this on a pbs special one night at work so me and my daughter checked it out. i had the big payback and my daughter had the bernie mac n cheese. excellent! she said it was the best thing she ever had which is a big deal for her. this place is a gem and i hope to see more pop up! will be coming back.i finally made out into this awesome space. tried before but my timing was off. they weren't open...well, today was a stumbled-upon kind of day.... so very happy i came! first visit... very awesome coffee! i mean deeelicious !! they said they roast their own beans in house!um... guess i never submitted first review... so... 2 weeks later i was wanting that delicious roasty flavor... got it for free! they have a pay-it-forward program! sometimes your drink is in the last person! it's  love! so, i bought a brownie.... just to taste & give away (diet), but bit they are really special brownies... wish wish wish i could inhale the whole gooey thing. don't must out on kusanya quiet spacious clean friendly chill deco goodthis place is lovely!  i came in with some coworkers and really enjoyed my iced caramel latte.  the prices are fair, the ambiance is comfy and inviting, and the staff is friendly.  i will certainly be back.the latte was almost as good as the service! the ladies were very friendly and helpful. the caramel latte i got was very flavorful and was perfectly crafted. i will be stopping here regularly. so refreshing to have a coffee shop in the area!this is the spot for me whenever i'm in the neighborhood. i had the baked oatmeal with fresh berries and almond milk and it was perfect, along with a latte. prices are so so extremely reasonable, and the bakery case has yummy items ranging from 90 cents to three bucks. i love the aesthetic here. they have beautiful art pieces and a rustic, hip feel to the general decor. the coffee is roasted and packaged on-site and also sold at the englewood whole foods. everything is top notch quality with choices of $1 mugs of coffee if you order it to stay. i love the nods to englewood throughout the cafe, from the outline of the neighborhood sketched on tables, to the coffee sleeves and paper bags. kusanya also hosts neighborhood events, a fresh foods night market on certain evenings, yoga on weekends, and open mic storytelling. kusanya is also a non-profit that started on kickstarter and that stays afloat through community support and grants. if you want to donate check them out online or stop by and ask about it. i look forward to trying their sandwiches! so so good!non-profit cafe, c'mon y'all, this is pretty cool.folks told me, yeah, don't go to the south side. i'm from oakland, and that's what people said about there too. it's kinda surreal here. this business should be supported!french toast is good, cafe au lait a bit burned, soup great, and the cornel west sandwich pretty boss!the barista said they have music here sometimes.i love this place. i come in once or twice a day. the quality of their coffee is beyond expectations. the other guys have nothing on them. the ambiance and decor are wonderful. cozy and inviting with a very friendly staff. this is not a "fast food" place. don't expect speedy service. expect great service. go kusanya!i was on a film shoot with my crew on the south side of chicago and we needed lunch and to setup shop for a little while to capture footage. we found kusanya café and it was great.staff was friendly, had some wifi for us to use, and the food was great. pro tip: get the chicken funkadelic. really delicious chicken salad, not smothered in mayo, with a little kick.wish there was one closer to me, i'd go frequently.great little gem of a coffee shop. incredible coffee and great food to boot. surprisingly great prices and very helpful staff. definitely will be back!rosa j. believes that every community deserves a inclusive, inviting, and "empowering" spot to hang out.  kusanya cafe is an englewood represent, located on the southeast corner of green and 69th. st.  i do have to admit the surroundings are a bit sketchy, even though i don't anticipate immediate danger during the daytime.  the cozy joint is absolutely nice to get coffee and light lunch fare at reasonable prices.  i saw many regulars take advantage of the free wifi and bright sunlight to get work done.  i had the "ham master jay" sandwich made-to-order by the friendly young lady at the register.  it was executed impeccably and tasted delicious.  together the large, 20oz. latte and the sandwich cost less than $10 after tax.  after visiting various coffee shops in the city, kusanya is one of the most inexpensive places i know.  if you happen to be the area or need to grab a quick bite nearby, kusanya is an excellent choice.  the nearest el station is the cta 63rd./halsted green line.  for cta buses, #8 (halsted) and #67 (67th./69th./71st.) are in close proximity.this place is beautiful. the food is good and the ambience is wonderful. friendly staff. nice place to read a book or get some work done.i was grateful to learn of this place.  the entire setting is well thought out!  i was also grateful that the staff janiece and lisa were excited and seemed to be empowered.  they believe in the product.  this place was awesome.this cafe is probably my favorite in all of chicago. the interior is beautifully decorated, the music they play is perfect to bop to, and the staff is incredibly gracious and kind. not only does this coffee shop support a great cause, the coffee is smooth and fruity, and i really appreciate how they encourage their customers to use reusable mugs with lower prices. the cornell west was balanced with the sharp pickle and the rich swiss cheese, and the chicken gumbo soup was comfort in a bowl. overall, i'm a big fan and i will for sure be back to study, to chill, or honestly whenever cause its just that type of unforgettable joint!my 1st time ever here! the neighborhood is rough. but the owner phil welcomed me. i welcome it. in fact try the chai and the ham master jay sandwich. so good! i'll definitely be coming back!kusanya is a hidden gem! the staff are welcoming, food is yummy & atmosphere is superb. we ordered the "bernie mac & cheese" sandwich with an old fashion + chocolate donut. all of our food was rich in flavor and tasted fresh. there's a lending library & they host community events. this is a cool addition to the neighborhood, i'll be back for sure.i love their coffee and sandwiches.  i work up an appetite when i roll dice with the guys on 71st and halstead.first let me start with the decor and ambiance of this place. it's so rustic! nice & cozy. something  that is well needed in englewood. you walk in to a warm, genuine greeting! nice, neo-soul music playing .... real dope! now the food...i ordered the chicken funkadelic wrap. it was really tasty. my only complaint was that it was a bit messy.... when you bite into it- sauce squirts out the wrap so i needed a lot of napkins!   i ended up needing a knife and fork. i would recommend that they use less sauce on the sandwich.  i paired it with a fruit smoothie that was delicious!  the customer service was truly refreshing.  i would definently return to try their breakfast....the owner is awesome and makes sure that everything in the restaurant is sustained from the community around it, from the employees to the art to the food. staff was very friendly. food takes about 10 minutes to come, but all the sandwiches are very excellent. can't go wrong. no wait at 11:30 on a weekday, before lunch rushnice cozy spot, great for a cup of coffee, the staff is super friendly and best part is very community- drivenhip little non-profit cafe in englewood, doing great things for the community. staff was extremely friendly and engaging. great decor, food that's good & reasonable. we got the lupe tabasco & a large coffee but fyi a large coffee is very large, basically a bowl lol, but there's nothing wrong with that!my daughter bought a pack of your ethiopian coffee for me yesterday.  it was so good that i read the menu, looked at the photos and now i'm hungry for their breakfast and lunch.  i will be there next weeki love everything about this place-- the food, the drinks, the staff, the style, the way the cafe strives to support its community... everything. delicious food and coffee drinks for less than you'll find them at other cafes, and the atmosphere is very relaxed and cozy. highly recommend!an oasis in a desert. do as i did and stop in and enjoy every bit of it. the food the coffee the ambiance. you won't walk away disappointed.i love the comfy coffeehouse ambiance, the friendly cute guy behind the counter, that it is in englewood, and the fact that it is community owned and run! they serve pretty much the gamut of coffee and tea offerings, as well as some unique breakfast items  (baked oatmeal, paninis, house-made granola), fruit smoothies, sandwiches, soups, salads, and baked goods. sandwiches  haves cutesy/kitschy names like mozz def, tuna turner, bernie mac & cheese, etc. the chicken funkadelic panini is delish and worthy of an encore! the blueberry muffin was moist, flavorful, and full of love. the chicken noodle soup will be remembered fondly until it is in season again.kusanya apparently means "to meet, or gather" in swahili, and kusanya cafe is providing a place for its patrons to do just that!ok so i live a few blocks from this cafe and every time i pass by i make a note to check it out. well, i finally made it and it was well worth the wait. the food is fantastic. i got the special: rasta jerk chicken wrap and it was great. it's got a well-needed kick. i also got a lemonade and some cookies and they hit the spot. the atmosphere is inviting and the service is fantastic. stop in, grab a sandwich, and chat with the employees. i will definitely be back to some of the community events they host!a wonderful place.  friendly people, great service, yummy yogurt parfait, excellent tea & coffee...and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to boot!there is no cafe that has done more for their community than kusanya. everything they do is above and beyond par, and done with love. a gem of an establishment. well worth the trip. go check them out, you'll be glad you did.one of my favorite spots in all of englewood! great coffee and even greater mission.  go and check them out!i am so glad i finally made it to this place! i tried a few different things: the chicken funkadelic sandwich, a lemonade and a peanut butter cookie. all were flavorful and incredibly affordable. i even got a bag of ground kusanya coffee to go! on top of all that, the staff was friendly and welcoming. i'm proud to have a place like this in my community. you should definitely check it out if you can.great food and atmosphere. clean restaurant upbeat employees. parking available. live/ radio music.i really liked the decor, the art work, and the build out with exposed brick of this place. it's great that they located in englewood, this space is needed there. ilike the pay it forward. as a vegan the menu was a challenge for me. my hot chocolate with soy milk was great though. free wifi, great space to get a little work done. it they had more vegan options i would increase the stars.nice little gem on the southside. really enjoy coming in here. the atmosphere is always welcoming and the sandwiches are good and the coffee is amazing. i never get a headache from drinking their cafe like that prestitution starbucks.  looking forward to our next visit.the warmest welcome i've ever had visiting a restaurant the food and the service was outstanding i couldn't ask for a better experience. this is totally a hitting gym in the middle of englewood. you totally escaped the surroundings once you're inside very lovely place :-)i love it here. the ambiance is dope and the people are extremely accommodating. i haven't any complaints. i've eaten here once (funkadelic chicken sandwich) and it was tasty. i also ordered a peanut butter cookie which was just okay. i highly recommend it as a place to visit. whether alone to chill, to study, or with a group of friends/colleagues.i found a gem in englewood. i love everything about this cafe. it's so cozy, the people are welcoming, the artistic atmosphere is attractive and it's such a great gathering place. i had an opportunity to have a very short conversation with i'm assuming one of the stakeholders or operators (who ever he is) but i learned that the cafe is a nonprofit organization and has no one person as the owner but the people of englewood are owners. love it. i'm a fan.  kusanya cafethis is an amazing spot to eat breakfast or lunch in englewood. i have been working in this community for 4 years and my co workers and i always come here first. most of the other food options are fast food and this place gives us an opportunity to eat fresh food. i love support local businesses! the staff are always friendly and it has a homey feel. the food is simple and good. awesome sandwich options and the prices are reasonable.the mocha that smoothed down my throat today was maybe the best coffee i have ever had, apart from a cup served to me in an ethiopian home a few years ago. coffee: a+ambience: a+customer service: a+and bonus points for loving the englewood neighborhood!i am headed back tomorrow.on tuesday i saw on facebook that a new coffee shop was opening in englewood.  yay.   i shared the info with friends.  saturday morning i hopped on a southbound redline to 69th.  while waiting for a westbound #67 bus i chatted with fellow commuters about how much faster the redline is running since the track improvements.i knew the cafe was in the next block when i jumped off at halsted and 69th.  instinctively i checked out the north side of the street for 825 w.  typical northsider mistake because on the south side odd numbers are on the south side of the street.  it's a lovely corner location with exposed brick walls and lots of big windows.there were a lot of people for 2 pm on a saturday afternoon.  a fellow patron approached me as i stepped up to place my order and "paid me forward $2." a very friendly ice breaker option.  of course i waited for the next person to pay them forward $2 as well.  i chose a hearty bowl of corn chowder because i was starving so i will have to check out the lattes next time i visit.  i told a friend that one of the sandwich options is a "tuna turner."  he laughed and suggested that they should offer an "ike tea" to go with it.nice place.  nice people.  happy to have a landing place when i'm visiting englewood.very nice and lively.  enjoyed the artistic touch.nice conference work table in the back.this is a great place to have a cup of coffee and read or study. it has a very homey vibe and the baristas are very welcoming. it's a great place to study with outlets on the couch and free wifi! their coffee is great! i got a chai tea latte with a shot of espresso and it was really good! i would definitely come back here and make it my go to study spots. they have a small selection of breakfast and lunch as well as pastries which make them an all around cafe. their prices are very reasonable.a coffee oasis in a desert of starbucks and dunkin donuts! mellow and welcoming vibe, industrial decor, great place to relax with a latte. took the recommendation of another yelper and was not disappointed: the mos def sandwich was super yummy. also, appreciated the books for kids on he bookshelf so our 5 and 3 year old could be occupied while we enjoyed the excellent latte. thank you!an englewood gem! outstanding service and great ambiance. i've tried almost all of the hot drinks and all were great. great prices and way better drinks than starbucks (which i do patronize often). fresh pastries and breakfast sandwiches served as well. cold pressed juices were phenomenal. if you're in the neighborhood you must stop by, or make a special trip and see for yourself.nice addition to neighborhood. coffees have great flavor- smooth without bitter aftertaste. they also have smoothies, sandwiches, salads and breakfast options. they also have yoga on monday evenings and host a variety of other community events including poetry readings, storytelling and music performances. love the pay it forward option.love this little cafe.  sandwiches are delicious, i will be visiting here on a regular basis.  only issue is there is only street parking and there are no other options besides sandwiches and wraps.  the day old donuts are even delicious.  glad to see a black owned business in this neighborhood that's not rundown or a liquor storei appreciate this place for being bold enough to be located in such community!! i did a counseling session here, that's how nice it is! i'll be back!;)this was one of the best tomato basil mozzarella sandwiches i have eaten in a long while. crisp bread, great balsamic vinegar dressing and fresh ingredients. my latte was also excellent - wonderfully made with very flavorful coffee. will be back again!awesome decor and comfortable feel! food service is extremely slow! super slow... smh... i guess thats why they have the books... speed up the food and its a five star for me!! oh food and drinks are good!my co-workers ordered from here a couple of times and i'm always impress. the sandwiches and soup are great! is a really nice place to have close to work. the prices are fair also.  i plan to stop there one day for a donut at breakfast time.wow, so good.  this place has great bbq chicken sandwich, fresh squeezed orange juice, and is a non profit.great place to eat and hang out! i had the barbecue chicken salad sandwich, i know sounds weird right? it was delicious! great atmosphere and it isn't simply an escape from the surround neighborhood but celebrates all that's good in the hood.what a nice place!!!!! everything i tried was really good.loooooved the baked oatmeal.you know they put in effort.their food and service reflects that.i wish them much success.i'll definetely return.wish there was a cafe like this by my house!!!! lolthis is a really nice cafe with a great vibe. the overall ambiance was great with the music in the background and the artistic look to the place with the seating. a variety of coffee, teas, and also some sandwiches, including french toast. i had the french toast which was delicious and the oj was freshly squeezed and just as delicious! quality service.i just can't find a better americano anywhere in the city. locally brewed in englewood.  the pay it forward for $2 is a beautiful system for paying for a strangers coffee that comes in after you. make sure you do that!the new local gem of englewood!! the iced chai was delicious! perfect balance of tea & milk. also yummy is the broccoli cheddar soup!! really a must!! the friendly service & relaxed ambiance, along with the healthy & trendy meal options will keep you going back for more!!!this is a great place. you can tell the owner really cares and isn't just trying to make money. their donuts are awesome and the green tea (raspberry green) is delicious. great music always playing and the baristas are friendly and welcoming. warm place with quality food and drink and good service. the owner came up with a pay it forward option. you can add a buck or two to your bill and then the next person that comes in gets a free drink. so cool to sit by the register and watch people be generous and other people receive!what a great place! they're owned by a non-profit organization and make the most delicious coffee.  i tried their iced decaf fully expecting the usual crap coffee that is decaf.  i had to ask twice if it was decaf because it was so delicious.  they use the espresso machine for decaf and it great addition.  the staff is super friendly and their day old donuts are cheaper but still amazing. i scarfed them down in a very unladylike fashion.the place was very quiet during my visit from about 2-6 and was perfect for me who just wanted a cafe to hang out and relax. since i was there for so long i ended up buying a large mocha, the bernie mac and cheese, the ham master and another large pineapple and mango smoothie. i usually don't like cold drinks much but the smoothie was really good and flavorful. the staff were very nice and left me to my own devices without leaving any hints that i had overstayed my welcome. the food was good and the place was clean and peaceful. i wish i stayed around the area because i would definitely make this my regular cafe if i did.i love local small businesses.  especially ones that are on the south side.  so today i woke up and my throat felt all closed up where i was having trouble swallowing.  i already work from home, so going to a coffee shop is no big deal in order to break of the monotony.  anyways, i could have gone to starbucks, but i already had this place bookmarked, and i had the time, so i packed up and headed over there.   this was around 7:30 am, so it wasn't too crowded.  i stayed about 2 hours working, but i also i wanna talk about the food.  well, i don't really drink coffee often, so i have no idea what to order.  but i did want some tea and i got a really big cup of green tea with honey in it.  and to tell the truth, my throat did start to open up when i left.  i also ended up getting some grits.  now grits aren't usually the type of food you find in a coffee shop, but given the reviews of this place, i had to try them out, and my grits were really good.  i had bacon and cheese in mine, and they really hit the spot.   prices are very good here as well.  my tea was only about $2 and my big bowl of cheesy bacon grits were like $3.  they also had donuts for like $1 each and day old donuts which were 2 for $1.  there were assorted muffins and sandwiches available as well.  also, this coffee shop is really nice looking.  but not in a starbucks type of way.  it's the type of vintage looking shop you'd expect to see up north or on the near west side.  i read it's a non-profit owner as well.  anyways, this won't be my last visit, as i plan to come back and try some other items on the menu.the service is warm, friendly and aims to please. the drink items are refreshing (my favorite is the dirty chai, which is house-made and mixed with a shot of espresso.) i also like the lemonade because it's fresh squeezed from real lemons. i am very glad this place is in my neighborhood. the people of englewood deserve a place where they can have good food and high quality service. the owner is intent on providing good service to any who comes in and it shows. yay, kusanya!so excited about kusanya! incredibly affordable and homey. yumscious fare and pleasant staff.free wifi, great homemade yogurt, excellent coffee and even better service!! kusanya is a real jewel in this community!!i like that this place exists and i truly hope that they thrive in this location. they serve bridgeport coffee and all the menu items are available all day. they have pastries and  sandwiches and a few other items. i decided on a coffee and a slice of chocolate cake.  phil was very nice (and  easy on the eyes if i do say so myself). it's just a cool place to sit and have coffee and maybe read the newspaper, whatever your fancy.  i plan to frequent it more once my schedule permits.this place is truly an oasis...creative, delicious, well-priced food with amazing staff, too!  i highly recommend it :)this place is dope!! great space, music, and decor, & apparently they have community yoga here too?? the staff people were all super nice. and their food is poppin too, i had the "chicken funkadelic" sandwich and the potato bacon soup and they were so good. bless u kusanya cafe. i'll definitely be back.after passing by this place several times i finally decided to stop in and wow!  i'm hooked for life.  on my first visit, i tried the ice mocha and lupe tabasco - hooked.  second visit a regular coffee and another lupe tobasco.  third visit, coffee and donut.  this is my morning spot from now on.  they even take phone orders so you can run in, get your grub, and keep it moving.  i'm so happy to see that the owners decided to locate their cafe here.  from the cars i see parked along the street, and the number of hipsters and police sipping lattes and eating oatmeal in the morning, i'm pretty sure they'll be around for many years to come.great coffee!!! a welcome treasure to....the gd motherland?! who would have thought?awesome decorum good prices and they are very kind.  their ingredients are fresh and delicious.i was at a meeting in englewood where sandwiches and salad were served. i almost didn't eat any, but the meeting dragged on. wow! where did these sandwiches come from? this is so far above the normal meeting fare that i ate more. i was delighted to learn they came from a restaurant in englewood. i tried the tomato basil mozzarella sandwich, bbq chicken salad sandwich, and a great salad with pecans and goat cheese. i will be ordering from kusanya whenever i can.what an oasis. such a positive space. delicious sandwiches. and try the homemade granola.great place! loved the vibe and menu options. definitely check it out!my friend and i came here for lunch on a friday. i have been to medici many many times as it's a classic for students at the university - it's located just two blocks from the main campus.i ordered the fresh mozz sandwich and cream of mushroom and spinach soup from their specials menu. the sandwich comes with a choice of thin-cut fries, potato chips, coleslaw, or potato salad, so i went with the coleslaw. they are very generous with their sides - you can tell from the photo how ginormous the portion of coleslaw is compared to the sandwich. i ended up having to take half the sandwich and some of coleslaw to-go - big portions means more leftovers!anyway, it's a great place for some hearty food. i advise against the sandwiches made with baguettes since my experience with the baguettes have been that they are always too hard/crunchy. popular at this establishment are their pizzas and milkshakes. i always come out feeling stuffed - so if you're looking for something light to eat perhaps the med is not for you.i think the cheese burgers are 10 out of 10! my whole family enjoyed our dinners! we're taking what's left home. that's how good it is! and graffiti on the table and walls and booths is allowed!- leif, age 7the space is really nice. the girl at the front desk really wasn't all that welcoming. we got a table upstairs which also has a patio for nice days. it's cozy upstairs. me and my cousin shared a barbecue pizza and a garbage burger. the pizza looked really good but could have used more barbecue sauce and seasoning, it was lacking flavor but it was better than the burger even though it was a little dry. the garbage burger came with pickles even though i said no pickles. i'm not sure what kind of bun they used but it was stiff and cold, i ended up eating the burger with the lettuce instead of he bread. again the burger didn't have any flavor so this place was definitely underwhelming.i can't believe i haven't written a review about my beloved bakery! i have been going here since middle school. back then i fell in love with their chocolate croissants and they're still yummy to this day. i really enjoy their coffee (hot and iced), and the americanos. i also appreciate that they offer soy milk at no extra charge. best of all of you buy 10 coffees and bring in the sleeves you get a free drink. sitting is limited unless it's summer when they have outdoor seating.fell in love after we ordered some pizza from here for a group event. decided to come to the actual location and wasn't disappointed either! definitely a good place to check out if you're in hyde park.they have a smaller take-out only cafe-type location that is just a few doors down from the restaurant. i love the super rustic feel of the place. they have these wooden booths and exposed brick walls which both gave a very loft-like cozy feel to the restaurant. really gives the place a nice charm, which really matters to me! there are a lot of families here and students as well which gives the place a nice buzz. i dislike going into a super empty restaurant. for two, we ordered a calamari appetizer and two personal sized pizzas, which was just enough food. i absolutely love their margherita pizza. we also got the roasted veggie pizza which was pretty delicious as well. i've also tried the bbq chicken pizza and the garbage pizza and those are yummy too! i'm not a big fan of goat cheese, but my friends have told me they like that one too. basically, you can't really go wrong with the pizza here. the bathroom situation is confusing! it's one door that leads to another room with a sink and separate men and ladies rooms on the side. i was hesitant to walk in out of fear that i would be walking in on someone or going into the wrong one but do not worry!ugh. i so don't like the med. people love to say it's a hyde park institution, but honestly, the food is so mediocre. i will say the med deli is pretty good for a quick sandwich to and from campus, but the sit-down options at the med are just so bleh. the grilled cheese, the quesadillas, pizza, etc. are just fine, and they end up being kind of expensive with tip and tax (easily a $15 meal.) i always say i'd rather spend the extra few dollars and get some pasta/pizza from nella. the milkshakes are good though, if you want a sugar bomb to treat yourself, and the patio upstairs in the summer is really a nice space.from walking in the door to when i got up from the booth to leave, i think i  must have aged 2 years. for an off night, i am not sure why the wait was close to 30-40 minutes for a party of 2. what is most frustrating is that we were quoted 15-20 minute wait. their patio and balcony seating were not open that night.even after being seated, we waited for 20 minutes before our waiter even came by our table at all. when he did make his first appearance, he had the exaggerated brow-wiping-looking-super-tired-from-how-busy-it-is thing going, which frankly made it slightly more irritating since now we were almost an hour committed at this place and i was only able to sip on some water. i had heard that the thin crust pizzas were awesome, and not being a fan of the chicago deep dish, i figured i would try the roasted veggies thin crust in personal pizza size. my sister got the smoky joe sandwich with fries. i will say that the portions are generous and i liked the shoe string fries on my sister's dish (but i guess who wouldn't). otherwise, i was super disappointed that my pizza was not thin crust at all, in fact, it was super bready and felt fairly flavorless. being fed up with our dinner experience, we went next door to their bakery to see if maybe grabbing a pastry after could salvage our impression of medici and of course since the whole dining experience took so long, they were sold out of most things in their case, so we left empty handed.we were working at 57th st art festival last sat & sun. i found here at deliciousness medici coffeehouse and bakery and got dirty spicy chai coffee, spinach and feta pastries, apple pastries, cinnamon rolls, chocolate chips pastries. all pastries were so yummy and rich tastes.big chunks of apples, spinach & feta cheese pastries so delicious and all pastries are good size. dirty spicy chai was tasty too. it was so helpful place to get any meals and close by our booth. i used restroom too. thanks i will try some more next visit!nice place for saturday brunch near the museum of science and industry and u chicago. choose either from the walk up bakery or the sit down restaurant next door. brunch options that we tried included the smoked salmon omelet, breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros. service was great . walked to the bakery next door and it looked great as well.came here for lunch on a saturday and were seated immediately. i ordered a cajun chicken pita sandwich, which was decent. i asked for potato salad as my side though and was given fries instead. the waitress quickly corrected the error and brought potato salad.overall, not much to say about this place. the food was average and the service was good. not really 5 star-worthy but nothing bad about the place eitheri want to like this place - working nearby it would be lovely to have great food here.  it's just uninspired, boring and without much life.  the vibe is great, i love in interior, staff is attentive and friendly.  maybe i am too much of a food snob - i'll admit that i am fairly harsh because i don't like going out to eat food that i could do a better job making at home, which is exactly how this felt.  on two occasions i ate here and neither meal was something i felt good paying for (tuna overcooked and dry, italian sandwich was ok at best). i'm sorry guys i know there is plenty of love from the students at uchicago and it seems like you are an institution, just was not for me.for sentimental reasons its definitely 4 stars and for its pastries. . . . but the food is just mediocre. this spot used to be a couple blocks down the road and was relocated to a much bigger venue. my dad came here with my mom while he was studying in college and living in chicago back in the 70's. i think he also took some of his students here when he was later a teacher. so it was a favorite spot. still charming as he had told us about it. for brunch i would definitely go the pastries or sweeter route instead of ordering eggs. the eggs benedict my dad ordered he said was just fine and well cooked. my smoked salmon omelette was pretty lack-luster. not a lot of cream cheese inside and raw onions and tomatoes. the eggs were kind of stiff and just didn't hold any fluff or flavor. the salmon wasn't too fresh and appealing. though, it did come with a potato hash on the side. kind of like scalloped potatoes that were super crispy. those were fantastic. also, the hard bagel i took to go and provided much happiness way later in the night. my brother's chocolate chip pancakes looked like heaven. we did however order a cinnamon roll to split and that was bomb. so good. still warm and gooey. it was everything. before we left we went next door to the take-out section for pastries and sandwiches and we ordered a bunch of stuff for a party. the fruit tarts, mini apple and pecan pies were a huge hit and tasted great. definitely stick to ordering all of their pastries. additional tip, i believe they are byob. it's advertised on the door even though i noticed brunch cocktails on the menu. maybe that's for lunch and dinner. they also have an outdoor upper terrace where my sister said she hung out once and had pizza and brought in her own wine to share with whoever the hell she was hanging out with (i'm going to assume some relative). thanks medici for staying open so many years though and i'm glad i got to experience something my parents were regulars at over 40 years ago.wow, this place is still goin' strong after all these years, just like me (on a good day).i hung out at the medici when i was a very young hippie chick.  we were either in old town or hyde park, cuz that's where hippies went.  to be with other hippies.  cuz nobody else liked us.  but we really liked each other. like we had a choice.  peace & love meant you liked everybody.  trippy.the medici reminded me of the sink in boulder, co, with all the carvings on tabletops & names/drawings on the walls.  we hippies were a creative bunch & we liked to leave our markings wherever we went.  kinda like dogs, but we had more hair.at the medici we drank coffee while having meaningful, heated conversations about political stuff.  oops...maybe nothing has changed.i didn't much like coffee then, but i drank it to be cool & to appear older.  i do remember eating medici food but not a lot.  hippies were skinny, didn't eat much due to no bread (money). no wonder our threads (clothes) were baggy.in co i recall we foraged for berries & edible green crap, and i remember eating macrobiotic birthday cake in boulder that tasted like sawdust.gifts for that cat's b-day consisted of fresh-picked field flowers or poems, because....no bread to buy anything.but back to chicago:  way back when, i thought of the medici as mainly a coffee house, not really a restaurant. there were no chain coffee shops back then - this is what a coffee shop was, often connected to a bookstore. hippies rapped (talked) a lot, read books & didn't eat.....wait....the current starbucks scene comes to mind.....far out, mani groove on small, independent businesses that stick around for 60+ years.  hangin' loose at the medici.  righteous.  outta sight.  can ya dig it?gotta split now.latermy fiancee and i love the food here, and hired medici to cater our wedding. without any explanation, less than two months before our wedding, they stopped responding to our emails and phone calls. now we're scrambling to find another caterer on very short notice. don't rely on medici to cater your special event-- you'll only end up wasting tons of time and adding unnecessary stress. this was a shameful way to treat a loyal customer.went with friends for dinner and had garbage, pan pizza for the 2nd time; it was very good warm--thick but good bread and lots of ingredients. the pepperoni was different & crispy good! they now have drinks! got a pretty good paloma that was a bit bitter from the grapefruit, but i balanced it out with lime and salt on the (b)rim. chill place for family or friends with great service--thoughtful but not too overbearing.while i enjoyed the food and atmosphere of medici i was put off by the price point. for my garbage burger aka a burger, cheddar, caramelized onions, bacon, and bbq sauce on a brioche bun with a side the cost was $17. what?! at 5 guys i can pay $8 for the double patty with the same amount of meat and toppings. the side options are cole slaw, potato salad, chips, or french fries. the cole slaw i got on the side was quite good, the cabbage was crisp and the dressing was not too mayonnaise-y and not too sweet, a surprisingly great cole slaw. the brioche bun is from the bakery portion of the restaurant, airy and light though not super buttery.my friend and i ordered inside at the cafe and then sat outside to wait for our food. it was our first time here and we got somewhat confused by the cafe vs restaurant portion of the establishment. from my understanding, the cafe serves at least partially the same food as the restaurant, but all to-go. our burgers were ready about ten minutes after ordering and the actual packaging of the to-go orders is quite effective, i wouldn't be concerned about carrying something from here to a class or form a twenty minute walk away. the outside eating area is quite nice, there are about eight tables of two and four tops surrounded by foliage.i stopped in on a saturday and although it was really busy, i was seated immediately and was served. i had a sandwich and my friend ordered a milkshake, which she really raved about. i think i would try this place again, they appeared to have a really good menu and i would like to try one of their pizzas.i really enjoyed this restaurant.  it's a great breakfast and lunch joint near the university campus.  it's got a total college vibe but i also saw a lot of locals.the garbage pizza was excellent, their sunday brunch eggs were fantastic.  the eggs weren't greasy, the bacon was good quality, even the potatoes had great flavor, i was impressed.  service was friendly but it was a little hectic.  our food did come quickly though.  a memorable breakfast/lunch spot.standard quality cafe in any college town. the garbage burger is a little bit messy and very soggy.after 2 years of my best friend telling me that this was her favorite pizza spot, i finally tried it with her!  when you go in, there's upstairs and downstairs. we sat downstairs in the wooden booths, which were super cozy! we took a while to decide what to order since i wanted to look over everything, so i'm really grateful for how patient the servers were!we ordered the 57th street salad and the personal sized garbage pizza. the salad include prosciutto, dried cranberries, romaine, with jalapeno orange dressing. we substituted the feta for mozzarella and took out the red onions. it sounds so simple, but it was so refreshing and made for a really nice appetizer. the dried cranberries and prosciutto made an excellent combination. i can't eat anything too spicy so i was a little nervous about the jalapeno being in the dressing, however it delivers just a slight kick that still made it enjoyable.  the garbage pizza comes with a whole bunch of meat. had to have the peppers and onions removed since i can't have them, but it didn't lack in flavor. the different types of meat also brought different textures, which was pleasant. we couldn't even finish the pizza, guess we had had too much bread prior. (they give you bread and butter before you even order!)i hate being the person that is so picky asking for things to be taken out or for substitutions, but it's dietary so i gotta! our server was really patient, reading over our order to make sure they got everything. they even made jokes with us about it, which made me feel a little less bad about making so many different requests. i thought my friend had overhyped this place, but i was really impressed and appreciated my time here. i can't wait to come back!!been here couple times. it's a small place with limited seating famous amongst the uc crowd out of a need for a café or just sentimental reasons. lines are long during peak hours but you can find a place to sit otherwise. i have seen delicious looking pastries but the only thing i've tried here is their coffee and mexican hot chocolate which was awesome. menu looks good, willing to try their breakfast sometime. for the neighborhood, i personally love hyde park. it has its own charm and feels distant from chicago in some aspects. you would have to spend some time looking for parking though since it's a busy stretch. overall, cute.this place near the university of chicago campus is a great lunch spot. the burgers are awesome. they have a fairly extensive menu. nice service and a pretty cool atmosphere as well.went to grab a late lunch here after spending the day at the museum of science and industry. there wasn't a long wait around 5 pm on a saturday as we were seated right away. the staff was friendly and the food was good and way cheaper than the museum cafeteria. the portion size was large as well."people let me tell you about the best place!"parking is a bit hard but you will always get a lucky park in the front. let's start by saying there's a rooftop! oh. even better?! byob. i usually get the pizza it's great i absolutely love this place and the customer service. they even have an ice cream shop/bakery next door. wonderful place to go with friends during summertime chi!i've been coming here since i was a little kid and not much has changed except maybe more graffiti on the tables and walls. neat atmosphere and there's a good mix between locals and college kids. the menu is straight forward with nothing too unusual. they are connected to their bakery and all of the bread is homemade. if you get a chance, check out their cinnamon rolls!went mid-day on sunday. everything went well. love the thin crust spinach, goat cheese pizza.updated review:     not much has changed with medici over the years, it's still hangover food that's right up your alley if you're a nearby student with a forgivable palate.    nestled in the heart of chicago's liberal hyde park, we dined here last night with renewed expectations, nothing new happened.   non-diverse wait staff were accommodating, but the goat cheese pizza was forgettable, so was the grilled tuna thingee.   nice place to chill and converse, just don't expect great tasting food.i live close by medici and am a repeat customer. it's one of hyde park's best breakfast spots, as you'll see by the lines if you go during peak times. despite being frequently busy, the service is always good, and the food usually comes out quickly. i always get the vegetable omelet and it's nothing revolutionary, just a good veggie omelet. the bread is made in-house and is delicious (all the baked goods i've ever tried are great). i've only ever had one bad meal here, and it was the salmon omelet. i will never order salmon from this place again, but everything else has been really good.i have eaten from the medici many times!!! this past saturday i ordered a thin crust family size garbage pizza and a himbersaft (sp) lemonade and had it delivered to my house. my delivery guys name was aurelio. he was warm, nice and professional. all of my children bumrushed the door and he was very warm and not pretentious with my children. keepauerelio!! he is a great addition to your staff! i had a great experience with him!!! the bell pepper on my garbage pizza wasn't cooked well enough for me. maybe if you guys sauté it lightly first then add it to the pizza like 5 mins before it's done. the crust was freaking amazing! i mean stellar!!!!!! my lemonade was delicious too! of course i will be back!! tell aurelio the lady who told him that she was going to yelp about his top notch service said hi!!!!the food and service here is good. nothing amazing, but it's one of the few places in hyde park where you can go out to eat with friends. it's usually crowded and doesn't take reservations, which can be annoying. but, the wait usually isn't long in any case. some comments on the food. the chili cheese fries are very good. the deep dish pizza with sun dried tomato and goat cheese is also tasty (although a bit oily). i'd skip the garbage burger though.quoting my niece "worst pizza ever!" resident of kenwood area for 18 years and have visited medici over the years. the quality of the pizza has gone down. i thought i would give it another chance. i gambled and lost. undercooked. asked to have it sent back and it was returned burnt at the top and still undercooked at the bottom. how does a place mess up a simple pepperoni pizza?!?!  why would you serve a burnt pizza?!?! never again. plenty of other restaurants who take pride in their food, their service, and know how to properly cook/make a pizza.an amazing menu and even more amazing food! the hummus was delicious and came with very fresh veggies and warm pita. i strongly recommend giving it a try.  my chicken salad croissant was the perfect blend of flavors and made fresh. the staff was very polite and attentive, my water glass was never empty! this is a place i would love to frequent.i had the literal worst chai latte of my entire life here last night. it was $4 and terrible. don't know why they think it's ok to serve such a bad drink. it was completely flavorless. it always upsets me when a place with a lot of business and experience is majorly lacking in areas-- especially when it's listed prominently on the menu! true north next store has way better drinks. been coming here my whole life and feel like it has gone downhill over the years. the sandwiches are great but everything else is sub par. it used to be my fav pizza ever but it's not what it used to bebaby friendly: 5 starskid friendly: 5 starswe eat here all the time (sometimes in the restaurant, sometimes at the bakery, sometimes take out).  we have tried most of the menu, and have come from brunch on the weekends early in the morning and later on, as well as weekday lunch, and weekday and weekend dinners.  it's busiest for brunch or lunch!  but they're always friendly and helpful.we love sitting on the patio upstairs.  it's really pretty!  we'll also sit on the patio in front of the bakery, because we can pull the stroller right up to the table easily.this place is very kid friendly. they have high chairs.  they let us bring our stroller upstairs to put on the patio with us, and also offered to let us keep it downstairs. this is super helpful. they were friendly to the baby. there were other tables with young children, and they all seemed happy and well treated.  there is a kids menu, and the kids we've come with enjoyed the kids food.  the handicap bathroom is big, has a sink and a koala care changing table in it. so either parent could change the baby's diaper! my favorite items are their breakfast foods, sandwiches, salads, and any baked goods.  my frequent orders:lemonade or strawberry or raspberry lemonade.  i love lemonade, and theirs is my favorite lemonade from anywhere.  it's frozen, so it's slushy like.  it's the perfect lemonade in every way.veggie omelet.  this is a great omelet, and it's packed full of veggies.  the potatoes that come with it are great.  i always get cinnamon raisin toast, it's fantastic.  sometimes i get a side of chicken sausages, they're great too.moroccan ragout.  this is kind of like a spicy lentil chili.  it's delicious, and very likely vegan.  it comes with pita bread and cucumber yogurt sauce.  it's not very big, but it's very tasty!house salad with balsamic pesto vinaigrette.  this is the best salad dressing in the world.  the house salad is fairly plain, but it's big and i love that dressing!  i frequently get this and the moroccan ragout.grilled cajun pita.  this is a wrap on a pita.  the grilled chicken is great.  the cucumber yogurt is great.  what's not to like?  it comes with fries.grilled chicken skewers.  the skewers and rice are very tasty.  there's not a lot of food, but it's all good.cajun turkey sandwich.  the medici bakes their own bread, and they make amazing bread.  that's what makes all of their sandwiches so good.  this is my favorite of their sandwiches.croissants.  they're all amazing.  my favorites are the chocolate and almond ones.  my coworkers love the ham & cheese.apple pie.  it's amazing.cinnamon raisin bread loafthings i don't like from medici:pizza, bbq chicken, fettuccine alfredo, fries (to be fair the fries aren't bad.  they're just plain, and not interesting.  they're kinda like burger king fries.  whereas i like mcdonald's fries).long time i've eaten food from medici but never ordered on my own. it's great! the food is not why the rating is low. the service was. i ordered over the phone a napoli sub-very delicious, fresh- is listed online as served with my choice of several sides, with fries being the default. i was not given fries with my sub. i go back and am told "only if you ask". okay, cool, i'm asking now, while i'm still in the store. fries are 1.29 as a side with the sandwich, yet 2.99, over 3$ as an individual side. i was told they would "have to" charge me the full 3$, even though i just bought a sub and the appropriate measure is to just do a price adjustment. and the team members i spoke with seemed to not care that i was clearly dissatisfied with my experience, and were very dismissive, telling me to "move" so other customers could order since i "wasn't willing to pay" for the fries. ridiculous, seeing as i would not have asked for the fries if i didn't want to pay for them. i left upset and ate my delicious sub but that experience alone-first impressions are important- leaves me unwilling to ever spend money there again. tldr; great food, rude staffour family had lunch here when we visited chicago in july, 2018.  i had a version of a chicago dog, my kids had garbage burgers, and my husband had a fried chicken dish.  all of us enjoyed our food.  i especially liked the atmosphere at medici; it is a fun casual place.this place was part of my childhood, adolescence and even my adult years!  what started as hans morsbach's little coffee shop in the late 50s and has grown through a couple of relocations (that i know of - maybe they are on location #4 or more?) and is a staple of what was my hyde park experience of the 70s and 80s.  somehow the current incarnation has preserved enough of the vibe of the last place - further east on 57th - that it still feels familiar.they still make an awesome deep dish pizza!  they still make an amazing eggs benedict!  somehow, the notion of all you care to squeeze oj has even survived to this day.go check them out - anyone who grew up in the neighborhood will tell you the same thing - the med is a great place to eat, sit, chat, and generally unwind.impossible burger, delicious fries, and other vegan options. they also let you create your own pizza, thin crust or pan, with vegan cheese if you want. food came out very quickly.came for brunch and boy were they busy! this restaurant has a very homey feel and charm. their booths can be a bit snug so i prefer to sit at the tables. service here is excellent and the food comes out very quickly during brunch. the omelettes come with potatoes and choice of bread. it was one of the most filling brunches i've ever had and everything was delicious. the ingredients for the omelettes are not mixed with the eggs, but folded into the middle. they did not skimp at all and it was a super large omelette that i had difficulty finishing. the only downside to their brunch menu is that they lack a variety of menu options that pairs savory with sweet. you can get a single stack of pancakes but not sure it could apply to the specialty pancakes or french toast. for those who want a little sweet and a little savory, this menu is a bit limitation. for those who are no fuss and want more traditional, delicious brunch, this is the place to go!came here with my bf for the first time. service was friendly and all of our food came on time. we shared the salmon burger, goat cheese pizza, almond croissant, regular croissants and two teas. to be honest the croissants were the star of the meal. everything else just seemed a bit bland. the salmon burger tasted really under-seasoned,  and was just masked by the chipotle mayo. the pizza was cooked perfectly, but lacking the taste. if you like cheese you may love it. the goat cheese was good, but just seemed like it needed something. so three stars for the food not for the service. i would give the service a 4.5.the med is one of those restaurants that you never really go out of your way to go to, but it's there and convenient, especially for many uchicago students.  it's a popular meeting spot/catching up spot, and the bakery is great as an option for easy take out.  they also have outdoor seating so when the weather warms up, it's actually really nice to hang out with friends at the patio.the bakery portion of the med is great, minus the occasional long lines and the wait time for your drinks to be prepared.  it's even better knowing that if you come an hour before they close, they sell all baked goods 50% off.  i've tried multiple things from the med, and definitely, the fruit tart is one of my favorites (although i may be biased because i love fruits tarts of any form).  the fruits are made fresh, and often, they put a nice peach or apricot glaze over the tart.  the filling is the perfect amount of sweet and creamy and the crust is a little hard.  i actually had trouble breaking apart the fruit tart to share and the med bakery portion unfortunately does not have any harder utensils than flimsy plastic knives and forks so my friend and i spent maybe 5 minutes sawing away at the tart (which may be the only downfall).  but it's not as if the hardness takes away from the taste--i think it makes it taste better.  i just wish the med had less flimsy material to eat the fruit tarts with.  the shakes are another thing i highly recommend--especially, it is worth checking out what the special is as they change often (if you come around autumn, they have an amazing pumpkin pie shake that is to die for).  overall, the bakery of the med gets about 4/5 stars in my book.the reason as to why i give the med, overall, 3 stars is because of the restaurant portion.   the food service can be slow at times, and the food is mediocre at best for the price your paying.  whereas i highly recommend the bakery portion, the restaurant portion isn't necessarily a "must-go".  while the portion sizes are decent and will fill you up, the quality is alright and nothing amazing or special about it.  the main attraction to the med is the shakes anyways and you can just get that at the bakery next door.i've been to medici four times. i want to like it. badly. but despite the hype, history, and heralded grilled cheese, it's barely three stars in my mind.first visit:the cafe side. grilled cheese sandwich. veeeeery greeeeasy. meh. second visit:dine in. super cool upstairs seating. loved the atmosphere. my vegetable soup though? blah. my boyfriend's lasagna didn't wow me either.third visit:takeout. salad with bleu cheese and pesto dressing. i felt really queasy afterward, and i'm not saying it was the food but... fourth visit:takeout. salad with bleu cheese and pesto dressing. guy at the register was an asshole who made me feel like shit for asking if the salad came with bread. it did. it tasted pretty good. but then i had to lie on the ground because my stomach cramped up. fifth visit:breakfast with friends. i got an okay omelette.medici on 57th: pretty dope hyde park landmark but disappointing foodie destinationwent here on a saturday for brunch with my best friend! i ordered the eggs benedict and she had the the breakfast #2.  my nest friend loved hers as i'm sure anyone who pours a half container of syrup would. (sigh) as for my benedict's, and i like to think of myself as a connoisseur of benedict's as it is my all time favorite breakfast/ brunch dish solely for the hollandaise sauce was cold. my sauce was cold and hand no taste whatsoever. the bacon was cold, the eggs were cold and the muffin was cold. in fact the only thing that was near hot was the potatoes which were delish by the way. overall i loved my meal i just wish it had come to my table hot and i also wish that my holly actually taste like hollandaise and not just bland tasteless yellow sauce to pour over my benedict.  verdict: i would return. just make it hot next time.i've eaten here quite a few times in the last 4 or 5 years and have never had a disappointing meal! their menu is diverse, with plenty of options, the service is fast and friendly, and the restaurant itself is lovely in appearance and ambiance (peep the occasionally turning statue high up there).i've eaten so many meals here, but i'll try to remember the very best items i've had. it's been years and i still think about the goat cheese dip in marinara sauce. we loved it so much - we were even dipping our fries in it by the end of the meal. the sandwich with cheese, arugula, and fig spread is also fantastic, though the bread is a bit tough. for breakfast, i love their eggs benedict, and definitely recommend that you ask for your potatoes crispy! this is a wonderful, family friendly restaurant with great service and a menu that could please anyone!place is amazing! i can tell why president obama loved it so. unique feel and atmosphere the moment you walk in. great vibes all around. food is plentiful. day time servers always recommend the best dishes! a great little secret to the hyde park community. it's definitely worth checking out!old neighborhood staple.. i grew up in hyde patk so i have been coming here off and on for years. the food is average.. it's mostly frequented by the locals and students from the nearby university. the pizzas are decent... today i had a blt with avocado nothing special, but hard to mess up too.we lived in hyde park for a decade and this was definitely one of our favorite local eateries. "the med" has a long history in hyde park. the atmosphere is very fun, with graffiti all over the walls and tables as well as some cool original art (including pieces by matisse and other renowned artists). the food is fairly standard american fair, but a couple of items are exceptional, especially their milk shakes. my favorites are the mocha and the banana nut fudge. they also have a great cobb salad and decent brunch options. in the summer, they open their second floor patio, which is one of the only quite outdoor seating areas in the neighborhood. just before we left, they also got their liquor license, and they now have a great selection of craft beers. we're missing having this restaurant as a nearby place to walk to now that we're no longer in the neighborhood.this by far is my favorite place to have breakfast while in chicago! their breakfast is amazing, i'll be dreaming about it from california. their muffins are so good, i don't even have words to describe how amazing they taste.i think former president obama ate here?this is a pretty decent cafe, with pretty typical cafe options - burgers, sandwiches and personal pizzas.  i really like the personal pizzas - the garbage pizza (i.e. the meat lovers pizza) is simple, tasty and packed with meat.  my wife had the spinach goat cheese pizza which was tasty too.  the pizzas take a little bit of time to make but the restaurant is all and all pretty efficient.  i also tried a smoky joe wrap - which was fine, but just.. not that exciting.  i would come here for the pizzas.the strawberry shake is the only thing i can review.  it is one of my favorite shakes.  i want to try the pastries specifically the spinach & feta but they are always sold out when i arrive.this breakfast was disgusting. i had scrambled eggs with vegetables, and my friend had a make your own omelette. i don't know if the vegetables were frozen then cooked, but it was i think one of the most horrendous looking soggy eggs i've ever seen in my life. the omelette looked like pre-made eggs unfolded and stuffed with microwave vegetables.these photos are so gross i would consider them nsfw.my wife went to medici when she lived in hyde park as a little girl. she insisted we had to eat here on our visit to chicago. she told me that it had only changed in small ways. what i found was an excellent neighborhood pizzeria.the neighborhood is full of families and at 11:30 on a sunday morning, we saw a lot of families getting brunch or lunch, plus some students rolling out for breakfast. medici felt like a family place. the host complimented my watch and we talked watches as he walked us to our table. the waiter was attentive and friendly, happy to offer to wrap our leftovers and generally nice. this is very much a family restaurant.the decor is one of a kind. a giant wooden bishop greets you as you walk in. gargoyles loom from the second floor balcony. the tables and walls are covered in writing from past patrons. somehow, it doesn't feel grimy, it feels lived in. deep wood tables and trim with brick walls don't feel so heavy with the high ceiling dining room. i don't often write about decor, but at medici, it's part of the charm.we each had pan pizza. my wife got basil and sausage and i got the recommended garbage pie. i'm not an expert on chicago style pizza, so i can't compare it with that genre, but from somebody who lived and worked in new york for 25 years, it's good pizza. the crust is thick like you want it to be, but it didn't feel like a bomb in my stomach like deep dish pizza can. a little bit less dense crust makes it more enjoyable. the meats make for a greasy pizza, but in a good way, like you would want with a hangover or in the middle of the night. the garbage pizza has ground beef, pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and green peppers. somehow, it all balances together. this is not sophisticated pizza. it is not gourmet. it is hang out with your friends pizza and it hits that spot well. better than a lot of new york places-- but not all new york places!my only small criticism is the bathroom. you go into a small room with toilets on several sides, both men and ladies. there is only one sink. this can make for a bit of waiting to wash your hands. the pizza is good comfort food. the decor is lots of fun. the friendly family environment is relaxing. i was leaning toward 4 stars for the food, but the vibe made it 5 stars.ate here the other night. ordered a turkey burger with fries and a salad with pesto balsamic salad dressing. both were really good. the burger was pretty big and had nice flavor. the french fries also had really good flavor. we really enjoyed the salad with the pesto balsamic dressing. the service was really nice and the restaurant had a nice ambiance as well.visited once with coworkers during lunch time on the weekend & i already know i'll be back several more times. this restaurant had a bunch of traditional american options like wraps, shakes, burgers, sandwiches, and pizza. i had the grilled cajun chicken pita and it was delicious and fresh. the fries are just okay here-too thin for my liking.i'll be back to try the pizza options. service was good despite it being really busy and reasonable prices.i'd recommend this place.this was my first visit and i came here with a group of about 10 people for brunch. the wait staff were great they were able to get us a place on the roof top quickly. they were quick to get our orders in and get us our food everyone enjoyed all of their dishes. we were there for brunch so we ate mostly after breakfast menu and i was impressed with the variety. was a great place i'd love to come back here again next time i visit chicago. i love the name and the aesthetic,it was very funky.best custard tarts in the entire city by far no one else compares! they sale our fast tho, perfectly sweet and fruity.this is my go to restaurant in hyde park.  good quality ingredients, fresh, tasty salads, excellent baked goods.  one caveat - almost all their soups are so spicy i can't eat them.  just got the garbanzo spinach for carryout and could not eat it.  doused with hot sauce and red peppers, it's heartburn city for me.  ease up on the unnecessary soup spicy heat, medici!  too much heat kills the flavor anyway.visited twice and hated my food the second visit.  it's a cute little place, but the two pastries we had were hard as a rock and stale.  the apple pie dough had to be stabbed through to open up.  the tart dough was similarly hard enough that the knife could barely cut through.  it was almost comical--two people having to chisel through their pastries.  they seem to focus on sandwiches here--a pity, because their pastries look great but were less than desirable.the fruit tart is amazing. the fruits were fresh, the cream was delicious, and the crust was good but on the thicker side. i also ate the moroccan ragout, salad with pesto vinaigrette, and lemonade. all were delicious and came out quickly. there are two seating areas, upstairs is less busy. so i'm not entirely sure why we had to wait to be seated since there were lots of empty tables.the medici is another restaurant that has meant a few different things to me. growing up in hyde park, the med was a safe haven. my best friend and i would while away nightly hours drinking coffee and plotting our eventual world domination. much like the neighborhood in which it is situated, the restaurant space is quite versatile. the booths are cozy and the coffee is good... presenting the perfect spot for catching up, there are larger tables for groups, as well as an upstairs area with adjoining outdoor roof patio. in the last few years, the medici expanded, and now has an attached cafe and grade level patios for dining alfresco. the food is solid, and the prices are reasonable. the med has the best burgers in hyde park. i took dates there in my youth and was always impressed if they could take down a whole medici burger. the pizza's are good...no deep dish, but pan or thin crust usually does the trick. i also enjoy the grilled skewers and italian sub sandwich. they used to serve pretty decent loaded baked potato, but it is conspicuously absent from the current menu. the milkshakes are stellar and the fresh squeezed lemonade and orange juice are tasty... i think the oj may only be for breakfast or weekend brunch, though.the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. the wooden tables, booths and bare brick walls are laden with carved inscriptions of years gone by. so many etchings surround you in certain seated areas, that it's indistinguishable from a designed pattern. i'm certain that somewhere amongst these carved memorials is a reference or two to my own youthful indiscretions. this is not to say that the medici doesn't have a more casual side. i have met there for business lunches (midday parking there can be a pain) and more... "adult" dates. at last count, they don't even charge a corking fee and are byob. the versatility of the spot is made apparent in it's space, and anchored by the terrific food. the service can be a bit gruff sometimes. most institutions within college towns tend to become insular, and i believe the medici suffers from this. come to the med for the burger or pizza. meet there with a friend, a flame or fellow foodie. enjoy the coffee and drinks, or bring something harder with you. if you're in hyde park, it's difficult to go wrong at the medici.growing up in hyde park meant lots of visits to medici bakery/restaurant for their delicious pastries and pizza. this place used to be awesome! the only reason i'm giving it an extra star is bc of nostalgia...but unfortunately, the quality has gone way down. while visiting my parents over the weekend, we swung by for a croissant and were shocked at how terrible it turned out to be! the croissant was so greasy - like soaked. i couldn't eat it as seeing the amount of grease made me sick. i understand that croissants should be buttery... but they should not be wet. when i went back to exchange (perhaps it was just this one croissant?) the manager was so rude! she said nothing to me. nothing at all. she grabbed my bag of grease and walked away. one of the employees were nice enough to help me out and exchange my croissant for another. unfortunately, it was just as greasy.went back the next day to try a sandwich. we waited almost 30 minutes for a mozzarella sandwich! and everyone was incredibly rude to us when we asked about it i care about hyde park and the community - which is why i feel so bummed that these places are getting lazy. seems like they no longer care about the quality of the food/service.i live on the north side of the city but decided one day to venture to hyde park and experience a different neighborhood. i took myself here alone on a weekday for lunch before doing some more exploring. i found the menu to be extensive and a good value for the quality of food. the staff was very efficient but not overly friendly, which is why i deducted a star. i was not thanked after paying the check or when i walked out the door. still, i would consider returning if i was in the area.the food here is great. but customer service is lacking. i was told to call back closer to 11am to schedule a lunch order because they are too busy dealing with the morning rush.  i work at the university of chicago, we don't have a lot of options for good affordable delivery. i just called and placed my order because like i said i don't have many options in the area. something tells me i won't be getting my food within the hour either. i'm just really disappointed.awesome almond croissant, feta cheese pastry, cinnamon roll, and brownie. have to try their milkshakes, and garbage pizza. bakery is the best. hits the sweet spot!!!only great w thin crust pizza and desserts.food: cheese pizza 5, veggie chili 3,  rueben 3, bacon cheeseburger 3, onion rings 3, banana pudding 5, pecan pie 5, mixed berry pie 5service: 3ambience: 4cleanliness: 4cute little restaurant with good food. we had a pepperoni pizza, a spinach and goat cheese pizza and the garbage can burger. all was very good but the spinach and goat cheese pizza was the best--it had pesto and was sooo good we almost finished the whole thing. definitely a great place to stop when you're in hyde park!i've been eating here off and on my whole sort of grown life, back in the mid-1980s my world revolved around this place. all my friends worked or ate here. i lived with a waitress i met here delivering pizza and quarter ounce bags of weed at night when i finished my day job turning wrenches on stony island ave. after hours we all hung out together. the garage we raced motorcycles out of was in the alley behind the current location. when it moved almost every tradesman that built the new location was a friend of mine. it had great food back then and that's still the case. this place has the best pan pizza and burgers on the southside of chicago. the bakery and the deserts are pretty awesome, check out their shakes or a vaguely reminiscent for starters, and i love the way their coffee tastes. they make a mean eggs benedict most mornings. the medici is the kind of place you can carve your initials into the booths or the tables and nobody minds but the place is still well lit and clean and the staff is almost always cool, even when it gets busy. i've been away from this neighborhood for a lifetime but every time i return for a visit this place always makes me feel like home. if you are on the southside it's worth the stop for a meal for sure.i enjoy and praise almost every item on their menu in this iconic bakery in hyde park. when i get a break from class, i usually head here to fill up with all my dietary needs before heading back to class. one of my favorite pizza's here is the "spinach goat cheese with canadian bacon" pizza.i love the interior space of this eclectic eatery. very good breakfast, decent brunch and lunch. i have heard they are applying for a liquor license so there is a possibility of good draft beer or wine soon.so i was looking for a brownie fix. paid $4.42 for a brownie, that due to its price, i thought had to be one of the best brownies ever. not so much. the edges up to about an inch was so dry. the interior was more moist, but the taste level was just alright. definitely not worth $4.42. this is a good thing, i don't need delicious brownies this close to him.what you're really paying for is the place's atmosphere and environment. it's conveniently located in the heart of hyde park. however, the pasta i had was mediocre. the mexican hot chocolate was great though! cool placeparfait and brunch are very good! to be honest, dinner and lunch is just okay.... not too much options.environment is cute thoughnice american food, very big portions, very filling. most of us didn't even finish our meals here! the burgers were nice, but the pesto pasta tasted like takeout chinese somehow. anyway, the waiters were very friendly and attentive. nice place to unwind with friends.the only thing i get at the cafe is their milkshake - the fall pumpkin pie flavor is the best with actual pie chunks. sadly my lactose intolerance won't let me finish an entire milkshake now.the restaurant is generally very crowded all day long. i like going for brunch to get the smoked salmon omelet or their oatmeal with fresh fruit toppings. these are my "worth-it" items. i'm not a fan of the prix fixe entrees. the burgers are alone enough to fill a person without the extra sides - it just ups the price. the burgers are eaten with a fork and knife since they're so hefty - at which it's more like eating a steak with a bun around it.the service was better than expected based on previous reviews. i wasn't adventurous with menu selection but the quesadillas were enjoyable. i will come back again. it seems to be a good neighborhood spotbest black bean burger i've ever had. i cannot emphasize how friggin' delicious it was. and it wasn't even that pricy. it came out to about $13 with tip, but i can see how it can add up, especially if you also buy a drink. our waitress was polite, but not smothering, and the nice man refiling our waters was extremely attentive. if you're in the area, you should really try medici's. they even have vegan pizza. and the ambience of the restaurant is great (at around 3pm, i saw that they were putting out those faux led candles at every table which i thought was cute. must be for dinner hours).my food came stacked in a bowl...the one you see in the pic...how can anyone mess up shoe string fries.??? cooked 2x before serving them to me.  wow cole slaw was missing and my guys pizza was bland.  can i have my money back please!went to eat pizza here after a date at msi, and it was a wonderful ambiance. went on a thursday late afternoon, so it wasn't crowded at all. we had a goat cheese and spinach pizza, and got a cheese pizza to go. prompt and fast service. the food itself was phenomenal. you could taste the quality of the cheese, and the crust itself was tasty. i normally don't eat the crust, so it was a surprise to me and my partner. it has nice memories too because his parents ate there on dates when they had first met at u of c. definitely recommend the pizza. my only regret is it isn't closer to meme and my girlfriend came here when we went on vacation to chicago. came in on a sunday afternoon with about half of the place filled. waited about 10 minuets for a server after the host took us to our seat. he was very rude and did not care that we were there. we told him we were visiting and we wanted a good chicago pizza and he just said get any of them. there's like 20 pizzas on the menu. we got the garbage or trash pizza i forget the name. it was amazing. but the server really ruined it. he didn't rush us but didn't attend to anything. not even the bill. +food+atmosphere +host staff-serverracist staff and management alert.  specifically the server named irma and her immediate manager, a very rude and detached caucasian woman whose name i cannot recall.  i was a loyal customer to medici that loved their food and had enjoyed many positive experiences with various servers leading up to the unfortunate experience and assault from irma.  after receiving poor customer service from irma on one particular day that resulted in me asking to speak to her manager, irma basically approached me in a threatening manner as if she was initiating a fight.  i kid you not.  one of her co-workers literally had to restrain her as she had clearly snapped and lost her mind.  the female manager finally arrived and after explaining what transpired, there was no outrage she simply offered me half off my food.  a complete and utter insult.  let me not forget to mention that i am positive irma had one of her friends in the kitchen that prepared my meal to do something bad to alter my food it as i threw up later that day.  an experience i will never forget, nor overlook.  beware.i couldn't help, but give this place 5. consistently great pizza after years of dining with them. good ingredients + very light crust = job security for my trainer.they just can't keep a good streak going. i'm constantly ordering for delivery and i always order the same thing. spinach/goat cheese pizza and brownie sundae. sometimes they send the sundae with the ice cream in a separate cup (you know...the only way that makes sense), but the last time they sent the sundae made already and the ice cream was melted. i was forced to eat the sundae first before what was left of the ice cream got warm. this time i asked for the ice cream to be in a cup explaining that it was melted last time. "that will be $1 extra charge".  why?!! you're already charging a delivery fee. that doesn't cover the costs of delivering my damn ice cream in scoops rather than liquid form?! why offer it as a delivery item then? why not raise the price of the damn sundae if you can't afford the costs to deliver it properly? sigh. i needed an excuse to cut another restaurant out of the rotation. the food (most of what i've tried)is decent but their service is often lackluster, delivery or eating in, and i can't take another issue with them.great food and service, and i love the spin on classic favorites! the milkshakes are to die for, and the brunch is the ideal weekend comfort food.last night a friend and i were going to court theater and she was running latei put in a thin crust pizza to be ready by 6:30 and that's exactly when my friend arrived and voila the pizza was delicious! after the play, we went to the bakery for lattes. i have a concert at the logan center tonight and.enjoyed our dinner so much, i'm heading back there for dinner.this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in the city. from the cool, yet relaxed ambiance to the chai lattes to the spinach and goat cheese pizza and steak sandwiches to the friendly service - medici is one of my go to restaurants for group dinners. the shakes are great as well, and the bread from their bakery next door to the restaurant is divine. highly recommend it!five stars because medici is a hp classic. the menu is way too long. stick with what they do best: cesar salad, pizza, calzones and milk shakes won't disappoint.this isn't pizza - (i got thin crust not pan pizza) it's like golden brown but not charred anywhere, it tastes like it was just baked in a regular oven like you would have at home, the (mozzarella and parmesan) cheese tastes cheap - other stuff i've had here isn't bad but the pizza sucks - it's super bland, like i don't know if they just don't put salt in anything or what, it's like bizarre i've never been so dissatisfied by pizza. the dough seems like not a pizza dough but some kind of other pastry dough. i asked for some olive oil to perk it up a bit but they only had cooking not finishing oil. i don't know why there's so much basil on it but it's still super bland? there's tomato wedges on top of the pizza but like the toppings are under the cheese and there doesn't seem to be much of them there? i just don't get it. sorry y'all i'm just a little italian boy that wanted to eat pizza and now i'm just sad. they put topping under the cheese it's just super weird. i thought pizza was like, medici's thing, but i guess they just have their own weird pizza style. also their thin crust isn't thin tbh it's just normal. i'm so vexed rn. their pastries and sandwiches are good idk why their pizza is missing the mark croissants are way more difficult to make! they comped it which i really appreciated, no problems with service. this is a rating for the pizza only. i don't even write yelp reviews but the people must know.pasta took 30 min to make, tasted worse than frozen pasta i'd bought at the grocery store.i can't believe it took me this long to visit this hyde park institution! thank you, daphne l. for the recommendation. walking in to be seated at a cozy booth with graffiti walls, students, professors, and medici regulars made me feel at home. the menu here is big, and so much looks good, but we opted for breakfast. i got the huevos rancheros and their lemonade which is made like a slush spritzer, very refreshing. the huevos were great, service is hard working, and i can't wait to get back to hyde park and to medici.good but not great brunch on a sunday morning while visiting a u chicago relative. upstairs had a nice feel with high open ceiling and a view out the back to the outdoor patio. service was good to take our order quickly and the food for 5 arrived in pretty short order and came out hot so no cold eggs and toast. the poached eggs were done almost to perfection, hash browns more like fried potatoes so would have liked a little crispier, huevos rancheros were excellent, corn beef hash was decent but not great. only thing i would say was not so good was the chicken sausage; it was $1 upcharge for 3 very small links and while the flavor was ok, they were very dry. canadian bacon and bacon much better. had to track down our waitress to get a coffee refill. 18% automatic tip for party of 5.for more than a decade the medici has been my favorite bakery, brunch, and salad place in chicago. all the croissants are amazing-- from sweet to savory--and the coffee is tasty too. the garbage salad is simple, yet amazing in terms of the balance and combination of ingredients. the challah french toast and sweet potato pancakes are not to be missed. the pizzas are pretty good, too. a south side staple, well worth the drive from all corners of the chicago area-- and a stop by those who are passing through.a solid staple of the uchicago student diet.  medici is close and convenient to campus, will deliver and can also cater.  but because it's so convenient it can get busy, so avoid the sit-down section during lunch time (unless you have time to spare).  it has a small bakery which is open early and late, so it can always work in a pinch.the food it hit or miss.  the pepperoni pizza is great, with nice large pepperonis and a good fluffy crust.  it also reheats well in a microwave.  the chili burger is a bit disappointing since the chili doesn't have any interesting flavor (and the rest of the burger doesn't either).  the cinnamon roll french toast is tasty, but comes with only a few pieces, not enough to fill me up.  the napoli and italian subs are both solid, although the bread can be a bit tough sometimes.i have had breakfast only here but the food and service are usually always good.they have blueberry pancakes on sunday only. this is a waffle free location so stay away waffle lovers!only bad thing is typical bad hyde park parking and parking meters that are way too expensive during the day.ableist, discriminatory, jerks!!!my friends and i frequently go to medici, but never again. my dear friend has cp and is in a motorized wheel chair. he's been there dozens of times both in his chair or using his crutches. tonight, he went to the restaurant and was treated horribly. the restaurant was busy and instead of making space for him inside, they made him wait outside. after the 10 minutes that they predicted, he checked in to see how much longer the wait would be. he was then told that since he couldn't sit in a booth, they couldn't say how long it would be for him to get a table or if he would get a table at all. since when is it ok to say that to someone?! i'm furious. to be honest, the last few trips to medici have left us unsatisfied and sometimes angry. bad service, crappy food, etc. well, now i'm glad we have a concrete reason to never, ever go back. i suggest you don't either.there was a time before yelp i might have given this place 4 stars. on my last visit i ordered a cup of beef chili and a tuna melt. weird combo, i know. i was craving both. the chili was very tomato-y and short on beef. it was served with a pack oyster crackers, nothing else. i didn't know i had to ask for cheese and sour cream and onions ??  the wait staff should ask. so i asked for cheese and sour cream. i got a slice of cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  so of course the cheese didn't melt into the chili. anyway when they brought the tuna melt it really wasn't. it was a slightly toasted tuna sandwich. when i asked about technique they said they said they run the bread through a toaster. hunh? that's not a tuna melt. overall disappointing for me. my mom enjoyed her chicken soup.came here after this place was referred to by a friend! when walking in we had very high hopes of a great meal! we placed our order with our server (a heavyset african-american woman) who was not very personable. . our food came out, a steak sandwich and chicken strips. the steak sandwich was ok, but the chicken strips and barbecue sauce were delicious! i was looking for our waitress for a refill on my drink... especially since sandwich and chicken tenders were spicy! i could not locate her. my water was also gone too! luckily the waterboy came over quite often to refill my water.... and somehow brought me out a refill of my ice tea! props to him... for being so attentive who was not even our waiter. we still couldn't locate our waitress and we had asked the waterboy for our bill. i wish the tip could have went to him. good food bad service.... not sure if i will be going back. enjoy your holidays everyone!there is corn syrup in everything -- find an item on the menu that has no corn syrup.  most places are phasing out the sugar for sugar alternatives like honey, maple, or coconut sugar, and this joke of a restaurant cannot even serve a burger without mainlining nastiness into your veins.university of chicago staple, which can be good or bad depending on the type of experience you want.  it's a very unique place in terms of decor, and i'm not even quite sure how to describe it.  they're very laid back, which is fine by me, although sometimes i think that leads to service being a bit on the slow side.  the food is delicious, and reasonably-priced too.  i typically get their personal pizzas when i'm there because they're so good, and recently i was there for brunch for the first time and got the sweet potato pancakes which were good as well.note: this place has two entrances, the west door takes you into the sit down restaurant, the east door takes you to the cafe/bakery area (where you can get sandwiches/bakery/deli type fare to go).it can get pretty packed, especially when the university is in session, but if you don't mind a bit of a wait it's worth it.pizza was pretty good. didn't take long to receive. free condiments and water station was available. service, however, could be better. front counter guys seem not terribly concerned about diners.i went to college in hyde park, so i've been a med customer for over 25 years. kinda crazy really that it's been a quarter of a century! so needless to say i have a sentimental attachment to this place. i probably ate the ~$5 (!) garbage pizza for saturday night dinner at least half of all saturday nights for four years.that said, i tried a med burger again after a while, seeking its former magic. i was disappointed. seeking something warm and juicy on this cold december day, instead i received a warmish burger topped with cold bleu cheese and cold grilled onions. the onions should have been hot, the burger just steaming of the grill, both melting the bleu cheese. next time, i'll remind myself not to order the burger (which is what i promised myself the last two times i was here).otherwise the fries were hot and the service great.this is probably one of my favorite places to do work on campus. they have such a good selection of drinks and food. their hot chocolate is amazing! my fiancé got an espresso which he liked as well. they also have a wide range of pastries as well as separate breakfast and lunch menus. the prices here may seem expensive for hyde park but they're nothing compared to the prices we have downtown! i loved the mascarpone stuffed french toast! it was such a good mix of creamy mascarpone and blueberry sauce. absolutely delightful! the biscuit breakfast sandwich was also good but paled in comparison to the french toast. there is seating indoors and outdoors, although it was a bit crowded (sunday morning). it was quite chilly when i was there but some people had to sit outside due to lack of seating inside. there are outlets through the seating area. i love the large windows that give plenty of natural light to the space. i'll have to go at lunch time next time to try out their lunch menu!the mascarpone stuffed french toast was amazing!  to be honest, i wasn't a big fan of french toast. but i fell in love with their blueberry mascarpone stuffed brioche french toast!  the refreshing blueberry sauce and the delicious mascarpone taste like a perfect harmony. it took awhile for them to make the french toast. i was almost late waiting for it, since i woke up kind of late that day. but it was totally worth the wait! i'm craving for their french toast right now! i'm back in la right now. really miss uchicago! enjoy while you can ! i also loved the environment! i really like the seats both inside and outside with little green plants! the sunshine and plants makes a perfect start of a day! taking away all me stress and replacing it with dangerous positive energy! plein air cafe motivated me to get up to study there, before i go to class, while enjoying a cup of latte. the raspberry beignet was delightful and refreshing, when i don't feel like too much sweet or cheesy things.*** workspace ***being a cafe in a university compound, there is plenty of seats with equal amount of outlets. however, this also means that it's quite crowded and stays bustling through the week.*** coffee ***solid selection of coffee that can be brewed in several methods. i always go for the cold brew or the drip.*** food ***snag a hazelnut beignet when you can! you won't regret it. i also love the pie here and for lunch option, the prosciutto with sweet balsamic sandwich is my go-to.*** ambiance ***adorably quaint! from the white interior to the outdoor seating surrounding a beautiful flower bed. if your scandinavian grandmother decided to open a modernize yet charming cafe, it'll come out resembling plen air cafe.food: 4service: 4cleanliness: 4noise level: quiethidden within uofc campus you'll find this cozy cafe offering bowls and sandwiches. perfect place for a quick stop in or study sesh at individual or communal tables. you get a rustic meets european vibe by the decor. there is also a patio on warm mornings! being here definitely takes you away from the city life.tuna salad sandwich: all sandwiches come with a side of simple salad tossed in a balsalmic vinegrette. the sandwich itself was super filling. tuna salad tasted homemade and not doused in mayonnaise. very light ! street parking out front.wifi works great.outlets along walls.would i come back? yestwo cafes in one morning, my goodness! but after finding  a good tea for myself we were on a quest to find a coffee worth it's wait for the coffee lovers in our family. this place was another yelp find and the yelp gods did not disappoint. plein air cafe & eatery had so much character and their menu of not just drinks but food were to die for. they had everything from croissants and danishes to fresh salads and sandwiches, everybody was able to find something to cater to their tastebuds here.i don't know if being close to a university helps but service here too was immaculate. and the croissants were out of this world.i like plein air cafe and eatery. i really do. the kitchen turns out simple, yet tasty food. the biscuits and housemade jams are exceptional. baristas pull espresso shots with the best of them and the mochas are delicious. i've missed on a few food items, but overall they serve above average cafe, breakfast and brunch options.my main gripe is the dining area service. it's kind of odd because the cashier counter is always friendly. they're patient even when the line winds out of the door. my problem is with the table bussers. each time i've been they've removed either a plate, cup or menu without uttering a single word. it's so shocking and quick that i've barely been able to get their attention to return. it would be nice if they'd ask before swiping my grub or anything else sitting in front of me. .. especially frustrating because the food is a bit overpriced.beautiful little cafe on a more beautiful campus right next door to the robie house!  who cares what the food tastes like right?  i wouldn't expect to stop here for lunch with the family and sit down at a table/ not happening!  packed all the time with students with their macbook pro's opened up next to iphones & cups of coffee i think is the best description.  i mean i'm all about technology but what about an actual conversation?  as far as the food goes... i feel like the sandwiches always sound better in description than they actually taste/ lots of bread.  the bowls on the other hand are excellent!! (chicken jalapeno bowl)  the menu in pretty extensive given the size of this joint & they offer breakfast items until 12; sandwiches & bowls, etc after that.  they have great coffee and all kinds of espresso drinks as well as some very good dessert items...including beignets!!  prices a tad on the high side but as far as hyde park goes this is your best bet by far for lunch, trust me.  not sure what others are talking about but the staff was very nice, probably the owner at the register even facilitating orders to customers!  talk laterplein air is a great surprise on a beautiful campus. though the front area is currently under construction, walking into the cafe (the cafe is on the right, the bookstore on the left) i was immediately struck by how bright, clean, and modern the place is. it's not super large and the majority of the seating is at long tables or a long bar overlooking robie house next door. i wouldn't say the place is especially kid friendly, because most of the seating is at bar style stools or chairs and i didn't see any high chairs around. however, if you came at an off peak time and could sit at a table it would be a great place for a kid.the menu is pretty extensive, note that they stop serving the plein bowls and tartines after 3 pm.i love that they serve topo chico, i don't see that much outside of texas. they also have fresh squeezed grapefruit and orange juice in their cooler.i was hungry, but not for a full blown meal so i got the soup of the day, tomato basil. i was very disappointed by the quality of the tomato basil soup, it tasted like they opened a bottle of tomato sauce from the store and poured it into a bowl. furthermore, the soup itself wasn't even hot, it was tepid at best even though it took the employees about 10 minutes to bring it to me. the french bread on the side was also stale. i really enjoy tomato basil soup, but there was absolutely no complexity or dimension to the soup, i didn't taste any basil, just cold tomatoes. it was $5.50 for the bowl and $3 for the large mug of breakfast tea i got on the side. the tea was strong and served in a big mug, though i wish the server asked if i wanted room for cream as it was filled almost completely to the brim. this seems primarily a place for uchicago students and faculty to study and socialize, light music played in the background, but the place never got loud. i will definitely be coming back, but i can see how it's easy to spend quite a bit of money quickly here, everything looks very good!they also do to-go food and drinks and i thought it was cool that they have a coat rack at the entrance for backpacks and coats. smart idea when winter hits the windy city!so many memories coming back to hyde park.  i graduated from the university of chicago in 2010, and since graduation, i've been living in texas.  for the holidays this year, i came back to chicago. i decided to go to the plein air cafe & eatery with my best friend and visit the college.i love the atmosphere here.  there's a lot of natural lighting.  love the wooden tables.  the place is small and intimate, and it has a lot of character and charm.   the best part was seeing people with philosophy books.  my friend had drip coffee, and i had the cafe au lait with extra coconut milk.  the coffee was, however, a little too strong for me.   plein air is still a great cafe.i had a really pleasant visit here. in a city that suffers bitter cold much of the year i can't imagine a better oasis than this outdoor eating section. i had the root veggie quiche. i'm not a vegetarian but it was seriously so satisfying. protein from the eggs, carbs from the potatoes,  and a green salad on the side. i also had an espresso which was good too.love this place! i frequent plein air quite often for lunch as it is one of my favorite places in all of hyde park. this cafe is quite aesthetically pleasing. in the warmer seasons, it's lovely to sit outside right next to frank lloyd wright's robie house and eat at one of plein aire's rustic tables. the service is always quick and attentive and the self-serve sparking water is a huge plus.my favorite items are the steak bowl, sweet pepper baguette, and hazelnut beignet. the steak bowl reminds me a lot of a filipino menudo dish, which i absolutely love. while the sweet pepper baguette is my favorite, the baguette itself is always pretty hard. the beignet is very good, but may be too sweet for some. be warned: lunch rush is real and you may be standing around waiting for a spot for a while.cute cafe in hyde park. street parking but it's tight. it has an indoor and outdoor area. trendy ambiance. mostly students from university of chicago. ordered some omelette, and it had fresh tomatoes and veggies! it was really yummy. cold brew is unsweetened but sugar and creamer are available.beautiful, bright atmosphere, peaceful crowd, good food! i am a regular for the play-it-safe tuna sandwich with fresh spring greens, soup du jour and latte. what can i say? i am just very comfortable coming here, sitting in or outdoors, and connecting to the wifi (high speed).favorite place in hyde park. definitely a spot i wish there were more like. every food item i've had has been superb! bonus: they sell metric coffee here which is my favorite! get the hazelnut beignets! service is great, space is wonderful but surrounding area is currently under construction. overall: a must try.cute place to study, but i had so many issues here that i had to leave. first, the girl who took my order was quite rude and had a terrible attitude. second, there aren't too many plugs so i had to wait around until one opened up. third, the wifi would not work and so i had to get up and move to another cafe/coffee shop to get my work done. and the worker who i had asked the wifi from was rude and quick with his response. fourth, food and drinks are expensive and wasn't even the best of quality. watery latte and an okay burrito. not coming back here when i'm in chicago.my dad (an ostentatious marooner if ever there was one) has been dragging me to this mediocre pit for years. i suppose he wants a bitter pour-over to match our mutual feeling and conversation. my advice: steer clear unless your bag is shabby-chic humanities graduate students preeningly leafing through drivel.we purchased a large order of items to try out and one item was lost in translation. they did all they could to immediately fix the issue. sometimes things happen and that's life. how a business responds communicates a lot to customers. we will keep coming back.great drip coffee (i'm a coffee consultant and was super pleased). great pastries. great space. the campus is lucky to have them.this cafe is a beautiful spot to study, work or just chill.  yes, it can feel a bit pricey, but the space and food/drink quality make it worth it for me.  i'm a big fan of their cranberry spelt scone, all of their lunch bowls (try the balti bowl!) and the loose leaf tea options (blend 333 = soothing herbal tea with peppermint and chamomile).  the chicken that you can add to salads is a little too intensely marinated for my taste, but i am eager to try more of their sandwiches, pies and pastries.the university of chicago is beautiful-even it's local restaurants. this one in particular looks like the designers from anthropologie designed it themselves. i only wish that the food tasted as good as it looked. i got a turkey sandwich, which is one of the most popular and a dirty chai. the turkey sandwich was dry, despite its contents. it tasted healthy, but i've had healthier sandwiches that tasted better. my mouth dried up so quick, i immediately got up for water. if you like chai from almost any other coffee shop in chicago, from the coffee and tea exchange to places like panera and starbucks- this isn't the chai for you. it flavor is so subtle it minus well not exist. it's not sweet, and if you add espresso the espresso is so bold it's overwhelming.came here on my trip to chicago in december and must say that this little cafe is the place to be if you want a good cup of joe! it's decorated minimally but tastefully. it seemed to be quite busy when i arrived there at about 11am, so try to grab a seat as quickly as possible to ensure you have a spot to sit. i had ordered the mascarpone stuffed brioche french toast with a vanilla latte, and sweet lord did those hit the spot after walking in the blistering cold, which i'm sure wasn't that cold but coming from texas, anything less than 60 degrees is cold to us...anyway, the french toast was sweet but not overly sweet, which was great because if it had been, rip me as i had paired that with the latte. it was also filling, so i wasn't dying trying to find another place to snack at while doing touristy stuff. the latte was probably one of my favorite lattes i have had in a while as it was perfected with enough cream and sugar to keep my sugar tooth satisfied. cute, quaint, and packed with delicious finds; y'all gotta check it out!lovely spot for a bite, good cup of coffee and to hang out in a chill atmosphere. large windows overlook a garden space with outdoor seating.  the garden borders the back of frank lloyd weights robie house. tasty, simple, interesting menu. you order the food yourself then it is brought to you at your table. they don't bring the coffee, not sure what's up with that so you need to know to hover around the coffee pick up counter until the coffee with name pasted on it appears.great spot and people working there.i like the food here although it's expensive, and unlike other reviewers, i think the wait staff is very friendly and cool. recently though, they've taken to forcing people to come in to order before they get settled in a seat. when this has happened to me, there has been ample seating and once the manager was very rude to me about it. i spend tons of money here so it feels particularly annoying and misguided on their part-- i'm not here to freeload a seat, i want food and drink. sure, if someone is sitting down without ordering for an extended time and there's no seats, fine, but forcing a menu on someone who says they don't need it and will be in line to order soon, seems more like a good way to lose a regular customer rather than a smart business strategy.i had the two egg any style breakfast and it was the perfect size and fairly priced. the iced coffee was a large glass and very tasty! service was great, inside and outside seating. cute little place-would recommend.ice mocha was excellent, the environment is really lovely and peaceful. though they close early (accustomed to california's cafes which close at midnight).this cafe attempts to provide interesting breakfast selections, pastry, and quality coffee in an aesthetic setting just north of frank lloyd wright's robie house bordering u. of chicago's main campus.   while the breakfast selections are above average in imagination and they purport to take pride in their coffee, the execution is lacking. the first tip-off was that my drip coffee was not sufficiently hot and my partner's latte was lacking in coffee flavor.  the omelet i ordered was properly cooked in a frittata style, but the accompanying red potatoes were underdone.  my partner had asked for eggs over hard.  oddly, while the two eggs on her plate appeared to have been cooked in the same pan, one of them was correctly hard and the other was still runny.  she experienced the same issue with her side of potatoes as i did.  her order also include veggie sausage patties which were properly cooked with surprisingly good texture and flavor.all in all, while plein aire cafe has laudable ambitions, they did not hit the mark for us this morning.i'm hooked.... this place is truly as good as it gets for coffee and cafe food, but at the same time, the place is absolutely packed all the time and the coffee drinks are priced like the premium coffee drinks they are. i love the yogurt and granola - it comes with super thick greek style yogurt, housemade granola, a ton of berries, a homemade strawberry compote, and banana slices. it's delicious, filling, and totally instagram-able. i've had dirty chais here on a couple of occasions and they have really hit the perfect balance of sweet and spicy with their chai!however, heed my warning - it is super easy to spend $20 here on a fancy coffee and lunch - that being said most menu items are around $9... but then you get a $5.50 coffee drink and decide that croissant looks ambrosial... and you've spent way more than you intended and you still haven't figured out where you're going to sit because it's packed.great coffee, environment, and food. definitely give their sandwiches a try. their kale and mushroom pie was also great.this review is solely for the mushroom pie. because that's all i've ever tried here. it is so hearty and filling. definitely worth the ~$12.  it's great that it's so close to so many buildings on campus. i also heard that their coffee is good, but i'm not enough of a coffee aficionado to walk over just for a different coffee when we have coffee in the building.fantastic spot! the spot is beautifully laid out, i love the walk up counter, the crowd is a good mix of students, young professionals, and older crowd. the decor is chic. i had the soy milk latte. they have the pacific barista blend which works beautifully, would give it a 3.5/5. the chocolate croissant was fantastic, 3.5/5 and can use some heating before they serve it but the chocolate hazelnut poundcake takes the cake, no pun intended 4.5/5. it is soft, crumbly, nutty, and baked extremely well.don't come here for a casual hangout with friends because you will not find space, and you will not be able to hear yourself think over the truly horrendous music. that being said, the coffee, pastries, and salad are great despite being overpriced. check out nearby sanctuary cafe for a better ambience and qualityi feel smarter just being there. hot fresh beignets and great coffee all together in chicago, are you kidding me? too bad the valet parking is always full.  enjoy!beautiful cafe with a great relaxed/serene atmosphere located on the university of chicago campus. delicious drinks and the food looks great as well. menu looks quite diverse for a cafe.  love the fact they provide free still, sparking, or cold water fresh out of a tap that's easily accessible to customers.the hot chocolate was delicious - not overly heavy nor did it taste like pure milk. just perfect. chai latte was also great. would order both of those again. wifi is free for non-uchicago students, though took awhile to connect to it. ask the barista for the password. great place to grab a drink before heading to the library or even to stay and to study.nice ambience. food is pricey but tasty. only complaint is it's kind of small and the tables are close together so it feels sometimes like you are sharing a table with total strangers.this is the pretty spot in hyde park. i usually go to their for breakfast. i love the royal pie spinach and the blue berry french toast. i usually order the blueberry danish ( absolutely delicious) for the coffee it's very strong for me.  (personal) so i didn't order every time. about theirs decoration i really really love it. it is the cutest place in hyde park. so we can drink coffee and eat in the cutes place. love it !!i love plein air. food and coffee are delicious, the service at the counter can be excellent. except when it's weird, which is not rare. for just one example, recently i was told that the coffee i ordered "for here" couldn't be served in a coffee mug because it would crack the cup because it's too hot.... in all my years of both being a passive aggressive barista myself (so no judgement) and dealing with them, that's a new one on me: a coffee cup that's too hot for coffee.... k..... also getting tired of increasingly paltry sides of room temperature home fries. plein air used to be better about this. sad because they're so so good when they're good.i want to love plein air but honestly, i don't.  the staff at the cash register seem bored & are consistently rude, quality is inconsistent (my most recent meal was cold), and often it's so crowded you can't get a seat! on the positive, the bussers are always friendly, the quality of food is very high and the location is great.  if only it was more welcoming and inviting! :-/good brunch place but definitely over pricednice coffee and tea good environmentstaff are friendly next by a nice bookstore, which is the best!i go to plein air almost everyday because it's definitely one of the best cafes that i've ever been to in my life. their latte, pastries and biscuit are absolutely amazing; other dishes are also very tasty. it also has a nice study vibe, having a little bit of a buzz but not noisy at all. a perfect place to grab a quick lunch with friend, go on a date or have some alone time and treat yourself.plain air is one of my favorite places to stop for breakfast. the exterior seating is lovely and the interior is light and airy. all of their pastries and quiches are fantastic, and i also really enjoy the biscuit breakfast sandwich. very good coffee and tea options. it's really a gem in the neighborhood.glad that they were open during construction. i was in the area and wanted to stop in for a beverage and sweet treat. i would have preferred to dine in but the way the seating was set up there was no room for me so i just kept it moving up lake shore drive.the mf bomb diggity! scrumdiddlyupsious! my love stopped to bring me some breakfast because i wasn't feeling well. i feel like a million bucks chuck! i had the croissant with egg thick cut xtra smokey bacon with monchego cheese and home fries! get you some! fye bo!this is a lovely cafe on the university of chicago campus, in the same building as the revered seminary co-op bookstore. the coffee and espresso drinks are great, the food is delicious with many menu options, and the space is designed beautifully to showcase the view of frank lloyd wright's robie house next door.on past trips back to the university i've kind of stuck to my old haunts (plein air wasn't open yet while i was in college), but this time i gave it a try and i'm so glad i did. my vanilla latté was perfect - not too sweet. i also got a sandwich that was a lunch special - chicken with poblano peppers, avocado, and beans on a french roll. absolutely delicious. it was a tad messy to eat, but so yummy. the sandwiches also come with a small serving of fresh salad with a simple vinaigrette, which is nice.i enjoyed my sandwich while listening to the fascinating discussions other patrons were having and enjoying the view out the enormous windows. had this cafe been open when i was a student, i think i would have come to work here quite a bit. it's just a really nice atmosphere and the food and drink offerings are on point and beautifully presented. next time i'll arrive earlier in the morning and try the intercontinental breakfast!this is by far the best coffee in hyde park. delicious macchiatos and cappuccinos that are smooth and not overly foamy (which can be hard to find in this part of chicago). all the food that i've tried has been wonderful. especially their ham and cheese sandwich! such quality.i have a mild love affair with the spinach breakfast pie here. the coffee isn't bad either. can get very busy, with little elbow room to worksubtle but modern coffee shop inside of a bookstore. enough space to sit down and chat. very nice and quick service. had a very soothing and perfect latte with homemade vanilla flavoring. i look forward to going back and trying more items.terrible customer service. when i was given the wrong drink and had to return to the cafe, i was told i would have to wait until there were no other customers until my drink would be remade. i was also told that taking the drink was my fault and that if i wanted my drink sooner that i would have to tell everyone in line that i was inconveniencing them because of my mistake. when i said that was poor customer service, i was told to take it up with management, but the barista could not produce a manager or management's contact information.  have never experienced customer service this poor.a great little cafe and only a short walk from the harper center. i visited here in july when classes are out of session and there were few vacancies both inside and outside. i can only imagine how popular this place is during school year. from the interior, i really liked their minimalist design and communal tables to make good use of space. we sat outside as the weather was perfect. the shades of tree and the overall enclosure made it a great spot for staying cool and away from the foot traffic on the street. unfortunately, my visit was short so i can't comment on their breakfast and lunch menu, but i highly recommend here if you are looking to grab a personalized cup of coffee (yes, come with latte art !!). i did notice that they have drip coffee as well.this place is aesthetically pleasing and the drinks are pretty good. i got two eggs any style and was not very impressed by the taste or the portion--just very mediocre for the price. however i ordered the chai latte and that was reallllllly good. just the perfect amount of spice and creaminess and foamed milk that i love in a chai latte. and the price for it was much more worth than its starbucks counterpart. basically, go there to have a coffee chat but not to eat a meal!this was the first wave of those restaurants with the industrial metal decor and wood benches and rustic coffee equipment and succulent plant decor and that classic multi-grain, locally grown, organic, vegan, humanitarian food. the balti bowl is excellent; everything else is over-priced.i love how tucked away this little cafe is. the space is charming and the food is high quality. the last time i was there service was a bit chaotic, but they made up for making mistakes on our order by giving us extra food. it is nice to take a walk around the university of chicago when you are done with your breakfast.i love the intimate atmosphere of this place! wonderful sandwiches, delicious brioche french toast (my favorite) and creative and wonderful coffee drinks. great place to study!a great find on-campus! this cafe offers many unique sandwiches, all of which are paired with fresh greens. this place was packed during lunch; luckily, i was able to find a seat at the window-bar. overall, delicious!this is a perfect little lunch spot, nestled in beside the bookstore, it offers an interesting & varied menu.we had sandwiches which were delicious, one was a turkey-brie-mustard combo & the other parma ham-manchego-alioi. both were very tasty. the only reason it doesn't get the full 5 is the order process. you've to queue up, take a ticket & find seating. it was a saturday & a bit crowded.overall definitely worth a visit for a tasty luncheon treat!plein air is lovely and makes possible my favorite paired activity -- bookstore and cafe. do be warned - seating is tight (especially in winter) and at peak times, it can be super crowded.  but never fear, the seating turns over quickly, and then you can turn your attention to your divine sandwich. extra points for the chocolate chip brioche which is a masterpiece.oh trevor you fool, what took you so long to come here?  having been in awe of pretty instagram photos for a while, and i mean a whhhiiiilllleee... it was finally time for me to venture down to the university of chicago to visit plein air cafe. it's a cool and beautiful as i imagined. sitting literally in the shadows of the robbie house (swoon), it's has an amazing outdoor patio and gorgeous interior. there are lots of options for coffee and specialty drinks, as well as baked goods and legit breakfasts. i had a latte and quiche w (how you spell?) with a salad. both were fantastic and only made better by the beautiful surroundings.  uofc is a beautiful campus and i can't wait to explore more!!! i'll be back, maybe they will let me move in even?i went for brunch on a sunday morning, i felt the menu items seemed overpriced and considered going somewhere else but decided to stick it out. the portions were small for brunch, and definitely small for how much they cost. the eggs were underwhelming, and the potatoes would've been delicious if they weren't cold. nice ambiance, but i won't be returning.i absolutely love this place! the soy mocha is one of the best i've ever had. i've tried their turkey and brie sandwich and it was fresh and yummy. i also have tried the homemade biscuit breakfast sandwich with egg, manchego cheese and bacon. the bacon was thick and crispy and the cheese was melted on the egg. everything i've had, i have enjoyed. i also enjoy getting work done here. although sometimes it is too loud. overall great spot on campus!so pretentious! just 1 eg of customer service at this place: do you name your latte with a single shot? no, with 2. could you reduce it pls? 1, 1.5, 0.5? no + eye roll + weird face. can't say i'm surprised.i have historically enjoyed the food and coffee. however, the customer service is poor. the staff are pretentious and not courteous. my boyfriend and i ordered horchata lattes. i have ordered horchata at many restaurants and coffee shops. the drink was gritty and not enjoyable to drink. i asked if they could remake me a drink. if it was a no, i would understand, but the employee attempted to explain to me what horchata is and said that it has ground almonds in it which is the why the texture is like "granita". i did not appreciate the poor attitude.okay food in an okay, but usually too packed, environment. the prices are just slightly too high for what you get, and the seating isn't really conducive to work or conversation. overrated, in my opinion.such a beautiful coffee shop !!! it has a such a nice view of the campus from the wall of windows . the lavender lemonade is so refreshing ! the chicken sandwich is very light but filling lunch or dinner .great cafe to get simple work done, or catch up over some light reading material. located in the basement of the chicago theological seminary, the co-op bookshop that's connected to this cafe is favored by all university students and faculty alike. always busy; moderate to loud noise level; true university cafe; outdoor seating available.delicious coffee and food in an excellent location. only drawbacks are that it's a little more on the pricey side and can sometimes get pretty crowded. if it's a nice day there's quite a bit of outdoor seating as well.highly recommend.not very good. i went because i heard the breakfast was fantastic, and i arrived at 12:08 and they said they stopped serving it at 12... the girl was very rude about it too... i got the vegan grain bowl and it was not very good at all. do not recommend. i couldn't even taste the spinach pesto at all. plus it was expensive. so not worth it. pretty cute inside and they had a deck area thoa quiet and comfortable cafe right beside the university of chicago. reasonable food and price. we love the way it present and the atmosphere of the store-exactly as the name of store!worst customer service ever! the manager and some of the servers here are incredibly rude. if you guys have hard and fast rules, such as no sitting before ordering and no bringing in outside food, make that explicitly clear (also, are you really losing business if i don't order coffee but the friends i am with order sandwiches and drinks?). don't yell at customers for things they aren't aware of - there is just no need to be so mean over something so trivial. as much as i like the coffee here, really doubting it's all worth the unfriendliness.p.s. i've definitely seen other people violate these so-called "rules" and not get called out publicly. is there a specific reason why you target some but not others?the atmosphere is lovely here, right next to the robie house and within walking distance to the oriental museum.  the outdoor seating is nice and shaded with very cool wooden tables and benches.  the coffee and espresso drinks are not bad, the treats are generally very good - blueberry danishes, various poundcakes, delicious biscuits with butter and jam...i've never eaten anything here except the treats but the other menu items look very good.  the breakfast menu looks fabulous with dishes such as mascarpone stuffed brioche french toast or a spinach royal pie.  i've had the royal pies elsewhere - they are from pleasant house bakery and are divine.  so, this place has quite a lot going for it except one thing - polite service.  this is sad because it's such a nice place otherwise. the service comes with a lot of attitude, for some reason.  i don't know why this is but it seems to be quite consistent. too bad.while the quality of the food is good enough, the selection is very minimal and everything is overpriced for what you get. service is hit or miss. i will continue to eat here if friends request it, but i never recommend it myself -- there are much better options in hyde park.such a gem in hyde park. beautiful baked goods and fresh espresso drinks made with good beans and experienced baristas. beats the crap out of the starbucks on campus, though perhaps rivaled by the divinity school...regardless, a great place to study with lots of seating including some benches with tables outdoors. has a vintage look to it.nice cafe for a coffee and chat with floor to ceiling windows and gets a lot of natural light. good serviceprobably one of the highest quality places to eat in hyde park. great for brunch, i love their pastries. both indoor and outdoor seating are comfortable.i really liked plein air. it has a pricey menu, but the rustic/simple vibes are tasteful, along with their coffee drinks. the maple latte tasted well-balanced, even if it was a little too sweet for me. for brekki, i tried a quiche (kale + roasted pepper + gruyere cheese), and its dough had a buttery, flaky texture that melted on my tongue. so good--would definitely recommend as a simple brunch!plein air opened in the spring of last year, and it's quickly become my favorite dining option nearby the harper center on the university of chicago campus (because let's face it, the harper cafeteria stinks). it's a hop-skip away from harper as well, which makes the commute more palatable than decent options like medici, salonica, or the food trucks.plein air has a partnership with pleasant house bakery, and though the $10+ price tag is semi-steep for a quick lunch, a taste of a royal pie (i recommend the steak and ale) will leave your stomach feeling satisfied, if not your wallet. i've gotten a pastry a time or two as well. i remember the croissant being fine, as in better than starbucks, but not quite up to a parisian standard. their sandwich baguette bread is simply too hard to be palatable. if you're going sandwich, i recommend making the extra hike to medici.i like to pair a pie with a maple latte (in the winter; they've since switched to vanilla), which really sets the bank account back. but that latte is fantastically delicious. plein air uses metric coffee. i don't love it as much as my other go-to's like intelligensia, la colombe, or passion house, but it's pretty good (and still better than the starbucks or intelligensia franchised coffee in harper).cute little cafe in u of c campus... kind of hard to get seats with all the studying students but the food is pretty goodit's really like 3.3 stars. i wanted to like the place because their coffee is amazing, the food is really well made and delicious (strongly recommend a hazelnut beignet) and the spot itself is nicely laid out with cute decor for the heyday of hyde park. but the over-pretentiousness of the staff and their rude misdemeanor completely ruins it.  i mean, i live in the hipster capital of the world (seattle) but at least our baristas are somewhat friendly and courteous.  when i'm back in hyde park i might try this again, if there are no other options in the area...stunningly modern and a calm and comfortable atmosphere. beautiful outdoor seating area. seamless ordering/delivery of food and drinks. the espresso is exceptional. the food is healthy, interesting, and satisfying.right alongside the robie house you will find the plein cafe.we needed to kill time waiting for our tour and went in.the music was some kind of ear splitting post punk and was irritating as hell.music that hurts your ears is not conducive to anything else but deafness and tinnuitis.fortunately it was warm and we could go to an outside table.we weren't sure what we wanted  and ordered macchiatos- which to tell the truth we couldn't remember what they were -which were good.i also ordered a raspberry beignet which was also good.so my attitude towards the place was positive  but extreme noise is not conducive to thought or pleasure.overall: good drinks, better food, nice atmosphere, but pricey. good place to take my parents when they are in town and want to grab a coffee or casual breakfast, but at a nice place. the only reason it loses a star is the price and that the chai is often lukewarm rather than hot. drinks: i've had the chai latte and lemonade. my chai was good, but nothing great. the lemonade was very delicious. my friends who drink coffee think the coffee is great.food: there food is really well done. i highly recommend the french toast for breakfast and the mushroom pie for lunch. if you want a light breakfast or snack the sourdough toast with butter and honey is delicious! atmosphere: a little typical hipster, but still very nice and the co-op is a great bookstore. definitely take the time to walk around the uchicago campus or go to the oriental institute museum which is close by.i was at the university of chicago and decided to go here for lunch because of all the positive reviews. it was really busy when i arrived around lunchtime. i love that you can eat outside with a view of the robie house next door. i ordered the steak & ale pie which included all-natural beef, ale, carrots and herbs with a side salad. the portion looked small at first, but once you start eating it, it's really filling. the meat was tender and flavorful. i recommend coming here for lunch if you're in hyde park.a cute little cafe with great coffee and savory pies! the vanilla latte is especially good - they make the syrup themselves, which has a noticeably fresh and deep taste. i also really like the ginger plum iced tea. my favorite pie is the mushroom and kale pie -- it's creamy, mushroomy, and amazing. the crust is super flaky, too. they also do great scones.i really like the decor. the space is very light, airy, and open and i think the animals and plants contribute to that, even if it is a bit overly hipstery. it makes me think of an ecology lab :). i also really love the outdoor space, which is super nice. the negative points: 1) service is just kinda mediocre; 2) not enough outlets; 3) not enough space when it gets busy; 4) no wifi (unless you can connect to uchicago)! altogether, though, it's a very nice place to meet people for coffee and chill as long as you're not going between 11:30 and 1:30 when it's ridiculously busy.plein air easily has the best coffee in hyde park--a rotation selection of wonderful, locally-roasted beans from the metric coffee company. plus, they'll happily take the time to make a pour over of your choice.this is also a great spot to grab a quick bite: they've got great quiche and croissants in the morning, and quality soups, sandwiches, and salads at lunch. the food is a bit on the expensive side, but it's not overpriced for the quality.the space is great, too--albeit a bit on the crowded side during the lunch rush. limited outlets, but on the whole it's probably a good thing that they somewhat discourage the macbook-toting hordes from camping out all day. staff is friendly and efficient.loved it!!! i ordered a latte and a chocolate croissant- both were above average. very hip interior, and a cool young crowd. perfect location next to the robie house and an inviting bookstore. i will be back!this is my favorite brunch spot in the area. the coffee is great and the baristas are knowledgeable. the food is fantastic- great quiche variety (and they're all delicious) and the breakfast sandwich is one of the best breakfast sandwiches i've ever had. if your order doesn't come with bacon, i recommend ordering a side order because it's delicious. the water on tap by the counter is cool too, especially because you can get sparkling water.the atmosphere is great, too. it's busy but a table always opens up quickly, and the interior is nice and bright, with some cool art featured. if it's nice, though, try to get a table outside- it's really peaceful and you have a great view of the side of the robie house.i go periodically because i live in hyde park and they do make good coffee, despite the high prices.  but at this point, i can't stand the sheer arrogance and disdain. a lot of what plein air sells is atmosphere, and apparently, they've decided that part of that atmosphere is that they're too cool for the customers.for a while, i saw this coming primarily from the managers, but some of staff seem to have picked it up too.  (rumor among students is that they barely pay minimum wage, so i guess that it's hard to blame the staff too much...but i also don't enjoy being treated like dirt.)(i also notice that they claim to be wheelchair accessible.  and they probably do meet the (low) standards of the ada.  but weelchair users should know that all but half a dozen of the tables are quite high.  if someone can't transfer from their chair to one of the tall stools, i doubt that they could sit there.  the aisles are also pretty narrow--if other patrons don't have their seats pulled all the way in, it could be tricky to navigate a power chair through.)the food and drinks were good but i found this place expensive and a little confusing. only the drink menu is prominently displayed, the food menu is on pieces on paper in a box on the wall but not very noticeable. the staff were okay but not all that friendly.best café in hyde park!i recently discovered this place and i couldn't be happier!it has this organic / local produce / quality-coffee vibe with a small yet delicious breakfast and lunch menu!i had a breakfast quiche last time i visited and was impressed by the quality. everything i've ordered leans to the healthy end and has been absolutely delicious. staff is very friendly too. you can't go wrong with this place whether you're looking for breakfast, lunch, coffee or a mid-afternoon sweet.plein air is the only of its kind in hyde park, and the troves of students flooding the place on weekdays during the school year testify this.as others have noted, the place keeps a definite minimalist vibe which with whitewash counters and tables topped with air plants, and the menu speaks to much of the same.  diners enter either through the seminary coop bookstore's front or from the sideyard and order while standing at the barfront, toting a table number back with them for service.as for the food, breakfast at plein air, to me, calls for the continental breakfast complete with the most delicious biscuit available in hyde park.  the pastries and royal pies are ok, but not quite the cigar you'll find in the continental.  all the coffee drinks, in my opinion, are pretty delish.  easily the best latte in the park.  for lunch, you can't go wrong with the baguette sandwiches or the grain bowls.  they're all great, and they're perfectly satisfying.the customer service, like its architecture, is pretty minimal, as it's a quick order place and your only interactions will likely be when you order and when your food arrives, which is pretty nice if you're there to take in a little me-time with a book or dining al fresco with a group on the patio (recommended).  if crowds or time is a concern, weekends are a perfect time to go and enjoy without feeling rushed, and even ideal for a pleasant start to the weekend.amazing meatloaf.  the bread was soaked with delicious gravy and still had crunchy exterior.  i devoured it. fun interior - bright with a vintage feel.this is a great place to grab coffee or a quick bite between classes. i generally come here one to two times a week, given the proximity to harper. while it's a healthier and fresher alternative to other places on campus, it can be crowded at times, with a line that can stretch to the back of the restaurant and rude undergrads saving spots for their friends that haven't arrived (the wait staff tries to monitor this during peak hours but sometimes you have to take your own measures).for pastries, go for the biscuit. it's served warm with butter and blueberry jam and its buttery goodness is too delicious to pass up. for lunch, try their tartines or grain bowls - they're flavorful, healthy and loaded with vegetables.there must be a purpose to every act. the purpose of this review is to inform the public about the inedible properties of the sandwiches produced at this location. i have patronized this place once in the past and was left unimpressed at the plebian nature of the food served. however, i would like share an incident that happened two weeks ago: when my very good friend madeleine purchased a sandwich here. the sandwich was so hard, that it chipped her tooth. i will now illuminate how hard the bread of the sandwich was. if this bread had been at the last supper, we wouldn't have had a savior, but a jewish man with tooth ache. bread of this strength would serve as a stronger deterrent against immigrants from coming to the us than trump's proposed wall. the bread provided enormous resistance. so much, that madeleine's front left canine tooth looked like gnomes had mistaken it for marble ripe for sculpture-making and then abandoned the project realizing their mistake. the incident left madeleine looking like a lopsided dracula. when she would open her mouth, i was just as terrified as the ottoman force that once approached the real dracula's stronghold. so i warn the readers who are perusing through this review, if you are unfortunate enough to purchase sandwich at this business, be sure to check if the sandwich bends under duress. this is one material strength test that you must hope fails. many in the yelp community are for some reason obsessed with location and atmosphere. i will devote the last part of my review for this demographic. painting a piece of iron bar with golden pigment would not make the bar gold. similarly, serving mediocre food in a posh location would not change the quality of mediocre food. this is the kind of place where you would hope to seduce an atheist divinity student from portland, oregon whose patrician aspirations would be to dwell in williamsburg, brooklyn. perfect for the up and coming bourgeoisie crowd who would gawk and gape at a whole foods.  with all that being said, i hope the plein air staff realize that mediocrity of their pursuit. i urge them to work on the softness of their breads, and improve the taste of their sandwiches. plein air looks good because it is in a prime location within hyde park. plein air are like the poor mughal empire which only looked advanced because greedy east indian company twats haven't arrived yet with steel and gunpowder. better call it plain air from now.if you are into fun, hipstery, slightly overpriced food options in a cut atmosphere right here on campus, this place is pretty all of that and more. yup, adorable little spot right next to the bookstore with long tables for group dining and a nice outdoor patio space all of which fills up pretty quickly during lunch rush times on campus. and understandably so since campus lunch options nearby don't have the healthiest options really, and this place having tasty kale salads and quinoa bowls it is good brain food for anyone needing a break from work on campus!i got their quinoa bowl with a tomato curry sauce and you can tell that everything was really fresh. their pies are also super popular and they often run out i've been told, so go earlier on in the day if that is something that you want. i definitely need to come back and try and their steak and ale pie (and then hopefully split that with someone who wants the kale salad with citrus and quinoa to try and make it a little healthier ha ha) but for the area, if you can find a spot sit here, they have great coffee drinks and such, and yes it is a little pricey, but hipster food land always is :-)listen, let's talk about the house made biscuit sandwich which has egg, manchego cheese, smoked bacon. that sandwich is deeeeeelish! good! superb! everythang! the biscuit is so soft and fluffy and buttery! good, solid bacon and perfect eggs. it was well-made. my friends, it's a good sandwich. try it! it also comes with a side of potatoes which were good but the sandwich is amazing. i also had a hazelnut beignet which was pretty good. it came from la fournette as do some of their other offerings. good coffee by metric. who knew? check it out.i was so excited to hear that this place was opening up as soon as i found out they were serving royal pies from pleasant house bakery. i thought i would be here every week, enjoying those delicious pies. but i was not there every week. i was only there once.one trip to plein air cafe was enough for me. for starters, the menu is super confusing in that it is half hidden. when you enter the restaurant (right off the seminary co-op bookstore), all you see is a menu for coffee drinks. nothing else. you have to go up to the register to find the menu of pastries and other savory items. the food is good. the royal pies (i had the chicken balti) are as delicious as expected. but their service needs work. i ordered the chicken balti pie at the register and had something else (i think a salad) delivered to me instead. i stared at it for a while wondering what it was before taking it up to the register. i had to stand and wait in line again to return it as everyone moving around the service door ignored me. i found that incredibly annoying considering it was lunch rush and the line took about 10 minutes to go through.finally, my actual pie was delivered and i thought i could get some work down while i ate. wrong. the music is a weird, eclectic mix that is way too loud for the tiny room it's projected into. to make matters worse, the tables are stacked basically on top of each other so you can hear the entire conversation from the group next to you, including inflections and breaths. the overall decor is a bit confusing. some taxidermy, some cacti. to be honest, i thought they were cute until i realized there was very little room for two plates, two drinks, and the centerpieces. my friend and i spent a few minutes maneuvering everything before we could actually settle down to do work. at the end of the experience, i didn't feel the need to go back. $10+ dollars on lunch in a crowded room with loud music and very few outlets. not something worth returning for. sorry, plein air.this is an arrogant business that refuses to listen to its customers.  i have been e-mailing, asking in person, and reaching out to the owners for over a year about the total lack of sugar free, healthy items on the menu.  you would think the veggies and quinoa would be okay, but they do add sugar, and this means a no go for me.  they also fail to understand the need for unsweetened (no sugar added) non-dairy alternatives for decaf lattes.  at first they promised a quick fix, but after waiting in a long line three times the following months, i found that they had not even heard of the problem or addressed it.  sugar free soy and almond milk are now standard everywhere else in town, but hyde park is a pathetic vortex of food evil filled with ignorant business owners and managers who do not know how to read the back label on a box of food.  shame on soo choi and kevin heisner for not even reading their e-mail or responding.  plein air has the potential to be better, but if i could give negative stars, i gladly would.very fresh ingredients, but a bit on the pricey side. overall all four in my party were satisfied. we all ordered lunch entrees. very nice atmosphere.disappointing customer service!!!  bring your patience and thickskinned.  i ordered as take out a bowl of oatmeal and after 10 minutes of waiting i asked about it.  woman working the coffee machine responds that i have to "wait my turn"; quite unnecessary and snarky.plein air is a great café.the ambiance is pleasant. there's a good white noise level for my study habits, all the seating is pretty comfy, and there's a large outdoor area.you can spend $12 on a small lunch here but you don't need to- there are good $7 options if cost is a hang-up, and pastries are less expensive than at starbucks. anyway it's all lovingly made with good ingredients from local food makers. free mineral water is a perk, and they brew coffee in many different ways.service is quick and friendly. support these guys!woah this place is soooooo cool. as a northwestern student i can't believe u chicago has such an amazing establishment. their chocolate brioche was dry. my friend got the prosciutto sandwich and it was pretty delicious besides the fact that the bread was also a little dry. love the vibe though, keep it up.coffee was fine but the service was unfriendly and pretentious. i prefer my coffee with cream and no attitude, thanks.my spouse and i are vegan and we selected this place as it has vegan options. however, when our group of seven arrived around 6:30pm i was informed that the vegan options are only available from 11:00 am to 3:00 pm (this is not on their website). if you are vegan i guess you have to only eat lunch or in our case will go elsewhere so we can have a meal with friends. the standard line of we can make you a salad without the cheese is not acceptable. the members of our party that did get sandwiches were told you couldn't get some things left off or added as all of the sandwiches came pre-made, uckk.conveniently oriented next to frank lloyd wright's robie house, plein air cafe invites you in.  after buying my ticket for the tour, i seized the opportunity to grab brunch, to my pleasant surprise!having lived in europe, i was pleased by nostalgia & strong contrasts in the cafe.  cottage, industrial & minimalist combine for an inviting, warm atmosphere. three taxidermy art pieces complement the warm wood table tops & starkly contrast with the cool industrial pipes & chairs. contrast is compelling!quiche with ham & gruyere cheese, together with a very flakey crust & ethereal egg custard, accompanied with mixed greens & a very light vinaigrette satisfied my sunday wedding reception recovery & with water. then the raspberry beignets & english breakfast tea steeped exactly for 4.5 minutes, made my day!what appealed to me besides the perfect location & cool decor was the welcoming ambiance. from the butcher block table tops on industrial pipes, to the hooks for my messenger bag, to the courteous wait staff, plein air cafe is home to professors, neighbors, students, tourists & wanderers.i chose to sit at one of the two long tables with a taxidermy bird perched under a glass cloche. when three professors joined me, the bird gave us a great ice breaker discussion.  we even discussed the wall display of a red tailed fox, as having been caught in the hen house.overall, the ambiance, convenience, delicious offerings & garden view beckoned. window service & self-busing make sense in this venue. plein air cafe is a great stop for frank lloyd wright fans!what a neat little place to eat. while roaming chicago, i needed something to eat while touring the campus. plein air did not disappoint. the ambiance is really neat. think clean and modern mixed with antiques and taxidermy.my only warning is not to go to plein air when you're in a hurry as the line can be long and the food takes a little while to arrive.this place is pretty cute with indoor and outdoor seating and a great view of robie house from wherever! it's a small space indoors and tends to have a long line - the line stayed pretty long for the hour and a half that i spent here. i loved the hot chocolate: not too milky, but sweet. a lot of people do their work/studying here, but it can be loud so i wouldn't recommend it if you're a quiet study person. the food was just okay to me. i ordered the seasonal omelette, which comes with potatoes with spices on them. the omelet itself had a lot of cheese, so someone else might like it better! service is slow and the staff don't really talk to you, but it's a good place to come in and try at some point.amazing cafe! so glad i found this place and that it happens to be a block away from where i keep busy.i'm a sucker for their vanilla lattes and pretty much anything on their menu. i've tried a few the following and i'd gladly order them again: spinach pies, homemade biscuit breakfast sandwiches, and prosciutto & manchego baguette with house made fig jam. they're almost 5-star worthy except for two things:(1) a bit pricey so hard to budget daily trips although the quality is obvious across their menu(2) one time they gave me a regular latte when i ordered a vanilla lattedespite my pettiness, this is a great establishment and you should check it out!really great place: great food and coffee, one of the only really nice places to eat outside with a beautiful outdoor area, friendly staff, nice owner.sometimes i forget why i hate plein air and i decide to come back for the vegetable sandwich thing, which is pretty delicious. once i get inside though i remember that everything about the place is pretentious and overpriced and i feel like puking. don't come here unless it's like 3 pm and your parents are paying and you want to talk about hillary or eugenics.attractive people in drab sweaters and dark pants sharing a communal table. lots of good natural light, gorgeous location underneath a tree next to the robie house. food is great, portions are small and it is pretty expensive. bubbly water on tap is a great addition. like the marble and black theme. you're going to be bumping elbows a ton at lunch time, but go next door and buy a book. delicious pastries, great lattes. dreamy and cramped.this is my new favorite coffee shop/ study spot. the coffee and tea is awesome, but so are the baked goods and their full menu of breakfast and lunch. my favorites have to be the hazelnut beignet with an americano (or any espresso drink for that matter) for the morning--or their mushroom kale pie for lunch. they also have serve yourself water which has both still and sparkling. if you like a mild hum and a great mix of indie/oldies rock music (which has to be my favorite combo), this is likely even a good place to bring a book or coursework. when i heard the shins come on, i knew it was going to be my go-to spot near uchicago.coffee is good, the atmosphere is nice and good for working and people who go to the coffeeshop tend to be very friendly. definitely coming backfirst of all, they have all you want self-serve seltzer water. i loved that.  secondly, you can sit and eat and look at the backside of frank lloyd wright's robie house, which is right nextdoor.  can't beat that. then, they have really good coffees. i had a first-rate latte.  so the food just has to be decent...and it was. i had steel cut oatmeal, well-prepared and presented. what a nice place to eat. would be happy to go there anytime!love the atmosphere here a lot! unlike other reviewers i don't have any problems with the service here. this place is also wonderful for people who seek some nice and quiet time being by themselves. you won't find it uncomfortable at all coming here alone. i would only suggest staying away from ordering anything with baguettes if you are new to this place. i might have come on the wrong day but i didn't like the chicken baguette at all - the bread just tasted like rubber:/as a grad student at u of c i've been here a number of times. i want to like the place... hyde park desperately needs cafés with cool vibes and decent food and study space. this place provides all three, but i find myself avoiding it anyway because i can't stand the customer service. i'm talking about multiple occasions when the staff has been extremely unaccommodating to the point of rudeness. i'd rather go to one of the student run places on campus than pay twice as much to be scowled at by the servers because they serve slightly higher quality food.plein air is a perfect place to refuel and recharge midday. if the weather is nice, it has a great courtyard, to relax, but quiet enough to get things done. also, if you are showing off campus, your people can walk the bookstore while you prepare for class.i love this little cafe. their food is great, the atmosphere is peaceful and kind of euro, and they have won my heart by having sparkling water on tap. plus they have these biscuits with jam and butter that are a simple and delicious breakfast treat. they have your typical coffee shop offerings as well as a sort of small but really delicious breakfast and lunch menu. i highly recommend stopping by here if you're near u chicago's campus, especially if the weather is nice as their outdoor patio is really wonderful.most coffee shops on the university of chicago campus exist in the following dichotomy: those located in dingy basements and those located in dingy attics. given that fact, it is probably no surprise that the plein air cafe has received the sort of reception it has, or so i hear; its attitude and decor are not so dissimilar from some of the eateries populating the old warehouses in the west loop (and with much commercial success, i also hear).the last time i came here for brunch it was a continental breakfast, a slice of quiche and two coffees - none of it very memorable - but let's all be honest with each other and admit it was never about the food. for those coming to hyde park from other colleges, in particular, for masters programs in the humanities, there is demand for a place to eat which is just slightly out the the price range for most milktoast-colored undergraduates and plein air is just such a place. alternatively, one should just admit that after 10 years in a phd program sipping coffee in a cafe instead of typing away in a computer lab that you were never that serious about art history anyway.obviously, for a bong-smoking lolcat, this is not my scene - though the taxidermy animals don't help either. i'll take my coffee to go in a $1 giant thermos from across the street and skulk back into the gray cubicle-laden land where i belong.if you somehow find something to complain about regarding this beautiful, unique cafe, i think it says more about you than this business, because it's on par with the best cafes in chicago. be a good customer, and you will usually be given great service- that is the rule in all of the good land of capitalism.i've been here half a dozen times now, and every single time- the food has been fantastic, the coffee even better, service on par with the best. the physical space is gorgeous, with plenty of natural light and in spitting distance of seminary co-op, the best bookstore in chicagoland. the space is clean, inviting, and the menu is diverse. be cognizant of the physical space you take in this highly trafficked area of a busy college campus, and you will certainly enjoy your experience at plein air.fresh food prepared to order, limited menu but very nice -- coffees, teas, lemonade, some sodas, pastries, sandwiches, soups. good for a quick bite that is healthy and delish. i had the turkey & cheese (brie-ish) on artisan bread with greens on the side. would love to try everything on the menu! next to the u of chi seminary bookstore and     adjacent the historic robie house. interesting artwork.solid fan of plein air. this is the perfect place to get some casual work done, or get coffee with someone whether just for fun or for a meeting; it's ideal for nearly every college related occasion.i am a huge fan of their coffee, i've had their cappucinos, macchiatos and lattes and i've been very pleased with the quality and taste of each time. their sandwiches are decent but not great, and the pies are much better (though quite pricey for the small portion). service is friendly and speedy, and i love how they offer tap water or sparkling tap water in cute mini mason jars. just makes it an overall very casually classy place.disappointed.people love the ambiance here. i do too, and that's only reason that i tried it twice without knowing much about the food offered there. it's right next to the robie house in hyde park. what else can you ask for? if we move it to river north, i am not so sure how long it will last though. the best part about the service here is that you have three kinds of water to select from-- hot, cold and fizzy water. it's mostly a self-serve restaurant, like chipotle, but with a higher price tag and fewer selections, and you will be advised to pay 15% or above for tip when you tap on that trendy mini ipad. i ordered the meatloaf tartine. the meatloaf did not have much flavor, and the gravy came with the meatloaf made the bread too mushy. not the best $12 lunch i have had.be aware! the corner table is reserved for a group of 4 or 4+. the warning note placed on the table is tiny. so you can easily miss it. if you accidentally sit there, you will be asked to move.i came to plein air cafe last week with my a colleague, and i was pleasantly surprised. hyde park is definitely coming up in the world as far as more restaurants, bars and entertainment. it's nice to know this place exist and it's so close to university of chicago campus.  at any rate, plein air cafe reminded me of antique taco for the decorations. it's very antique-like, shabby chic decorated with a chill vibe (or very country hipster--and yes, i just invented that word but it fits). they offer a variety of pastries, coffees, teas, salads, sandwiches and pies. i decided to check out the meat pies (a fancy pot pie) because per yelp they seemed highly recommended. i ordered the kale pie, and it was delicious! inside the pie, was a marriage of flavors. it had kale, herbs, parmesan cheese and white wine sauce. beyond fabulous. i did not leave one crumb on the plate. if you are a meat eater and you order this dish---there won't be a minute where you miss the meat. the crust of the pie was heavenly as well. the crust is buttery, flaky, soft inside yet crunchy outside.  the pie comes with a small serving of field greens  that are lightly dressed in balsamic. the pies seem petite but they are very deep (or high in height) and it's pretty filling. my friend order the goat cheese sandwich on a baguette which was also served with field greens. it looked very delicious as well. in addition, they have a water station where you can decide between "still", "chilled", and "sparkling" water which is quite fancy. i'd definitely return back to plein air cafe.first and foremost, this place is huge! that alone made me a fan within seconds. it does a brisk business and yet there's always seating to be had. the staff is very nice and accommodating, the space is well-maintained, and the coffee and sandwiches are good, and very fairly priced. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the donut. not that good. frosting, yes. but the rest of it was a little tasteless. but that's small stuff. robust is well worth a visit. at least three times a week, i bike down from the north side to somewhere on the south side or western suburbs for exercise and exploration, then work remotely, so i'll be coming in all fall and winter. this place is a keeper. pro-tip: it will get a little loud during the bottom of the 3:00 hour when a lot of kids roll in rom one of the local schools. they're fine overall, but they are teenagers, so they're going to be a little loud. but the vast majority of them take their food to go, so it's a mild annoyance at worst.i love this coffee shop because it's a nice place where i am able to get my work done when i want to get out the house. my only disappointment is that they are frequently out of chai tea when i visit in the afternoons. they also have a pretty good selection of sandwiches and small salads.i see based on other reviews i have to try the honey nut latte. i'll try on my next visit.robust is such a great space to work or meet up with friends.food: i like to get the bacon, egg, and cheese on an english muffin. the first time i ordered it, i ate it so fast i forgot to take a picture. lol. when i went back the second time, i remembered. they also have donuts and a variety of food (sandwiches, salads) you can order. drinks: i enjoy their berry smoothie. the first time i went, i ordered the honey nut latte. it was decent, but i prefer to go to robust for the food and the space. space: robust is huge. there is a ton of space in the front and the back. you never feel too closed in next to someone  else. the cafe has nice big windows which lets in a lot of natural light. service: the service is always good. the baristas and cashiers are always kind, and provide good service. i definitely recommend going to robust. if i lived closer i would definitely be a regular.so happy this gem is in my neighborhood. i've been coming here for about 3 years. i can enjoy robust even when i'm working from home because they deliver! we love the breakfast sandwich and brisket grilled cheese.let's spend a second dreaming about that honey nut latte. holy delicious! who knew coffee, almond milk and honey could be so perfect?! i will say, it is a bit pricey at almost $5.50, but as a very occasional treat, 100% worth it! while i was there i also (calorically, not monetarily) splurged on an amazing double chocolate cake donut. i had to remind myself that i was in public and need not inhale it. their drinks and sweets are so on point at robust. pro-tip: between 6am-8am all food is 50%!the only downfall is not everyone that works there is kind or efficient. they typically have one person working cash register (and serving simple black coffee) and one person making all of the other drinks, so if you snoozed, you're losing, because you might be 10th in line even at 7:30am! .... totally worth it though for that honey nut latte and donut :)cute little shop in hyde park. i ordered a croissant and coffee which i really enjoyed. inside looks really trendy for anyone that cares about aesthetics. check this place out if you haven't.stopped in because need a pick me up. their speciality is the mocha diablo..it is espresso, milk and the in house diablo syrup. i did almond milk instead of regular milk. i will say that the diablo is the bomb! it's the right hint of spicy and also not too sweet. they also have an assortment of pastries but i didn't try any..if you want a cute little coffee shop i think robust will provide.this place has gone so far downhill i can hardly believe it. was once my go-to in the area for a mocha, and occasionally a breakfast croissant or a grilled cheese. between the worsening staff, the constant array of bugs and occasional mice, and the food now struggling to meet mediocre quality, there's no longer much reason to come here at all. the staff used to be friendly and fun! their reward card is a joke as well-- i got large drinks every time i came here. fill up the reward card and you get a small (ridiculously small) drink. i asked if i could pay the difference and get my large-- 70 cents more than the small. the reply should have been no problem, you're a regular customer, we'll cover that 70 cents. instead it was "reward card upgrades cost a dollar." i pointed out that the price difference was less than that, and the rude girl just repeated herself. if you all don't give a shit about your customers-- let alone the ones that are here 4-5 times a week-- then screw this place.i've been going to robust for 6 years now.  it continually has gotten worse and worse.  the mochas are more foam than liquid now like a cappuccino.  i understand it happening once or twice, but it's been several times now. i'm not paying $5 for foam.  a sandwich, chip, and pop are always over $10 and the wait to get the sandwich is often near 10 minutes. this is acceptable if the food is unique or good, but the food is rather mediocre and not worth the price. starbucks is about a mile north on woodlawn, i might have to start travelling there for my caffeine kick.interesting!!! this is a college district, so i would image things would be cheaper - i guess not. came here with a friend, just so happens the same sandwich caught both our eyes - the brisket grilled cheese...yum!  although it was very tasty, i don't think i'd come back. the price of $9.37 for a grilled cheese with a few shredded pieces of beef with no fries/chips or a drink...that's super expensive. my friend's total came to $15.37, she ordered a small coffee which btw is $5.50.  it's another $1.75 to upgrade it wasn't worth it.  also, i would image this venue is relatively new, the space is nice and it seats a great number of people, but the seats are horrible. they're all taped up and sunken in. i'm not sitting on that, gross!!best coffee house bar in south side chicago. very nice friendly baristas. their caramel frappe is the best! its way better than starbucks & dunkin' donuts! i love the atmosphere. it's very chilling in there. i live in highland indiana, and i be taking the cta stony island bus getting off at 63rd and take 10 minute walk to 63rd & woodlawn. my buddy recommended me this coffee shop. the area is little rough, but this coffee shop is a must stop. i'll be coming back once in the while. keep up the good work right here. i will continue to supporting this place!not the friendliest baristas or the best tasting coffee. i guess they get points for the solid pastries and sandwiches. i actively look to support small local businesses and i want robust coffee to succeed. their long-term success will coincide with a stronger focus on customer service. they have a really cool space, they just need to hire staff to better represent the business.i love their half off breakfast deal from 6-8. robust bowl with sausage is my favorite. they also have many options for lunch items and i've recently had one of their newest salads (chopped bellview salad). delicious!!!! i do have to say i enjoy coming here after 9ish since it can be really busy for the half off breakfast deal and a little noisy because of the school kids.i don't come to robust often, mostly because it's a bit out of the way from everything else around the hyde park/woodlawn area. buuut, when i do come, i am never disappointed. i'm not a coffee drinker (although i hear their coffee is incredible), but i do like hot chocolate. and their white hot chocolate is the absolute best. during the winter, i am willing to walk a mile and a half in 15 degree weather down from my apartment just to satisfy my robust craving. in the summers, i get their lemonades which are also great.the apple fritters--divine. the donuts--delicious.this place is a hidden gem, and it's great for the flourishing community in the woodlawn area. there is always street parking and is a 15 min walk away from the uchicago campus.great coffee and the food is even better.. not the best area to hang around in but all in all it's worth it.quick tip: when ordering the elvis be sure they don't water it down or skimp out on the peanut butter...love love love! great coffee and atmosphere. try the breve iced with an extra espresso shot - my go to. best part... parking is always available! the only con is it is a bit pricey but typical for a great coffee shop. the employees are super friendly too!friendly staff and really good coffee. i had a tuna melt and i was very pleased with it. it was fresh and it came with candy. i didn't know it was going to have candy, so that was an neat surprise. i also like the location. i work in that area and usually get dunkin donuts by the train. i had extra time and was further down 63rd and found this place. note: they made a mistake on one of my orders,  but were so nice and handled things well. major props for that.this is my favorite coffee house.  the staff is always pleasant, patient and helpful. it's my go to for coffee, remote office, quick bites or just to see a smiling face.i was in town a couple of weeks ago staying in the area and heard this place was worth a try so we ordered for delivery. got our food pretty quickly, the french toast was really good and definitely a good recommendation. definitely recommend this place.there are two rooms here: an airy one with lots of windows on the corner, and a cosier one where lots of men are playing chess. the regular coffee is pretty good, and comes in a very large mug. apparently the breakfast sandwiches are also good. we got a grilled cheese without the bacon, and a bagel sandwich. both were good (especially the grilled cheese), and we appreciated that the server confirmed that it was a grilled cheese without bacon when serving it. the mudslide was fun for being so decadent, but i didn't actually love it, though i can't say exactly why. next time i might just get a donut.very nice place. i ordered the banana bread french toast, very tasty. they have a nice size menu. can't wait to return to try other things on the menu.robust needs to take care of its respect for the local neighborhood asap. i have been there multiple times and seen the management behave incredibly inappropriately towards local hs students. students cannot be told to their face they are "good kids" or "bad kids." the owner is especially disrespectful about this situation. it needs to be remedied right away.my children have been long time patrons of robust coffee because it is within walking distance from their school however the lack of respect and appreciation for the students and staff who are the main contributors to their success is unacceptable.if you want to be treated like crap and experience the neighborhood teenagers being treated like worse than crap, come here.  i work in the neighborhood and have never experienced such poor service (20 minute wait for a bagel, old veggies with their hummus plate, wrong items in the order). it's one thing to treat me poorly (i have a car and can go elsewhere easily), but a completely different story when you're just plain disrespectful to the young people who go to the high school just down the block. you would think they would join forces with the school, but from what i have witnessed, they are just plain evil to the kids for no reason other than they are kids.  be sure to bring a fat wallet. you don't get out of here cheap.oh my goodness. great vibe, great food, robust coffee. chill vibe, spacious, great place for meetings. highly recommend checking out this spot!why? just why does the music need to be blasted so loud like i'm in an 80's nightclub? thank goodness i had headphones but i could still hear it. i asked the cashier, with my fingers close together in a pinch gesture could the music be turned down just a teensy bit. she said "i guess we can turn it down a little. it's probably not as loud in the back." i explained that i was meeting someone who was already set up in the front. but guess what? i had already thought of that solution but i could still hear it back there so that's actually why i asked could they turn it down. i don't understand why the volume had to be so loud when most people were working or trying to have conversations. and a request, not to turn it off because that would be kinda ridiculous, but to turn it down just a little, was not even honored. i think atlantic starr or evelyn champagne king was playing just as loud if not louder as i sat there. ugh i used to like this place.nice space. staff are ok, some friendly some not. first time i went they apologized for taking so long. second time took really long too, but this time i got attitude for asking. i hope they fix the speed. i personally won't find out.this is a perfect little coffee spot with so much more to offer than just coffee. although there can be a wait it's sooo worth it for anything on their menu. their coffee selection is extensive, their smoothie options are great, but the best part are the milkshakes here. cannot recommend the oreo shake enough! it's a perfect blend of oreos and ice cream not making it overwhelming sweet. and the espresso milkshake comes in second best.this is one of my new favorite spots!  the coffee is good (i drink mine black) and the lox & bagel was really tasty!  the music was mellow and i was able to have a wonderful conversation with my friend.  i will definitely be back.  the atmosphere was beyond inviting!great coffee shop with a very authentic menu. the non coffee drinks are really refreshing and crisp. if you are looking to do work i highly suggest going here. they have a ton of space and uber friendly folks.tldr:- 2 stars off for sub par coffee.- 1 star off for pretentious barista.- 2 stars for being a local business and pricing. long story:i was driving by this place just after 7am and i wanted a cup of coffee so i tried looking inside and i didn't see anyone, and there was no open sign, so i parked and went in anyways. it was open. so i ordered a large mocha with an extra shot because their large mochas only come with 2 shots apparently. so i told the barista "hey you guys should think about getting an open sign, as i just saw someone else drive by slowly looking inside to see if you were open." barista replies, "no i don't think so. our regular customers know when we are open." i respond "it was just a suggestion"thanks for the pretentiousness, but if you want to run a business then you should make new customers feel welcome. this isn't a social club. if i had gone to starbucks instead at 7am you would know it was open because there would be so many people.finally i get the coffee and it tastes like chocolate milk. even though it's cheaper than starbucks you have to add enough espresso shots to make it more than starbucks. maybe he didn't put my extra shot, or any espresso at all. there was no other people there so that's not an excuse. maybe business is booming other times, but it wasn't looking so good when i went. i guess the starbucks at the hospital i work at will do.i'm not sure what the hype is about.  i got their latte and it tastes like coffee flavored milk.the food was good. but for $36 the portions were so small and not worth the price paid. the food was hot and made correctly. the best part of the meal was the over sized lemonade but this is not an experience i would pay for again.great little community coffee shop. love the vibes and the friendly staff. excited this is walking distance from home! :)this is probably my favorite place to eat in the area for a quick fix up and decent coffee. a bit pricey, but their sandwiches are awesome. especially their grilled cheese and bacon. perfect if you're in the area and need a quick bite. would give a 5, but the prices are to steep.they need to polish up on the customer service.... ordered online and they made the order incorrectly. tried to get it corrected but some guy claiming to be the owner was a real douche bag with zero people skills. the owner literally told me f-u-c-k you when i objected to his rude tone regarding an order they made incorrectly. he hung up in my face and i had to call 5 times to find out how to get my order correct, so i asked if i needed to come over there and he said he'd call the police and knows what my address is. he scolded me and said i need to listen to him. at that point i said to him you are clearly a racist. he kept saying i don't know what your race is and i said you are a white man and you know i am black and would never talk to a white customer this way. i finally got a refund from doordash after he refused to give the new dasher a remake of my order.... he told her i was an a-s-s-h-o-l-e and they were not remaking my order. i guess blacks who live south of his shop don't deserve customer service or respect. hey man don't let those ratings go to your head.... you can still go out of business if you keep being a jerk!i have always been wondering if there was any good coffee shop around the university of chicago.  back in january this year, my yelp elite friends, eva. s and jen b. (hi, girls) showed me this indie coffee shop passport.  robust coffee lounge in woodlawn was on the list.  i finally made it here with daddy j.  rcl technically isn't "on" campus, but it's south of uc border on the southwest corner of woodlawn and 63rd.  their coffee is reasonably-priced.  for $8 and some change, we had a large, bold, and wake-me-up americano and a large, mildly-spiced, calm-me-down diablo mocha.  i actually like this place a lot for these following reasons:1) free working wifi2) bright lighting through large windows3) plenty of seating for solo and group travelers4) friendly service 5) good selections of books, magazines, and newspapers they accept major credit cards (not sure about the minimum purchase).  it's also accessible via #63 bus (with a seasonal service east to the 63rd. st. beach).ok, now i'm done with the review.  it's time for me to space out at rcl...this is my first review in years! just moved to chicago and had to review this place.  the coffee is smooth and strong. the smoothie are made with honest to god real fruit (unlike some places i've noticed claim are made with real fruit but it's just syrup).  the coffee comes in xxl which is like a large soda at the movie theater.  yes ma'am sign me up!the food is great too with vegan/vegitarian options.this is my snow day destination!  cozy and friendly with a delicious assortment of sandwiches and baked goods.  hot coffee and delicious coffee drinks as well.love this coffee shop in woodlawn. breakfast sandwiches are perfect hangover food. the space is really creative and unique.i wrote one review sharing how disappointed i was in the breakfast bowl i ordered (5.17.16). since then, i found out that the advertising for the coffee shake is false. the sign says "cold brewed coffee, cinnamon, almond milk". the reality is that they use a coffee mix from a packet that contains tons of sugar, saturated fat, and preservatives. one serving is half the packet, but they put the whole packet in for one shake, meaning the calories start at about 500 just for the mix. the "cinnamon" is a syrup, adding more sugar to the drink.at least starbucks is honest about their ingredients for a comparable drink, the coffee frappucino. and, starbucks ingredients are better for my health. a coffee shop needs to serve real coffee. there's absolutely no excuse for using a cheap mix.robust coffee is lying to customers and lagging behind starbucks for coffee quality. i won't be going back, and am considering contacting the better business bureau regarding their misrepresentation of the product ingredients.i like this coffee lounge since my kiddo goes to school right next door. i also work in the area, so if the lines aren't very long i love to come in for a hot cup of dark roasted coffee and a pastry to go. it always smells amazing when you walk in. you aren't always greeted with a big smile but the service is always polite and accurate. the menu is just the right size, i hate large menus since i'm so indecisive, but they cover pretty much all the basics from sandwiches to shakes. the place itself always seems to be clean and organized. the environment is mixed, from folks coming in to have a quick business meeting to those just grabbing a snack while they wait for the bus. it's literally a gem for the woodlawn area. they also have the little stamp cards, so if you frequent often you can get a free drink! most small cafes don't offer this, but that's a perk that keeps me coming back. i love the 63rd turkey club, don't change a thing about it. i haven't been able to enjoy a lot of other options since i'm a busy mom and always on the go, but i can't wait to try their little breakfast bowl. i hate seeing people tear small business apart on yelp and other reviews sites. next time try speaking with the owner or manager first before trying to "hit them where it hurts". i'm a native of the hyde park/woodlawn area and have worked over here for years, in restaurants, business offices, you name it! small business owners are more likely to hear your opinion, even if they don't agree they will always hear you out and address any issues you may have. the owner is a very nice guy. :)this cafe has the worst customer service ever. my daughter purchased something to eat and was told to eat it outside. the employee here along with the owner talks to people as if we're nothing. thumbs downbeen coming here a couple of times per month. really liked it - great coffee choices and interesting and tasty sandwiches. a recent service experience put this place and its people at the top. was meeting someone to transact some biz. bought some items including a pound of blue heeler coffee. like a dope i took off without my bag of joe. i came back 10 days later, took a flyer and asked if they had it. snap snap the young lady retrieves it from the display case with a note on it "coming back for me". how great is that?! small things done right are so uplifting. thanks robust.great coffee teas and sandwiches! chill atmosphere too. moderate sandwich service speed though.i'm angry it took me so long to find out about this place! i had the breakfast bowl which was fresh and delicious. the vibe is very inviting and chic all while still being authentic to the neighborhood. i really enjoyed my breakfast and will def be back for dinner!good coffee and a decent place to work or meet. i think they would have decent food based on the coffee and what things looked like, but i didn't try anything. definitely next time i'm down there.love this place! food is great....coffee is even better. it's a great place to have a small meeting or come and catch up on reading/work. i have had the tuna melt and several breakfast sandwiches (it's an addiction ). the staff is friendly and it's clean.never. ever. coming back here. since i cant delete. here. 5 stars. my review is too short and yelp want to make it a tip to others.i come here a lot because of its proximity to my workplace--sometimes on the clock and sometimes not, depending. in the 25 or so times that i've been to robust, i've tried a lot of the menu and i have also had a lot of different interactions with different staff. i have not had a particularly consistent experience here, which is why i have held off on a review. i've had some five-star customer service experiences and some two-star customer dr vide experiences. i've had some five-star food and some two-star food. i'm going to focus instead on my overall experience, including the sum of 25 visits to robust. overall, robust is an excellent addition to the woodlawn community. it's located conveniently right on the corner and it's a meeting place for lifelong residents of the community, as well as university of chicago staff and students who want to venture a little off the beaten path off campus. uniform-clad school children can frequently be found here enjoying a snack or beverage after school hours. the diversity of customers at robust is great and adds to the welcoming atmosphere.the service can be hit or miss. some of the staff are incredibly kind, patient, and friendly, while others are fairly negligent and inattenive. my orders are messed up maybe 35% of the time, which is not the best. i have had my order forgotten more than a few times. sometimes, the staff are really apologetic and offer to give me extra flavor or a bigger size to compensate. sometimes, they barely bat an eyelash. i've tried maybe half of the menu items, including blended drinks like the oreo madness, smoothies like the almond milk, banana, chai, food items like the grilled cheese and hummus platter, the mocha diablo, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread latte, etc. so, why the four-star rating? at the end of the day, i know i can count on robust to be a cozy haven--a true gem in woodlawn. robust has a great atmosphere, acceptable drinks/food/prices, and (most importantly, for me) seating, outlets, and wifi. seriously, i have never not been able to find a seat or outlet here and that is the most important thing! i will continue to be a happy customer at robust as long as i work in woodlawn.had a bacon egg an cheese sandwich on a croissant it was hot and fresh love this neighborhood spot for quick fresh sandwich an coffeei'm in this area every few months, but i just noticed this cafe today. i was very impressed with the spaciousness and decor. it was very inviting and seems like a great place to so work or study. the staff were very friendly and accommodating. i had the infamous mocha diablo and i must say that the coffee was enjoyable and had a nice kick to it. i wasn't impressed with their glazed donut though; it was bland and had aftertaste. they had a large selection of donuts so i would bet that the other donuts taste better.i absolutely love this place! it is a hidden gem. the drinks are just perfect. the food is amazing! i love it when i get a chance to stop by here. the staff is super friendly and the vibe is just so chill and calm. what a great spot!stellar coffee and fast and kind customer service! everyone there is so incredibly nice. i love that the space is so large and there are different areas that all give off a different ambiance for however you are feeling. strong wifi, great music, nice lighting and a printing station too! the tuna melt and the 63rd street salad (because of the homemade ranch) were my favorites. this is definitely going to be a new favorite spot.today was my first time and i have the say the experience was very delightful. the cashier was very knowledgeable about their product. she gave me her opinion on what she like which i liked allot. the prices are reasonable to me and the atmosphere was peaceful.  my daughter and brother said they loved the favor lemonade, camel crunch to me was delicious, and my lox sandwich was great. i will definitely return. i recommend you try it .once, a long time ago and in a suburb far, far away, i accidentally put in about a teaspoon of honey in my newly-purchased dark roast coffee. i chalked this up to an "oops" and quickly grabbed the simple syrup bottle instead.so when robust coffee lounge comes along and intentionally sells me a "honey nut latte", you've caught my attention. and i wasn't sure if it was in a good way, or a bad way.short answer: in a good way. the honey and rich coffee work together really well, actually, with the flavors complementing each other and not conflicting. the "nut" part of the drink (probably almond syrup) was a nice touch, and i think that was what made the whole thing quite sweet. it's an excellent iced coffee, with a rich sweetness. and it was perfect for a post-run drink. it's a nice place to hang out in, to boot. woodlawn has a fine coffee shop in its borders.i went on a tuesday morning at about 10am. they had a steady flow of customers. when we were about to order someone came and told the cashier there was only one order of grits left. my daughter ordered the breakfast bowl, which includes grits. i wanted a bowl but ordered a sandwich. we also got banana bread french toast. she got an oreo drink and i got the mocha diablo. after waiting about ten minutes. someone comes to the table and tells us they are out of grits. so she changed to a sandwich. nobody mentioned refunding the difference. the oreo blended drink was underwhelming. the mocha diablo was very good. the banana bread french toast was ok. the breakfast sandwiches were ok. if you're looking to meet-up with someone or hang around on your laptop or phone it's a very nice laid-back spot. i was interested in food. maybe the lunch sandwich experience is better.the breakfast sandwich is amazing, i went there for the first time today and asked what they suggested usually when i ask what people suggest they suggest the pricey stuff on the menu. but when i robust they suggested on of the cheaper items and it was amazing they really know what there find i'm looking forward to coming backthe banana bread french toast is great!  i am also a huge fan of the egg, bacon, cheese, and avocado croissant.  during the busiest times, i have still never waited more than 10 minutes.  i am so happy to have this business in woodlawn!for someone who studies so close, it's a shame that i hadn't visited robust more often. this cafe is thankfully relatively not crowded and mostly devoid of students so it's a lovely escape from academia. it's a relatively small place but that adds to it's charm. numerous tables near outlets and free wifi make this an excellent place to do work beyond the confines of a library. it's a lot quieter than a starbucks, even with music playing, their coffee is excellent and decently priced. but lemme tell you about their rueben: a+. just the right amount of corned need and cabbage. so delicious. i'm actually sad that i have been living so long without it. if you're in the area, come on by. you won't regret it.in search of good coffee & in support of small business i came across this place! excited to try and be blown away by their robust coffee i was certainly blown away by the price . their small coffee only has 1 espresso shot where as other places i have visited there are 2 espresso shots which is why i had to pay extra for a small 12 oz coffee. the coffee was great the beans made a great vanilla latte. would i stop by again ... maybe not but if you're willing to pay 5 and some change for a small coffee then be my guest ! staff making the coffee was not very friendly i said thank you and have a good day and he just looked at me with dislike .despite having lived within walking distance to robust for the past year, i never made the short trek there to try it out before now. what a mistake! this spot has delicious food, plenty of seating, and fantastic music playing to liven up the atmosphere. this is a very sunny spot that is perfect for grabbing lunch with a friend or for studying. they have a great selection of sandwiches for lunch- i had the roast beef, which came on an onion roll and was very tasty! i can't wait to come back here again and try out the many yummy-looking pastries and cakes they have on display!i really like this place. the decor inside is really cool. the staff is friendly and the food is good! i like to go here, grab a bite and get some work done. it's a woodlawn area gem. -- only problem i've had was the nearby school let out and the students piled inside,and were rather noisy. not sure if that's a regular thing or only in the winter, nonetheless i'm still a customer.i love coming here to study but it seems like the bathroom is never clean. also the floor in the back part of the shop is really dirty. if it's not going to be cleaned everyday at least aim for every other day.what an awesome place.  the vibe there is always right.  they have a very strong and delicious menu too.  best of luck to derrick and jake!robust coffee is my favorite hyde park-area coffee shop. in order: 4. sip & savor3. bridgeport coffee2. greenline (woodlawn location)1. robust coffeetheir honey nut latte is delicious and i absolutely love the homemade biscuits and gravy, too.my goto morning coffee and donut shop! in the woodlawn community, mostly utilized by university of chicago students and staff. nice place to study, work, or read. staff members are friendly and invitingreally nice neighborhood spot for quick and tasty food and coffee. staff is extremely friendly and the place is clean and eclecticwhat a cool new place i happened to stumble upon! i loved the atmosphere of the place and the coffee and food is delicious too. i'm glad i found a great new coffee spot in the neighborhood. perfect place to come for breakfast or lunch or if you're a student it seems like a great place to study or hangout with your friends. i am most definitely coming back here whenever i can. we need more cool cafes in the area and robust helps! their menu is pretty diverse too i couldn't figure out what i wanted everything seemed so good, from sweet oreo waffles to a breakfast bowl and anything in between. i decided to build my own breakfast sandwich which was a sausage egg and cheese with avocado on a croissant roll, with a dark chocolate mocha to go with it. delicious! you will not be disappointed.i just had one of the worst customer service experiences. i placed an order over the phone for two breakfast sandwiches and a shake @ robust coffee lounge on 63rd and woodlawn. upon arrival i was informed that they don't take bills higher than $20. now see this is bs starts. the cashier goes and ask the (white) manager, owner, whatever he was if he could expect my c-note. he looks at me with this jacked up expression on his face then tells her no. i felt some kind of way about the look he gave me. then the cashier proceeds to inform me there's a gas station 4 blocks away where i could get change. to make a long story short. i come back and my food is cold, shake melted and i'm hot and pissed off not to mention now i have to wait in line. moral of the story is, if had been a doctor from up the street at the university with a lab coat on i bet it wouldn't have been a problem. nowhere in the establishment is it posted that they don't except large bills so how the hell can you not honor my cash. i will never set foot in this place again. don't get me wrong, i love their food but it's not worth the humiliation i received this morning.don't get me wrong i really like this coffee shop but the wait for food is excruciating ! if you're in a rush this is definitely not the place to go. however if you have time to kill you'll probably have an enjoyable experience...robust has a great selection of coffees, teas, refreshing beverages, and sandwiches (both breakfast and lunch). i was visiting my sister for a week and came here twice -- once to hang out and another time to sit and do work for a few hours. there is plenty of seating in the back room and the staff are very friendly. it's also a pretty affordable place for the quality you receive. i will be coming here for sure when i am in town.i went to robust for the first time this morning & the kids they have working the register is rude as hell!.. obviously they don't have any type of customer service. i went to starbucks earlier & ordered a drink there. on my way home my son mentioned he was hungry, so i went into robust & decided to order him a breakfast sandwich. i probably shouldn't have walked into the store with the starbucks cup but i was moving really fast. when i walked up to the register the girl rudely told me before i order i have to throw out my starbucks cup because it's a competitor. all the while a young guy stood next to her & stared at me in disgust. i told her i'm not sitting in & i just want to order to go, she rolled her eyes & said go ahead. i should've just left but seeing my child was hungry i just went ahead & spent $5.10 ( which was more than my coffee at starbucks). however i will never spend another dime in there again because even if you don't tolerate outside drinks/food in your establishment it need to be communicated in a customer friendly way. they acted as if i still wasn't spending my hard earned $ there.  i guess other coffee drinkers $ isn't wanted there. i actually worked at starbucks years ago & if someone walked to our register with a dunkin donuts cup we didn't refuse their service, what sense does that make?.. they might've wanted to drink dunkin donuts but their mate preferred starbucks. now if i would've attempted to sit at a table & eat my sandwich there with my starbucks drink then i can see the problem.i'm a fan.  good coffee, tasty sandwiches (i'm fond of breakfast sandwiches on challah), and without the hipster pretension of some other coffeeshops in the area.i once even dropped a check out of my wallet when i was there, and one of the folks working there went out of their way to find me.  it was like they viewed their customers as...people!the good:- the people behind the counter are fantastic and friendly. love them all!- great brand of coffee. - cool atmosphere- good location- comfortable- non-dairy milks available- nice selection of baked goods from a local bakery- coffee by-the-pound that they will grind for you- nice selection of smoothies- homemade "diablo" syrup is a sweet and spicy coffee flavour they make in house for the mocha diablo. - usually quiet,  free wifi! great to get some work done.- kid friendly, with a book shelf for reading in your down timethe bad:- non-dairy milks are all sweetened, which makes any fancy non-dairy latte too sweet after the flavouring is added.- a lot of the food is low quality pre-made mixes and packaged products (pancakes aren't fresh made batter, hummus is pre-packaged, the "cheese" is orange american style single slices,  breakfast condiments are just smucker's jams and pancake syrupetc. skip the food.)- blended cold drinks are made with a packet of pre-mixed artificially flavoured powders (yuck. just skip these entirely)- flavoured coffee syrups are cheap, teeth shatteringly sweet and give your latte a chemical taste. avoid the flavored coffees (with the exception of the homemade diablo syrup).i want to love robust, but i can't give 5 stars because they are lacking in quality and attention to detail. i'll keep going back though, because small local business support is important, and they're still miles better than dd or starbucks!i went here last week. i really liked the place! the coffee was very good. and the staff was incredibly nice! i highly recommend!delicious sandwiches with soft tasty bread and the best cup of coffee i have had in ages.looks like it could be a nice place but i wasn't pleased with the service....or lack thereof. we walked in to get drinks and ice cream and when i saw the menu i told my kids maybe we'd come in one day for breakfast. we stood at the counter and there was a girl making a drink. her hair was awesome but she glanced at us and said nothing. we stood around.  a guy came from the back and made eye contact, but said nothing. we stood around. the girl came over and stood there silently. no, "hello, may i help you?" nothing. my son wants to know if they have ice cream. "floats." he asks again. i try to explain that from her response i assume they only have vanilla ice cream and some sort of flavors of soda. she remains silent. he asks if they have cookies and cream. she shakes her head. ok, he'll take a cookie. i ask what the shaken lemonade is. it's lemonade with flavors. ok. we order a lemonade.  i ask how much the boxed water is (because it's fancy and people like to charge ridiculous prices for fancy stuff) she doesn't answer. ok. "so you want a cookie, a lemonade and a boxed water?" no, i wanted to know how much the water is. $2. no thanks. she fresh squeezed (awesome!) the lemonade for my daughter and hands it to me. we walk out and my daughter spits the lemonade out. it's bitter. unsweetened. why not mention that? we go back in for sugar.  maybe i asked too many questions. maybe i wanted more because i'd just run 3 miles or maybe it was because i kept seeing this place and saying i was going to stop in. whatever it was, i wasn't pleased with the service.  i've had a bad week dealing with ups and comcast, i want a smile and a hello at the local coffee shop, i guess.front end staff and servers are great. manager is unprofessional. sandwiches are great on some days and just "meh" on others. breakfast bowls are not good. restaurant is clean. nice ambiance.nice little coffee spot but i wasn't a fan of the london fog. honestly just tasted like warm milk and tea... their sandwiches look really great though.i have this problem where i can't try any other sandwich when i go there and keep getting the blt. it is so good. i think the fresh and perfectly toasted challah bread really makes it. plus the fresh lettuce & tomato and good mayo - lettuce - tomato ratio. perfectly cooked bacon. occasionally they skimp on the bacon and could use a little more but can't complain too much it's still yumzos. mocha is good. diablo is very spicy but good. donuts are ahh-mazing.the staff is personable and they gladly accommodate my culinary eccentricities such as the everything bagel with a hard fried egg, lettuce, onion and tomato with light basil cream cheese.  the "half-priced-after 5," freshly-made smoothies are a delight.  as they expand their offerings and space, they have assured me that they shall even better accommodate vegetarians.  we shall see.  in the meantime, i shall order my usual.where have i been? i live in the area and pass this location almost daily. great neighborhood spot for coffee and a light breakfast or lunch. i tried the carmel frappuccino and it was delicious. i also had a make it yourself breakfast sandwich. i'll be back!this is a gem tucked in the city of chicago. the honey nut latte tasted like honey nut cheerios. the sausage biscuit was on a real biscuit and was fantastic. hit this place up next time you are on the south side!this place is a hit or miss. let me start by saying that this place has very nice ambiance and the employees are usually courteous and polite. i usually go for there delicious breakfast sandwiches and nothing else. i've tried other menu items and i was left disappointed. their shakes and coffee drinks are diluted with a lot of milk, so save your money if you're thinking about purchasing these items. so don't set your expectations too high if you want real coffee drinks, robust doesn't have real baristas.this place beats the pants out of starbucks.  staff is very friendly and the decor is old school with industrial qualities. i would definitely suggest having a taste of the honey nut latte. this drink is an amazing warm, smooth, and just the right amount of love in a cup  to brighten any day.this place is close to where my sister lives, so we decided to get some coffee and breakfast here on a sunday morning. it was mostly empty when we arrived so we were able to order quickly. i had the robust breakfast bowl and my sister had biscuits and gravy. both hit the spot. the coffee was very good as well. what i like most is the atmosphere inside, it had a cool vibe and unique character. definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.the cappuccino could be better; was not as strong as we would have liked it to have been, though the way the establishment was designed distracted us from that. board games are shelved, and it is in fact an actual lounging spot. if you're looking for a place to study, or you're simply looking to get away for some peace of mind, i recommend stopping by.great place for studying. lots of room and everyone is super nice. their mocha is amazing. plus, the breakfast sandwich i ordered was made fresh. it was so good! my friend didn't love the mocha because she said it was too sweet, but i think a little sweetness it deserved with chocolate. she did love the apple donut though! i can't wait to return!super cute, wonderful debit always smells amazing, has an extensive menu of blended drinks as well as coffee drinks and teas, etc. came for lunch one day, got a blt didn't regret it. also they have free wifi. can't beat that.me and my boyfriend have been coming to this establishment for four months now and progressively worse. originally we fell in love with robust (63rd & woodlawn), but as time went on, the food was made with less care, brought out incorrect according to the receipt (twice), cold, and as of today, a 25 minute wait. what took the cake was what my boyfriend found in his sandwich, a rogue piece of paper. it seems as if it is a piece of deli or packing paper. that can happen to anyone, i understand. it's just  the staff this day was unapologetic. i'll probably stop by for a quick cup of coffee, but for food, that's a whole different story. side note:during the other mishaps the staff was quick to correct the problem. now, they seem unmotivated or even worse, disinterested in pleasing the customer.my favorite cafe in hyde park. i love the coffee and the cute interior. everyone is always friendly, i will continue to visit.everything here is good and made the way i like my food to taste! the grits aren't bland, the sandwiches are well balanced and the smoothies are delicious. the service is cool, i mean you don't feel like you are a part of the family lol but the prices are so reasonable for the great quality!also, the wifi is strong so it is a great place to work or study.i've been an avid fan of robust for years now. the drinks are cheap (or at least cheaper than starbucks) and i've never had a problem with my order. the sandwiches are great - my go to's are the sausage biscuit and the bbq betty. they run a variety of promotions ($5 sandwiches after a certain time, half price coffee at certain times) so check their fb page before you drop by.i've been here a couple of times. it's a great study space, as long as you don't come super early in the morning during the school year.  order the mocha diablo! also, while most people come for coffee and food, i would recommend trying their (mango) lemonade.got the grits breakfast bowl and a nutella strawberry cinnamon waffle and it was all just okay. tea with steamed milk was excellent. music when we arrived on a saturday morning was heavy metal. very kind staff changed it after i requested something more relaxing, but it slowly got more intense before it changed back to something relaxing again. a couple hours later it abruptly changed back to heavy metal so we left. overall: nice staff, forgettable food, good tea, and a nice space.a very solid neighborhood coffee shop with friendly staff and tasty food. good prices all the way around. i'm definitely sad that i don't live around the corner from them anymore. my only issue is that they are fairly slow with getting food out, which isn't great if you're on your way to work. they also don't use the highest quality ingredients in their breakfast items--very processed mixes, etc. but their sandwiches are great and reasonably priced.nice small place to get some coffee and baked goods. their sandwiches aren't bad either! definitely worth a try.i like the sandwiches. i like the coffee. i like the ambiance. i don't like the half ass, unbothered demeanor of some of the staff. p.s. don't ask to get your sandwich cut after they send it out. you will be directed to the plastic knives near the condiment stand. yes, i know i'm being petty. but it's the principle!quirky, independent local establishment that is great for coming with friends for unique breakfast combinations. whenever i'm in chicago my friends and i come here after mass. try the bacon waffles!i was disappointed in the service.  but i was even more disappointed that my blt had only one strip of bacon!!! like, how?! i've never seen anything like it before lol. i asked for another strip of bacon and was looked at like i was crazy lol. it seemed promising but after that i might stop in just for the coffee if i'm in the areahidden gem..old school coffee place .good place to come and relax on a rainy day and have a cup of coffeeit's okay for people who like being on lab tops and drink coffee all day ,more of a sandwich shop. ok but i doubt i'll come back. more yuppie style.the dark roast coffee is really good as is the food. the 63rd club comes on really nice bread, really bumps the sandwich into another category. staff is always friendly. plus it's close by, so that always helps.robust coffee lounge just makes me happy.  what doesn't make me happy is how far it is from where i live.   i can assure you that i would likely have a new line item in my monthly budget if this place was in my neighborhood.  5 reasons why robust rocks:1. excellent coffee - alterra beans roasted in milwaukee.  smooth and delicious!2. great food - i enjoyed an superb make-your-own breakfast sandwich (egg white, turkey, cheese on challah)3. lemonade - i watched them freshly squeeze the lemons that would become my mango lemonade.  so good!4.  outstanding decor and atmosphere.  seriously, i love it.  i want my dining room to look like it.  5. friendly staff with personality.  thank you!don't pass up on this coffee house gem in south chicago.today was the worst experience i've had in coming here (been a loyal customer for over a year)! up until 3 days ago, i hadn't tried the pancakes but they were delicious! the best i'd had in a long time - light in color and in texture, flavorful, golden and the size of the entire plate, almost.today, however, after 2 attempts i received smaller cakes that were black/dark brown (crisp on the edges) and not flavorful - along with an irritated look at the employee that had to take them back. i didn't even eat the second batch because i was so irritated that i drove all the way from the south loop just to have these either those delicious golden pancakes again or a golden waffle. i was sooooo upset about leaving there hungry - having to stop somewhere else after passing up the pancake house and chicken and waffles. total waste of money, gas and time today.it's a hidden gem! really nice on the inside and very spacious. the food is quite tasty especially for a coffee shop. definitely recommend giving it a try.hands down one of the best coffee shops in the city, right up there with dollop. the coffee is great, the food smells delicious, though i've yet to taste any of the cuisine. the atmosphere is very trendy, but manages to still feel very south side. there are plenty of outlets and seats, although the few times i went, the available seating was limited to the area by the door, because the lounge area was pretty packed.  when i was growing up down the street, i would never have imagined a place this cool and diverse venturing outside of the hyde park/ u of c area, but i'm glad they did.i called four times to order a sandwich.   i couldn't get through.   when i arrived and ordered i was told i should have called.  simple sandwich took a long time like 15 minutes.   the manager told me i should ve called ugh...poor slow service.quite a nice place - the atmosphere is humming but not noisy, which is the kind of ambiance i like when i'm doing work.i tried the bbq lou and the herbie. the former was a winner - brisket was delicious and the coleslaw and bun were the perfect accompaniment. bonus: they give you little tootsie rolls/pops with your meal!the herbie, on the other hand, wasn't my favorite - the sandwich was basically a huge scoop of (really bland) chicken salad with some lettuce and bacon. the pumpernickel bread it came on was pretty good, but i wouldn't recommend the sandwich as a whole.i also had a chai latte, which was nice if a little on the bland side as well. while the flavor of the chai was good, it felt like the chai to milk ratio was a little low. i still enjoyed it enough that i would order it again, though.boyfriend had two of the smoothies: the hawaiian dream and the sunrise. i snuck a little of each - the former was my favorite of the two.overall, definitely worth the trip, and a nice place to get some studying done.i tried their "special" biscuits with sausage gravy but unfortunately, it was far from special. unless all that paprika they sprinkled on top was suppose to make it special and not taste like paprika. the biscuits were good and were the highlight. the gravy barely had any sausage in it. the staff and atmosphere were just ok.let's see..i loved the little atmosphere it had, not bland at all. smelled like coffee and eggs! i loved that part.i decided to make my own sandwich. i made a croissant sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich. the sad part that made this place lose points was that the bread was very dry.the coffee? now that was good. good strong roast with some caramel i added.i really want to love robust.  i do.  but i suspect much of the reason people love robust is that there is no good alternative in the area -- it is just a sad fact of life that (due to understandable neighborhood/demand/business/etc. considerations) the vast majority of the good coffeeshops are up north.  that said, i have two independent observations about robust.first is that the interior layout could be better. the space doesn't seem to be used in the best way, though i can't put my finger on why it feels this way. there are a number of individual-size tables that are good for people who are there to work on laptops, but many of those are inaccessible to outlets, and the ones by the windows in the front are somehow unappealing -- maybe due to rickety unstable chairs, and maybe just that the tables/area never seems to be clean. that leads me to my second observation, which is that i always get the feeling the surfaces/tables/floor/etc. are kind of dirty.  i'm not at all a clean freak.  but it just doesn't make me want to stay when i usually have to wipe down my table myself before i put my computer down, and there are often pieces of used equal packets, etc. laying around the milk/sugar table. if the coffee were somehow exceptional, neither of these things would matter so much. but the coffee is just average for any intelligentsia location.  i go to robust when i have to be on campus immediately afterward, and that's about it.  i know robust is trying to be this swanky coffee lounge in a neighborhood that hasn't really had that, but if that's the case, the maintenance/upkeep has to be like that of a swanky coffee lounge.i work on the southside of chicago and needed a place to get some work done in between commitments.  my friend recommended that i try out robust instead of the usual starbucks.  their claim to fame is apparently the mochadiablo, which was described to me as a mocha with habenaro sauce, so i of course, had to try it.  the spiciness was on the mild side, even for a coffree, and wasn't anything special.  i thought it was overpriced, even for a special coffee.  they have a lot of outlets around the perimeter of the shop, which makes it a good place to work.  i'd go back here again, but the coffee isn't anything to write home about.nice place! had the bbq betty. it was suppose to be on a pretzel bun, they were out of them so i was offered an onion roll. i must say it was tasty but every bite i wished i had that pretzel bun.  also got a piece of carmel cake that was huge, tasted average and was $5, ugh. seems like a great place to escape and get some work done, or  study. nothing else really around it in walking distance.when this place first opened it was the best. high quality and great service. it really has gone down in quality and the service is really lacking now. the fresh squeezed lemonade often tastes too bitter, their pineapple green tea is too acidic, the croissants are now just heavy buns, donuts are hard and dry on several occasions. went to get a english muffin there the other day and asked for it toasted, it came out rubbery and soft. sent it back twice and then just gave up, threw it out and went elsewhere. my brothers went there the other day and even their specialty sandwich, bbq betty, was dry and not delicious anymore. i'm sad. really loved this place for the first year or two. not worth it anymore.i'm not saying they have the best food ever -- indeed, the sandwiches are a little simple and a little bland -- but there is something so delightfully *earnest* about this place.  the space is bright, lively, and welcoming; the service is friendly; they make their own soup.  and in it is in a little corner of south hyde park that desperately needs something welcoming and earnest.  i've lived in chicago for less than two months and i've already been here three times.the service here sucks! i've popped in a few times and almost always made to feel like an inconvenience. don't expect a "hello", "good morning ", a smile or even eye contact, it more than likely won't happen here. this morning i needed coffee and stopped by...i noticed flies in the donut/danish glass area...i left. the one star is for the pleasant afternoon staff...i've been to robust in woodlawn a few times when visiting my sister at university of chicago. while the food can be a bit inconsistent at times, overall i've left really satisfied. coffee is fantastic. vibes are egalitarian and academic. i'd say this is one of the few places in and around u chicago that local residents and students genuinely interact. staff has always been very friendly and accommodating.i used to really love going to this place...my last three visits they gave me the wrong order after waiting for 15 minutes and then i had to wait another 15 minutes to get my order right. needless to say, my hot chocolate or should i say hot milk got cold. i used to love their hot chocolate, but now they add a drop of chocolate sauce for any size and all i have is a cup of milk. i have to go out of my way to get to this place and i am disappointed. the plain bagels with cream cheese are still good, but this will be my last time going there...
