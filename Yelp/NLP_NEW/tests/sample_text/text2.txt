The coffee I drank today brought hope.  The proceeds of "Hope Cafe," near the southwest corner of Western and Roosevelt, help fund the Chicago Hope Academy.  I recently purchased their Groupon and have been wanting to check this place out.  

The building where the coffee shop took is an 1800's historic landmark and a 1900's speakeasy bar.  It could tell some parts of the building were antiquated, yet the space was open, cozy, and available for party rentals.  They have the full coffee menu: drip coffee, Americano, latte, mocha, red eye, and etc., with some "cafe-style" sandwiches that are made to order.  

The prices were pretty reasonable, especially after the Groupon discount ($3 off).  The people who work there were great.  While I was waiting for my order, I googled a few Bible verses that appeared on the walls (Galatians 6:9; Philippians 4:10).  There were my spiritual pick-me-up of the day.  

The only thing that held me back on rendering the full score was the malfunction of the women's restroom lock.  I wasn't able to lock the door.  Fortunately, one would be capable of pulling the door while conducting her business.  I didn't want to be too descriptive on it, and I believe the staff was aware of this flaw and perhaps it was in the process of repairing it.  

Although the Groupon gives me the incentive to come back here, I won't hesitate to patronize a business that serves up genuine coffee for a good cause.
