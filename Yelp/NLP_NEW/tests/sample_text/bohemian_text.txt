cozy neighborhood spot for a good coffee and yummy sandwiches. we stopped in for a few hours to work and the wifi, the sound level and light was perfect for getting things done. if you're nice to the barista, they may make you a fun latte with funky art on it, and their latte flavors range from standard to different. the lavender one was lovely and the spicy one had just the right touch of heat. we got one of the sandwiches after a while and it came with veggie chips on a plate that looked like a painter's palette, which was fun. and the sandwich was fresh and tasty.i thought this cafe was okay. i got the matcha latte (iced) and felt like i was just drinking light green milk. it didn't seem to have too much flavor (not terribly sweet, and the matcha flavor wasn't that strong).the latte art for their hot drinks was cool though. almost looked like a honey comb of sorts. i've never seen that at any other coffee shop and i've been to a lot!the ambiance was okay. our table was a bit wobbly so it was hard to work on for long periods of time. the lighting was mostly from the window, but it was a bit overcast that day so it wasn't extremely bright.cute cafe that made a nice strong cortado. friendly staff and great looking sandwich menugood neighborhood place for breakfast sandwiches and nice place to sit for a while. the prices are bit high though, and it's difficult to find a spot on the regular because the space is small and customers park for a long time to use wifi.big fan of this place! love the kahlo breakfast burrito. i also like the iced mocha and coldbrewgreat way to cool down after a walk along 606 is to have an iced tea from gallery cafe. their staff is cheerful and helpful, the artistic and laid back vibe also adds to the charm of the place. free wifi and they hold events.superb little cafe. great atmosphere and the kahlo breakfast burrito (add sausage) is amazing! will be back to try more of their breakfast and lunch offerings.honestly, i'm surprised by the reviews. i typically only order plain coffee at coffee shops. this time was no different, so i can't speak to their specialty drinks. however, the dark roast drip coffee was superb.some coffee shops are pretentious. the gallery cafe isn't one of them. it's a chill, cozy environment. good energy. the staff was attentive. when i walked in, i was asked to wait for a moment. i didn't mind. i appreciated the communication. the staff member who waited on me was a quirky guy. i'm a little quirky, too. great! the menu said that high fives were free with purchase. i wasn't going to pass up that opportunity. i paid, then asked the barista for my high five. he completely understood and proceeded to lift his hand about head height. i then proceeded through with a high five motion. i think it was a good high five. i can't speak for the barista's experience. the price was fair. i sat in the shop so i went ahead and paid for a coffee refill with my original purchase. the barista applauded my proactive method which made me feel like i could really tackle the day. thanks for that.overall, good experience. i was pleasantly surprised but not necessarily wowed. the tile floor and bathroom decor could use an update, but hey, the energy was on fleek. thank you gallery cafe. you made my day a little better. i'll return the favor my donating a high five to someone in need.cozy cafe with friendly service.  dropped in for a quick bite on a weekday and tried the rodin sandwich (chicken, bacon, avocado and more) served with chips...will be back!  crowd at noon on a monday was small, a handful of people talking, working, or in my case enjoying my food while people watching our the window.  a steady stream continued to come through for coffee.rad little neighborhood coffee shop with a decent collection of artists and thinkers that frequent it. my favorite drink is the rothko; the claudel is pretty spicy so be warned if that's not your style. i've been known to frequent this spot for the coffee, the conversations and the local art/music events.i really liked the folks working here.  they were pleasant and made my first trip a nice experience.  not to bash the great vibe, but my sandwich--the klimt--was not very filling.  it was ok but underwhelming, both in portion and just the general taste.  it was also a tad pricey, as were a lot of their sandwiches.  the glass plates resembling artist palettes were cute, but the rest of the place felt more student lounge and less quaint cafe.  that's not a bad thing, just an observation.power monkey smoothie, the klimt sandwich, art and the staff = a perfect day and watch the coffee beans roast right in front of your eyes. gc rocks my world!this is such a cute spot! i stopped by with a rather large group to get some work done and the location and spot was perfect. cute set up , great service, and awesome place to work. i had already eaten that day, but i went with the blueberry tea. yummy! i'm not a fan of coffee so can't give you much insight into that, but everyone else seemed to be enjoying it. next time i stop by i'll try out their sandwiches. the girl next to me had one and i was eyeing it. :)wonderful service along with great coffee how can you beat that!  and i really love that they serve the wonderful nearby kitty cat cafe!this place is a great location for studying! also, they seem to have some amazing artwork hanging around that adds to the relaxing environment. the owner geno is super friendly, and he is super passionate about his coffee selection!i usually come here and the service is great but last time i came i ordered my usual and was waiting for about 17 minutes after that i asked the lady if they have started on my order and just answered "omg" come to find out they forgot about my order had to get my money back and gave me a few free coffee coupons but i don't even drink coffee came for a smoothie today and it's taste was a little off .great coffee roasts! we use gallery as our roasters for our office and they provide great service and the coffee tastes great. its nice to have a local coffee versus ordering from larger company.the cafe looks and feels stale. the service isn't awful but is a little too snotty for comfort. the coffee is alright and the sandwiches, while they taste good, seem a bit light for what you're paying. i never feel comfortable hanging out here for any amount of time.it's not a horrible experience coming here but the vibe here is always kind of poor and i'd rather go down to milwaukee avenue and drink coffee at one of the places there.i absolutely love gallery cafe! always have good coffee drinks, the donuts are amazing!!  they also have really good lunch menu items vegan muffins and good options for smoothies!  always my go to cafe in wicker park. if you're an artist of any sort come support local artists since they donate to aspiring artists!i think i'm the only person that comes to this coffee shop for the smoothies, but they're legit! made with 100% fruit, they're my personal favorite on the menu.i've had the coffee before and i think it's a little too bitter. also, it's always extremely hot in here, not sure if the air is broken or what's going on. 3 stars for a decent ambiance with no frills but no complaints either.the staff here are always such a pleasure and their smoothies are simple and delicious. perfect for a quick and simple bite to eat as well. also a great place to bring your laptop and chill while getting some work done or just hanging out.i love local coffee shops and got to try this quaint spot. definitely unique with the art work on the wall. seating is mildly uncomfortable, i wouldn't sit here for more than 4 hours doing my work. also, it was pretty cold, i didn't even sit by the door, but with people coming in and out, heat was hard to regulate. their assortment of tea was a plus!! i couldn't even decide on which one to have (well, i am indecisive from the beginning) but still, lots of good tea to choose fromi just recently hosted an event at gallery cafe and loved every bit of my experience there. geno is so nice and accommodating and the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. the atmosphere was perfect for my meetup for about 25 guests. everyone at the event complimented all of the artwork, the taste of the coffee (seriously, that turtle latte is the truth!) and the overall relaxed vibe. geno and his staff went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable, fully caffeinated and that we were enjoying ourselves. seriously, one of the best cafe's in the city!the place has greatly improved ever since new management took over! creative atmosphere with local artists' pieces featured on the walls for sale and succulents at all the tables, delicious food and drinks for $5, strong wifi, great music, big windows make for lots of natural light and a view for people-watching :)i've been there a total of three times and every time my coffee tasted like an ashtray. not only the coffee is terrible, the service is even worse. the owner is rude and incompetent. the last time i was the only person at the shop and i had to repeat 4 times that i wanted a vanilla biscotti, not chocolate, for which i got an eye roll as though my order was a huge bother to her. ps also there is a $5 min on debit/credit cards. considering a coffee there is under $5, it always forces you to buy something else.awesome spot for the early bird. wonderful art on the walls and great service - you may sit outside too.  thumbs up. great latte and menuthis place is such a gem! both the coffee and the people are wonderful. the breakfast sandwiches are my favorite - very filling and large portions. most of all, the vibes are super chill and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. i love that they support artists and musicians, and they are continuously engaged with the local community. highly recommend!eh probably won't come back, the employees were very kind, so they get a  4 star review, but the latte was awful, espresso is supposed to be a little sweet and slightly bitter the milk foamy and creamy. this espresso tasted of cleaner and burnt. i don't know if it was burnt in roasting or what but i don't think it was done well at all. because after the third remake of the drink it was bad. try changing out the beans or something? the sandwich was just bland, not a lot of flavor and when you see avocado expect the worlds smallest smear if the stuff. i just wish it had something more to it, or even just more avocado. i don't think i will make an effort to go back in to the gallery cafe, which is sad because i was so excited to finally try this place. oh well, i guess there are people who like it or it wouldn't be in business. well on to the next coffee shop i guess.the staff here are passionate and knowledgeable about the coffee they roast in-house and serve! not to mention they are super accommodating, and friendly. it's super awesome to see the roaster at work, and it gives off a delightful smell. the coffee and the smoothies at gallery are really delicious, and so are the pastries, which are made locally! there's a lot of great art covering the walls as well making it a cozy and cool place to hang out and do work. the location of the cafe is also super accessible. there's a bus stop right in front and is only a couple blocks away from the blue line!i love the gallery cafe.  its the perfect stop for a quick bite or coffee.  i work across the street, and gallery cafe gets me caffeinated and ready to go for the day!  try their power monkey (its too good!)solid coffee shop if you need to get some work done and want a killer breakfast sandwich. everyone who works here is sweet, wifi is strong, and overall it's a cozy atmosphere.good drinks, very expensive. paid $15 for a small wrap ( which was advertised to come with chips and did not) and a double cappuccino. the wrap was good but not anything to rave aboutcome for the breakfast sandwiches, they are fresh and have some of the fluffiest, most delicious eggs i've ever purchased. consistently great breakfast sandwiches, with healthy options and whole grain bread on the menu.the selection of pastries and random assorted garbage is lacking, which is fine by me. decent cold beverage selection. ambiance not quite as cozy or comfortable as some coffee shops. they recently added a bit more art to conform to their name. overall, this is a go to spot for me and just close enough that i go out of the way to get to it.go there for the sandwiches. i've only had the drip coffee which is fine, does the job. the breakfast sandwiches though. fantastic. fresh eggs, delicious bacon, on whatever bread you want. the focaccia was fresh and was great with the davinci sandwich.another pro, it's not a cluster like so many other places in the neighborhood. if you're not looking for the full wicker park brunch experience and just want a good old fashioned cafe experience, then this is it for you.the location was good, since there was really no other alternatives around. i was happy they had different choices of milks (including almond and coconut.) the only bummer was that they had a delicious sounding coffee shake on the menu, but they couldn't make it because they were out of bananas. suggest taking it off the board if you can't make it, so we are disappointed ;). also love that you have rx bars, maybe add a few more flavors ;)this place has a great vibe....owner was extremely cordial and went above and beyond with customer service! give it a try and you will take home more than a cup of coffee. great experience!under new management and seeing some nice changes. coffee is good and love looking at the local art displayed on the walls. it's a nice place to zone out and enjoy a cup of joe!love the feel of this place. food was great. coffee was better. everyone was super friendly. the owner really knows his stuff. talked to me about the difference between beans, their flavors and where there from. i recommend this spot to anyone who appreciates a lowkey setting, great affordable coffee, dope music selection and inspiring local art.every time i come to chicago the gallery cafe is on my "must stop" list. i've had coffee all over chicago including the premium price, ultra trendy hotspots. you name the brand or the coffee shop and i bet i've had it or been there. i don't do lattes or barista required concoctions. i want dark roast straight up black. and no one does it better than the gallery. especially for the price. proves that the quality of the coffee isn't measured by what you paid for it. they have great sandwiches and wraps - i'm particularly fond of the breakfast sandwich selections, all named after a famous painter. outstanding. for a small place, they really serve it up huge.went into for the first time today. wasn't super impressed. i tried the iced coffee. the barista told me they just pour hot coffee and espresso over ice. not terrible but definitely not a cold press. i'd be willing to try a latte if i stop in again. atmosphere is pretty normal for a neighborhood shop. any place that roasts their own beans can't be too terrible.prices aren't bad either. i paid less than three bucks for an iced coffee with caramel.super close to my house so it's really convenient. coffee is always on point and consistent and the staff is lovely!food is ok, but the hipsters behind the bar don't understand the concept of decorum and treat (more like mistreat) the customers based on their piss poor mood, apparently. if you want a wrap and a sandwich, there are plenty of other options down the street.two stars, according to yelp, means "meh.  i've experienced better."  that is totally correct for gallery cafe.  it is average at best.  our fair city has many awesome coffee places, and gallery is far from awesome.  i think the problem actually may be the cups ... since our coffee tasted like the dumb cup.skip gallery and walk to plenty of other great coffee places in the neighborhood.106/365super cute little coffee shop! quirky local art, fun music, super nice barista. great selection of drinks & food. everything is made fresh & to order. i got a dirty chai - smoothest latte i've had, maybe ever. not a place to stop in if you're in a rush in the morning - only one person was working & it took a while to get my latte because the customer ahead of me ordered a sandwich. i'll be back on a weekend & see how the food is - it smelled awesome!the creative menu is the best part of this place. each dish is named after a famous artist: it's quite clever.the coffee was delicious, and the service relatively prompt. however, the food was very mediocre. my breakfast sandwich took way too long for a simple avocado and eggs on french roll. i've gotten better breakfast sandwiches at einstein bros. bagels. nice place though, good atmosphere.as both a featured artist at gallery cafe, and a customer i can only find positive things to say about this establishment.  ive had the pleasure of not only getting to know one of the owners, eugene (who was incredibly warm and professional), but i've also had the supreme pleasure of enjoying their hot chai tea lattes on many a cold chicago day. both experiences were wonderful, especially while being surrounded by the beautiful work by local artists, and cozy atmosphere. great place to read and enjoy a latte, or grab lunch with a friend. and you don't want to miss their monthly "meet and greet" with the shown artists. definitely a favorite chicago spot.i absolutely love this place! i work down the street, and spend almost 90% of my mornings stumbling into this place for a latte. all of the staff is friendly, knowledgable about coffee (that matters), and they are more than willing to go the extra mile to ensure your beverage, sandwich, or pastry is satisfactory. one time the manager went down the basement to grab me a drink holder for two coffees. i am shocked this place has such a poor rating on yelp. drink prices are on par with, if not cheaper than, a certain chain coffee shop located at milwaukee/damen/north and it makes me happy knowing my money is going to a local business owner. furthermore, the food is delicious and the sandwiches are all prepared fresh before your eyes and served with chips. local art is for sale on the wall and free wifi is accessible. this is definitely a place in the neighborhood to support.stopped by to grab a quick early morning coffee before heading to damen north dental across the street. even though getting coffee before seeing the dentist is counter intuitive, i'm going to make this a regular pre-dentist stop. the service was quick and the seating was plenty. the place is a little divey so i'm not sure if i would trust the food but the coffee was excellent.i live right around the corner from gallery cafe and decided to give this place a shot.  their coffee is amazing, one of the best i've had.  i decided to try one of their breakfast sandwiches one day and ordered the davinci.  pure bliss.  i ordered it with turkey sausage, pepperjack cheese, and tomato bread. their wifi is reliable and fast.  they have plenty of tables and outlets for you to work on, and if coffee refills are only .50! i could stay there all day and work, it's a nice cozy setting and the staff never pressures you to leave.  they mind their own business and let you do yo thang!only reason i gave it a 5 star is because it's a little too hipster for me, but it's all good in the hood.pretty cool place. they roast the beans in house so the coffee is good and the sandwiches are a total treat. no dogs allowed inside but there are dog treats by the door, cute. #localarti was drawn in by the clever looking sign and decided to stop for coffee thinking "oh cool, i'll get to check out some art while i'm here".  upon entry though i immediately noticed that for a place called gallery cafe... they have almost no artwork... lots of space for art, but no actual art. i noticed a total of 4 paintings and they weren't very good even in an ironic way. i noticed the sandwiches were named after famous artists but i'm sure they'd wonder why. the general design was relatively unspectacular and not very hip. they had bananas in a bucket that i wouldn't have eaten if they were free but the house labeled coffee itself was surprisingly delicious.... i drink it black so i was excited about that. it is self serve, $2 for a medium with 50 cent refills. the music was very blah: 60s pop hits....this place may be nice in the summer with its outdoor patio facing north ave... but i wasn't wowed and most likely will not return.i have seen this spot numerous times and it never occured to me to enter (that's what curb appeal will do...).in any case, i was in the need of a quick lunch, so this seemed like a good spot.  so, the food itself was pretty good if you like microwaved eggs.  i ordered an egg/cheese/avocado sandwich on a bagel.  i was watching her make the sandwich and i was extremely confused as avocado normally doesn't take elbow grease to get out of the container...she seemed to really be struggling.  was it frozen?  i'll never know...the eggs were definitely microwaved, but i guess that's what i get for a quick sandwich.  even with these oddities, the food was pretty good - hot and the cheese was melty.  however, my main complaint is that this spot is s  l   o   w.....  there is no reason this sandwich had to take so long to make.  i maybe should have guessed since the person taking the order seemed confused and then the woman making my sandwich was staring at the ingredients in a fog.  i was ordering to go...the group in front of me ordered to eat in.  i think they ordered some sandwiches...mine, even though i waited for what seemed like 30 min came out first!  my coffee also came out first before the group ahead of me.  they must have been extra annoyed with their wait.  in any case, the food was ok, but not really the home cooked lunch i was looking for and the service is so off that i'm not sure i want to return any time soon.one type of establishment that really should strive to be open on time is a coffee shop. yelp says open at 6:00. sign on the door says 7:00. all i know is at 7:15 on a friday it was pitch black inside. i was one of three people to walk up to the door in the couple minutes i was nearby. oh well.this is a great place to hang out and get coffee! the staff is so friendly and i love their dog-friendly outdoor patio where you can people watch on north ave! they do an amazing job supporting local artists and have great events in the evenings! definitely one of my favorite coffee shops in chicago.just stopped in and bought a coffee and muffin to go. i can only imagine how long that muffin had been sitting there before i bought it, because it was hard as a rock. i'm not exaggerating, my coworker and i spent 5 minutes trying to slice into it with a butter knife just to see if it was possible...it was not.maybe i'll try this place again in a month or two so i can buy something that was made today.warning before reading on: unfortunately i didn't get to try any of the coffee drinks here so this review is mostly for their ambiance and rice krispy treat!  like another reviewer said, this little coffee place flies under the radar and is very unsuspecting.  i think i've driven and walked by this place plenty of times without going in.  but i finally tried it while waiting for my order from puptection across the street.  i loved the funky hippy vibe of the place with the menu scrawled in different colored chalk, large floor to ceiling windows, funky art, and a few tables and booths scattered throughout.  the rice krispie treat i got here was tasty and their breakfast and sandwich menu sounded really good, i'll have to try those another time.  staff was ok-not super friendly but definitely not unfriendly.  the one thing i didn't dig so much is that there was a "gandhi" sandwich which i really think does not do justice to who he was.  naming a sandwich after one of our world peace leaders just doesn't seem right to me.  i was seated by the windows and was disappointed to see that there were no outlets near where i was--i'd have to get up and move tables to plug in my dying laptop, but by then i had to bounce anyway so it didn't affect this visit.  if i did want to stay for a couple of hours though i'd make sure you found a table near an outlet.honestly, the best cup of regular coffee in town. and i enjoy smelling them roasting the beans, since i live so close. the sandwiches are also very good and great variety. the interior is just lacking comfort.my favorite local spot for coffee. they have great sandwiches for lunch too.   some outdoor seating when the weather is warm! be warned they close a little on the early side - 5pm.really cool staff, nice easy going vibe, big lack of hipster attitude (shame you can't do anything about the hipster *customers*, of course).  it would have been an easy 5 star review but felt the coffee was just slightly bitter.  strong and fast wi-fi though - you guys are just about almost there!just kinda meh.  got a biscotti, and it was hard as a rock.may favorite place to study or chill. since the new owners took over, the place has totally improved. coffee and espresso tastes great now, waaay better. there is always new cool artwork on the walls now. and i guess they have an art night for kids and adults. my favorite local coffee shop.been here many times as its just down the street, so i know their menu and coffee well. i mostly prefer to get their coffee which they let you pour your own and make to each individuals specifications. usually two good choices, one always being the house blend. today went with just an egg breakfast sandwich, the varo, which i chose due to the jalapeño peppers. wile i would have preferred more of these, you can't beat the taste and the quality of the handmade sandwich. i got mine on a pretzel roll with pepper jack cheese. they offer many varieties of sandwiches and have a nice outdoor patio for those wanting to linger around. i always come back for the cheap coffee and is truly what a local coffee shop should be.this place has so much potential!i've been here over the years and seen it change, go through employees (always a steadfast tall lanky blond man who had the best service), sadly most of employees who were by far the best are long gone. the food is ok, i would not order anything with meat in it, but in a jam its affordable and if you keep it vegg. your fine!the coffee is sub-par, nothing special, the espresso is often burnti've dealt with the owner krista several times there, she' seemed very disinterested in the prosperity of the place and generally seemed to also dislike her employees a lot too. this place is ok at bestactually, a 1 1/2. i had a delivery, which cost additional coins. keep this in mind. i ordered a davinci: eggs, bacon, tomato and cheese on a bagel. under special instructions i asked for the bagel toasted with butter, and the bacon crispy. not too high maintenance. what i got was an un-toasted bagel and fatty, undercooked bacon, and, wait for it, green eggs. yup the eggs were green. inedible. threw it out.coffee was fine (had a latte; asked for vanilla, it came without -- they charged for what i asked for); the banana nut muffin was ok (but glad to have it since my sandwich got put in the garbage. the smoothie is in the fridge because i simply couldn't handle any more disappointment.what a waste of a bastille day breakfast and a bunch of coins. the delivery guy was nice though. never again.this place has amazing coffee and exellent breakfast sammys.  the manet is my fave (eggs, provolone, and pesto) there is something special about the way they make the eggs, cant describe it.  i am giving it 4 stars because 80% of the time it takes forever to order, as well as get your food...even when there's only a few people there.also they always have different artwork up on the walls when i go in, which is a nice concept, but i have never been super impressed by it.grunge.  the staff was a little rough, you have to jump through loops to get to use the restroom - and the restroom was pretty nasty.  the honey bottle was clogged and covered in honey...seemed pretty par for the course.if i could give negative stars, i would. the staff are snobby and pretentious hipsters who all seem to have serious attitude problems. the girl i encountered actually made me feel that i was an inconvenience to her!! there is a minimum on credit cards, which is against visa policy rules on their website.the food is terrible, and the coffee is even worse. my friend ordered the hummus and vegetables and got a paper plate with gross-looking hummus and small squared of chopped vegetables .. how do you even dip that in the hummus?terrible! do not come here!!i had some time to kill and needed wifi so i popped in here for a coffee and some breakfast.  the wifi was reliable and fast but the music was so loud that it made it a bit hard to concentrate - especially for a saturday morning at 9am.  the bagel sandwiches looked inviting so i tried the gauguin with tomatoes.  the bagel was barely toasted and the cream cheese was barely there.  between the bland attitude staff and the even blander decor, i'll opt for the place across the street next time.i randomly walked by here when i was hungry and ahd a few mins to spare so i stopped in.  i ordered a veggie sandwich and it was really good and they take ccs which isn't entirely typical of the more hipsterish places in chicago.  i did notice a slight hipster attitude surrounding the service which is fine by me, but i definitely would understand if it rubbed others the wrong way.i'm so disappointed to read the negative reviews of the gallery cafe!  we live right near here and frequent it.  they have the best coffee - their house is my favorite.  the scones and muffins are fresh and delicious.  i also enjoy the breakfast sandwiches - yes, the wait can be a little longer than you'd wait at say dunkin' donuts or something, but who cares?  and the eggs aren't scrambled to order - but if you want that go to a sit down brunch place.  i've never had anything but a positive experience here and great service. the coffee is killer - i get it at least once a week.got a delicious coffee there, but jesus the service was dour!  i mean, how can you sell coffee and...clearly not drink it yourself?  oh so gloomy! i also got a piece of pumpkin bread, which i should have looked at closer.  it was small, which i appreciated (i hate those giant muffins or pieces of bread you can't finish), but it turned out to be the heel of the loaf.  lame!the ambience is cute, didn't look around long enough to really notice.the java mocha caramel chiller is tasty! i went for lunch and ordered a sandwich and it comes with chips and they didn't let me substitute anything for the chips. it probably would have gotten 4 stars if i could have another option besides chips with my sandwich. probably won't go back.very underwhelming. the beverages are always too hot to be consumed, like really really hot. i got a bagel there today, and they did not bother to put the cream cheese on for me. they gave me little cream cheese packets that smelled of a nasty body odor. it took so long for them to prepare my bagel, that i was shocked they did not put on the cream cheese. also the chalk board menu is very difficult to read. go to wormhole or cippolina instead.i'm giving this four stars for the potential i see in it.  it was my own fault for not reading the hours listed and dropping in with a book to get cozy for a while with only 15 minutes left before closing.  i did enjoy my 15 minutes however.  i ordered a latte and was pleased they offered almond milk.  i liked the amount of natural light in the coffee shop, the benefits of being on a corner with all windows.  the tall ceilings also helped.  i would certainly like to try this place again but with more than 15 minutes to take it all in.i stopped in with a fiend on a whim and i had the most amazing smoothie- i think it's called monkey power. i'm already thinking about when i can go back and get another! so delicious!  i can't comment on coffee but i was very impressed by the selection of hot teas available.  i was surprised to read that some people felt the baristas were rude, i had the exact opposite experience- i found the servers to be extra friendly and knowledgeable.  i'll be back for sure!this place was great. it was cold, rainy and miserable outside and we had spent sometime looking for a spot to stop, sit, and have something warm while killing time before heading to the airport. after wandering around the area for the better part of an hour, we stumbled in here.i ordered a coffee, a soy latte and a veggie sandwich to go. i giggled to myself when the guy at the counter told me he'd have my latte "fashioned" for me in just a second. i was sorry later. it literally was fashioned, one of the best coffee drinks i've ever had, complete with the leaf pattern across the foam on top and everything. maybe i'm easily impressed.sure, service was a little slow, but the guy was working alone, and was fairly busy. i was not unhappy with the time i was to wait, nor did i find the service at all unpleasant. the sandwich was still really good when i ate it at the airport a few hours later. for the quality, it's worth a wait.i enjoy the coffee and other specialty drinks here.  i would say it's not a place i would go out of my way to go (especially since i no longer live in the neighborhood) but i'll stop by if i'm in the area.the café is a nice place to sit and hang out with friends or alone.  they don't have as much seating (or nearly as nice seating) as a starbucks or caribou or something, but it's still a place to go.  they also have free wifi, which is really nice if you bring your laptop.  when i went there were a lot of laptoppers, so i presume there's also outlets, as well.  the food is also pretty decent.  i had a sandwich with chips and i was actually surprised that the food was quality.  i really enjoyed it.this morning i paid $5.17 for a large burnt coffee and a muffin that was definitely not made today. this is pretty much the gallery cafe experience in a nutshell. i've gone to this place a couple times in the past couple weeks, since it's on my way to work. here are a few places you could go to get a better cup of coffee:- buzz espresso, goddess & grocer, the intelligentsia place across the street, or any of wicker park's ample coffeehouses-dunkin donuts-the coffee machine in our kitchenthe ambiance is decent, and the employees are friendly, and that's why this place gets two stars. i think my best experience here was meeting somebody from craigslist to buy a cell phone, but that's only because it was a great cell phone.this is our favorite place in the area for delicious breakfast sandwiches and coffee.  i highly recommend ordering your egg sandwich on their foccacia.  it's so fluffy and tomatoey and wonderful.  the sandwiches are named after artists, and there is a great selection of toppings from roasted red peppers to pesto to avocado.  i haven't eaten lunch here, but i only imagine it is also tasty.  sandwiches are about $7.50 each.this place is absolutely amazing they do alll there food by famous artist names the sandwich that i did is a pretzel warhol  it was amazingly good and i will be coming back here again real soonjust plain horrible: bad staff, mean owner, danky paint color, bland coffee, etc.nice atmosphere, cheap, but good food.  have only been here once, but just moved into the neighborhood and can't wait to go back.good coffee, casual environment,  delicious food and smoothies. simple place with friendly staff.i will start with what i don't like: if you order food it is slow, and don't expect happy smiley customer service.everything i have ordered here has been good though. coffee, smoothies, bfast sandwiches, even desserts. i also love that they have almond milk since i can't have soy or dairy.great coffee and i love their breakfast sandwiches.  the only drawback is they seem to be understaffed in the mornings.  only one person works the first couple of hours.  so if you want a breakfast sandwich, be prepared to wait or call in the order.i really enjoyed this place. i ordered a large iced tea and a tuna sandwich since i was dying due to lack of protein.  i don't eat fish but it was my last choice and so i went for it. i noticed that their tuna has no mayo in it which was a plus.  the guys at the counter took a while to notice i was ready to order. lol. so heres what made coming here a great experince...they were playing all the songs from school house rock!!!!! i was totally feelin it!!!! i was in love.  the iced tea was good. very refreshing. the tuna was good. i had no complaints. it had carrots which added a nice texture to it.  overall the food was good and the experience was ok.  the staff needs to pay a bit more attention to the customers though.my friend recently took me here. i love this coffee shop already. very eclectic music selection, friendly baristas, nice atmosphere, big window. the cut out newspaper horoscope made me smile. the coffee was great. we ordered a latte and a mocha latte. both were tasty. will be returning here very soon. :)i just wanted to note that lately the shakes have not been tasting so great; they seem almost watered down or something.  i've heard this from a few other people too.  hopefully its a few isolated incidents. on another note, the people that work here have seemed to get a little friendlier lately as well.i want so badly for this place to be good.  it has a great location and could be such a great replacement for much that has been lost in this neighborhood ... but, it's just not.i won't be as strong about the coffee comments as others, the coffee/food here in my opinion is just okay.what makes this place truly disappointing is the "service"... i'm so disappointed with the level of service here.  *really* slow... they just generally couldn't care less.  god help you if you visit before closing.sadly, you can go just up the street to starbucks - or north on damen to several other more friendly coffee/sandwich shops.i'm very hopeful that one day something will change here.what a waste of real estate.i've been here twice. both times sucked. here, in reverse chronological order, is why i'll never go again:today, figuring a second chance was fair, i walked in and smelled nothing but burned coffee - - you know, that rank smell when coffee has been sitting in a pot, on the burner, for way too long.yuck.the first time i patronized this place the americano was so hot it was undrinkable. i told the lady it was way too hot and asked that she remake it. she brought me an ice cube.my friend and i tried this place earlier this morning and wow were we disappointed! the menu looked great and we were excited to try this place. my food was average at best, but that wasn't even the problem. my friend (who i should note is very low maintenance) ordered an egg sandwich w turkey or chicken sausage. after one bite she noticed the turkey sausage tasted a bit "off". after i tasted it i agreed. she went back to the counter and nicely told the person working there. i thought immediately they would of just apologized and made her a new one. not the case, they basically told her too bad. she then asked if they would just give her a bagel and cream cheese instead. they refused. when we walked out immediately following, a person walking by saw how annoyed we were and said "oh you don't like the food their either?". ironically the person on the street had the same problem with a different breakfast sandwich a few months earlier. it's really too bad bc i wanted to like this place, but food poisoning is no fun and i can't imagine how they could treat their customers the way they treated my really sweet friend. if you want a great breakfast try flo, milk and honey or bongo room. don't chance it here.been a while since i've been here, but i owe them a review.  this place was a go-to for me for a while.  as far as coffee places in chicago goes, it's one of the few good ones.  i could hear underground hip hop on the stereo here, cute, cool baristas, good wifi, and a chill atmosphere.  good spot to try.why so sad? everyone who works there seemed to be on the verge of suicide or just quitting.....what's up with that? had a pre-packaged smoothie mixed with mango juice that was average but nothing i could'nt have made at home. especially for $5.  the music was way too loud for a sunday morning.....the location is really all they have going for them.  i hope someone doesn't open something better in their immediate vicinity because this shop will go under quickly. i guess i just wish that their was something a little more unique about it.....for being called 'gallery'.this place is more than just a coffee shop - they have all sorts of food as well.  i enjoyed a root beer float while sitting in a sunny booth in the front.  as i dined i glanced around and noticed that they have a lot of outlets.  this may sound like a strange observation, but as someone who travels frequently for work and has fruitlessly sought out outlets in many locations, it was nice to see that if i'd had my computer with me i wouldn't be fighting some other patron for power.my favorite thing about this place is easily the music they play in the background - soft opera and other classical music - perfect.this place has exactly what i need.  actually, excellent music most of the time. one of the barristas was playing a ton of minimal electronic music the last time i was there.  damn good refillable drip coffee for a good price ($2) and if you're hungry, a sandwich and chips that is also excellent for the price.  if you want to find a place to do some work on wifi while you drink coffee, and have the option to buy food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg while you're at it, then this is the place in wicker park.walking up to the cafe i was a blank canvas. it seemed a bit minimalist...like a canvas painted black...a new begining. but alas they were open after all as a multi-colored neon announced.the menu board was clearly an excercise in pointalism... so much choice crammed into an elementary school sized portrait of a cafe! breakfast, lunch and dinner provides many a chance for you to render several studies before completing a masterpiece of an opinion.many subjects and shades of coffee are on exposition. they take pride in their craftsmanship and artistry. delectible!their foods are definitely muse inspired, not your mcbreakfast here. these are mural sized and satisfying breakfasts! lunch appears equally illuminating.if you are tired of being starbucked this is a great place to spend like a starving artist and eat like a patron. few galleries can house this many great works. it's worth a try!reasons why i like this place: 1.  it reminds me of a coffee shop/sandwich place that i would find down in athens, ohio where i went to school.  local, small, good food, cozy feel.  i miss athens and all of it's fantastic food choices, so this brings that feeling back for me.2.  right down the street from my bf's house.  so when he is in desperate need for some food because he is extremely hung over, it's easy to run down there and get the food before he ralphs...ha.3.  good sandwiches and lots of choices.reasons why it lost a star...1.  coffee is not that good.  very bitter.  2.  they never put radishes on the one sandwich i get (which in the description it says "radishes") so i have to ask for it on the side!!  i like this place and i will continue to come back!i wish i could write a more in depth review of this place because it seemed to have potential.  i however spent about 15 minutes in this place, all of which were in a line that never moved.  i had sympathy for the one less than rapid guy who was having to do everything, i just didn't have any more time to give to my hopes for an iced tea and a snack.maybe i'll change my mind if i ever muster up enough patience to give gallery cafe another shot.  bummer.addendum a: ok, so i made it back in an it moved up considerably for me.  yummy coffee.  cute employees.  carol's cookies.  yummy breads. i'm glad i gave it another chance for a first impression ;)i'm not a frequenter of coffee-shops - they totally intimidate me and i always feel like i have no idea what i'm ordering or looking for or requesting. i depend upon my friends who i'm actually ordering for to give me as many specifics in preparation for any and all questions a barista might ask me in regards to their order. i always feel like i'm the only person who doesn't know where to properly order and then where to pick-up, and i always feel like the baristas are laughing at me... so basically i'm a wreck in a coffee shop - and this place is quite simply a coffee-shop that also sells food. my chagall was actually really good, but i thought the breakfast sandwiches were slightly overpriced - especially in comparison to the lunch options that came with a side. i ordered at one area, had to pick-up my food at another and had to pick up my friends coffee beverages at yet another - totally across the room. having to shove my way through the lines of customers to pick-up the drinks one-at-a-time, was not fun. i was such a wreck by the time that i left, that i totally missed a step out front and almost dropped/threw/spilled everything i was carrying and quite nearly broke my ankle as well. not worth a pretty delicious sandwich.came here for the first time on saturday (2/2/08).  i desperately needed to get out of the house because i was going stir crazy but really needed a relatively quiet place to study.  gallery cafe was perfect.  music was good, tea was good, service was fine and i got my shit done.  all in all -- a good experience. oh, and easy-to-use free internet.  fantastic.had a good experience with the staff. coffee was great, food was good. but, sandwiches are way overpriced for the portion. total bummer.this is my go to place for breakfast after a night out. with their large menu of breakfast-ish items, i always find something to hit the spot. food items i go for:* breakfast sandwiches (all named after famous artists. all unique and great)* muffins (they have a number of delicious, wrapped up muffins)* coffee (their house blend is very decent). * smoothies (they have a number of flavors and combinations). although i frequent this place, there are a few things that could be improved:* their service is pretty slow. usually there are only two people working the counter. so when they get 4 or 5 orders deep, you can be waiting up to 10 mins for your food. but if you have time, it's worth it. * their staff is cordial but i don't think they've ever been "friendly". as other people have noted, they sometimes seem unhappy to be there. but i've never had anybody be mean or snobby to me. * the tables are a little close together, so it can be awkward trying to talk with a friend when somebody is quietly working on their computer right next to you. but it's a coffee shop, not a library. so, overall, i would recommend it as a way to start a sunday morning.the first time i came to gallery cafe, it was when my roommate and i were freezing our asses off during  an apartment search in wicker park.  looking for some food and hot coffee, we stumbled upon gallery cafe.  thank goodness we did.  we both ordered the rembrandt breakfast sandwich (eggs, avocado spread, tomato, choice of cheese - i like swiss).    it's especially delicious on a toasted croissant.  i try and come in here anytime i can (although i've started duplicating the rembrandt at home).  usually order breakfast, but the lunch sandwiches are good too.  i love how vegetarian-friendly this place is - i never have trouble finding something to order.coffee choices are good and they also have smoothies/blended coffee drinks.  the java chiller is great on a hot day.when i ordered a blt sandwich, it took forever to make. they finally called my name, but i discovered that they had a question about my order. they hadn't even started making it yet! aaaggh!oh, the question was a good one. "do you want lettuce on that?"um, yes. i do.what did they think the "l" stood for in "blt," i wonder?cafes, cafes, cafes...having decided to check out as many independent cafes as possible this year, i realized i pass or drive by the gallery all the damn time so i headed over there this morning for an official look-see.the gimmick is cutesy -- each sandwich is named after an artist -- get it?  the menu des artistes looked comprehensive enough with lots of options for a decent breakfast or lunch as well many choices for vegetarians and even vegans.  counter staff were a bit on the "i'm cool cuz i work at a cafe" side although i actually made one of them smile by getting really psyched about their tea, which is the republic of tea brand and my absolute fave so i was excitedly blithering and bathering about that.  i settled in at one of the booths, which was notably comfy, and contented myself with a spate of people watching and tea sipping.overall, the gallery cafe is comme ci, comme ca.  i would certainly go back but in terms of neighborhood cafes i feel there's a handful of places with a better atmosphere.  c'est la vie.i used to love coming here for a hopper pita pocket at least twice a week (before i moved to lincoln park). although, i dreaded coming here to order a pita pocket. why? the people (or kids) who work here are so damn slow. i listened to a kid have a conversation with another girl who was making coffee for 5 minutes before anyone took my order. and this kid had the nerve to give me a dirty look for standing there waiting to indulge in a delicious pita pocket. hello? i'm paying your salary son so you can live your dream and become a painter. don't get me wrong. the food is really good. make sure you leave your afternoon wide open because you'll need time to wait for your food.perhaps i don't have as delicate a palette as some of the other yelpers, but the coffee at gallery cafe tastes no more or less bitter than coffee does anywhere else.  i wouldn't say it's the best coffee i've ever tasted, but it beats out convenience store swill and just about anything i can make.as far as the help, no one there has been anything but nice to me, and i'm a fairly grumpy, terse customer, so this is no small praise.  plus, if you didn't want a sassy barista, what the fuck did you go to a coffee shop for?i can understand some complaints that the service is slow, but one can stand at the counter and watch them make your meal or drink fresh.  they're not lolly-gagging around; it just takes more than 10 seconds to make a decent sandwich.  time yourself at home and see if you can beat them.  anyway, they've got  plenty of prepackaged, ready to eat food at the counter for those too impatient to wait.anyone who goes someplace besides a library or their bedroom to study and then complains of the noise is, in this yelper's opinion, an r-tard.  the music isn't really my style, but if it bothered me that much, i'd bring headphones.basically, i like this place, but i don't like the asshats that come there just to complain.  do the regular patrons a favor and go to star$$ if you've got a rectal twig.if you like big crowded coffee shops where you are so close you can smell the smoke/booze off your neighbor, this place is not for you.the staff is really friendly, and the environment is very low key. not too many people, but sometimes i think that is the perk.free wifi, good coffee and an overall good coffee shop.good coffee and good sandwiches. a bit overpriced and you have to plan to wait a while on the weekends. i'd probably go to starbucks if it were closer. i know, i'm a bad person. free wifi though. stay away from the carrol's cookies here. freshness is questionable.edit: i am bumping them up one more star because they play pinback a lot.they've got coffee for $1 here!  it definitely beats 7-11 coffee on a cold or tired day.  not the best place for food or atmosphere though..coffee is okay but the food is average and overpriced. this is not a good place to work as there aren't enough tables/outlets and wi-fi is super slow.  tables are a wee bit too close together too. and i agree with laura p.; the baristas need to lighten up a bit.decent little place to get a bite to eat and have a very average cup of coffee. the sandwiches are good and i do like how every wrap sandwich and plate is named after a famous artist. its been around a while and seems to be unaffected by the gentrification that has exploded around its location. i kinda love that.slackerness rules here - its a laid back place to chill out  and grab a bite in wicker park.the good:my super-fattening caramel latte wasn't half bad, and neither was the blueberry scone. aside from that this place is just a big no-no. i showed up a full hour before closing and the girl at the counter didn't want to make me a sandwich. i asked what the hawaiin kona tasted like and on top of not describing it very well "it's very good" she gave me this attitude like i was an idiot for not having had it already or knowing about it. then when i asked for a cup she said she would have to make it. the tables are crowded. the wireless is not working. and every time a song stops she has to go over and pick a new one on her ipod. i don't really like listening to the clicking sound of her scrolling through songs repeatedly.just... don't do it.good location if you live in the area and can walk over.  the service is slow though expect to wait 10 minutes for your sandwich to be made.  specialty drinks (lattes, etc..) are priced about the same as starbucks.don't judge a book by its cover. this humble little place is quite tasty. i had been here a few times for coffee and wifi. recently went here for food to try something different in the neighborhood and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. i ordered the kahlo (breakfast wrap) and it was awesome. i ordered the klimt (lunch wrap) on my trip back the next weekend and it was rockin as well.this place has the worst operations i've ever seen.  there are 3 or 4 people working with 3 or 4 customers and it takes 20 to 25 minutes to get a bagel and cream cheese and a cup of coffeee.  the staff look like they're just hanging out and working when they get bored.   the only reason anyone goes there is because of proximity and conveience.  i would reccommend that you go anywhere else you can.  even if it's a bit further walk, you'll save time overall because they're so slow.  carribou and starbucks are not that far. i get the whole appeal of the non-corporate place to hang out, but that doesn't dictate miserable service.i came here to study, but the lighting was so bad that i could barely see my book. it's also pretty small, which means the seating is shoved together in a cramped space. i don't know why a good coffee shop that doesn't close at 6 and has decent lighting and seating is so hard to find in the bucktown/wicker park area. i've been camping out at starbucks (which has ridiculously loud music) out of necessity, but it would be nice if there was something locally owned.hmmm...i stopped in, got a nice little coffee (iced & black, hard to mess up), got a nice wrap, ate it on the nice little sidewalk patio...  everything i expected. i didn't expect much and i didn't get much...   it doesn't mean they suck!  come on people!...:-)not a sit back and relax type of place... the tables are too close together and the set-up in general is just not inviting.  it seems like a place more ideal to stop in for your morning coffee on the way to work.  i was hoping for a snack but the sandwiches didn't seem like anything i couldn't run home to make for half the price.  there wasn't anything in the bakery display besides some dry looking bagels.  the tea was "okay" (just boxed tea so can't really screw that up).  i did hear 2 customers ask for their coffee to be warmed up again.  strange as i had to wait about 20 mins to steal my first sip of my scalding tea.the iced coffee they brew is divine, not too dark a roast.. the breakfast wraps are great, my girl and i often share them on the drive to work we like the people who work there, too.i'm not a coffee person, so i can't comment much on that, but their smoothies are great!  i had a peach party smoothie with an apple base... it was awesome!also, i had a "botticelli" wrap - chicken, pesto, artichokes, lettuce, red onion, and a tomato wrap... quite delicious as well.  i was impressed with all of their different choices on the menu.  will definitely be going back to try more out.and i don't mind the atmosphere... a little crowded, but at least 99% of the people shower on a regular basis.this morning i walked 1 mile to gallery cafe and it was worth every step.the owner is friendly and helpful. i love this place. i love the simplicity and the folks who work there are so nice every time i go in there. i love the dark coffee and i drink it everyday. it is consistently great. bottom line, fine coffee, caring owners, a top-notch experience at a tiny neighborhood coffee joint.there's few places open early in this neighborhood so it's a good place to grab breakfast. breakfast sandwiches are named for famous painters and are very tasty (hold the salt and pepper though?). free wireless is always a plus.ultimately, i'm just glad there isn't a sandwich named the van gogh...there is nothing more galling than being charged extra for soy milk in your coffee. we don't live in wyoming, this should be a basic service of any coffeeshop in chicago. that isn't the only problem with gallery, but it is the one that pisses me off the most.kind of an unsuspecting place, but gallery cafe does great coffee roasted in-house with a cool, old-fashioned roasting machine. i used to come here for beans until i found big shoulders on milwaukee and chicago, which does even better house roasts. but this place is a good second choice, and surprisingly, they have pretty good sandwiches too.full disclosure: i never tried the food here and i'm not a big coffee drinker.  what's "meh" about gallery to me is that they have the exact same tea selection as panera.  sorry, but you're never going to be my local go-to place that way.good coffee and breakfast sandwiches. (i usually come in the morning so i can't comment on their lunch options.) i live in the area and come here often. i've always found the staff to be pleasant, and coffee drinks are pretty fast. (food takes a bit longer--the prep area looks small so i think they can only do one sandwich or bagel at a time--but it's not overly slow.) the ambiance isn't fancy, but it's a nice place to work, given the free wifi. there are a couple of power outlets around for those with short laptop battery lives.i've been coming here for years. great sandwiches and they roast their own coffee. the owner is nice and she appreciates her customers. my price review is for food and coffee, not just the drinks.burnt coffee! every time.  how come i seem to be the only one commenting on this?  you can smell burnt gallery coffee from blocks away!  most days i can smell it from outside my apartment 4 blocks away -thanks guys! at least just indulge and that new crêpe place opened right next to them so i can get a decent cup of coffee...the breakfast sandwiches my boyfriend and i got were really good and so was the coffee...the only thing i didnt like was that we had to wait a half hour for our food.  it was a saturday morning at 10:15 when we got in and we finally left at 10:45.  i wouldnt consider that a peak time and there werent too many people there, but there were only 2 people working.  we will definitely come back though because it was so good and the place itself is a cool place, but we will only come back when we have plenty of time to wait.it's exactly what you'd expect walking up to the place. an uncomplicated little coffee shop with the standards and a decent tea selection. my lemon bread was a little cloying but at least it was lemony. and i think maybe the burning smell some folks mentioned was caused by the ginormous coffee roasting machine... it is a little rank, i'll admit that. but the service was fine when i came, prompt and cheerful (i had the guy though, not the blond chick).best oatmeal on the planet! great for websurfn and the americano is addictive like crack. sandwich of the month names need work, but otherwise the food is the cat's pajamas. love the staff, skinny blond  guy is the man!i'll say the best part first, the coffee here is the best you'll get in the area.  the beans are roasted and ground in-store, and the difference is obvious.everything else about gallery, however, is just outright irritating.  every person who's taken my order at gallery had an awful attitude and couldn't possibly be more bored to ring me through.  it's made abundantly clear that the other side of the counter is not a priority to these american apparel models in training.  this is a real shame, because they seem like pretty interesting and fun people when they're talking to each other (as you're trying to order).  you pour your coffee for yourself at the tank, which is fine, but it makes the $.50 charge for refill seem a bit steep.  maybe you're paying to avoid a staffer's eyes being rolled at you when you bother them for more coffee.  the tables are small and cramped together, and not very comfortable if you plan on hanging around for a while.  the wifi signal is very weak and drops out fairly regularly, as well.  don't even bother if you need to do any kind of work online.if you're just popping in for a cup to go, you're set (assuming you aren't left waiting at the counter).  if you are looking to enjoy yourself for a while, avoid the attitude and head down to alliance bakery on division.  the coffee doesn't stack up, but the staff and atmosphere are worth it.gallery cafe has a very extensive menu for such a little place.  the breakfast sandwiches are yummy.  the coffee will put hair on your chest, as the overwhelming odor of roasted (burning) coffee beans on occasion clearly indicates.  it's definitely an acquired taste.  the service has never been particularly friendly, but i always get what i ask for and that counts for something.   just be careful when getting take-out, b/c the steaming hot eggs will make the bread/bagel soggy by the time you get home.the gallery cafe is gem.  i have been going there for a couple of years now and i have not been to a starbucks since.  the only negative experience i had was a brief period (about a year ago) where the roaster was working a little too hard, but they got it corrected and it's been great ever since.  great food, great service and fair prices.  it's no wonder the recently opened "brand-name" coffee shop across the street is nearly empty most of the time.can someone (preferably the owners) tell me why it always smells like something is burning? i don't suffer from any health problems but every time i go in, even just to pick up and go, i have trouble breathing that stuff in much less stick around to eat! you folks are always packed because of your free wi-fi but i can't see myself going here to relax, drink coffee and order up a sandwich. as for counter service, you might as well have a robot serving you up. no customer service what-so-ever. try smiling, looking up or being nice once in awhile, it won't kill ya! this goes for everyone. i've been served by almost everyone there and if the owner cared at all, get some personalities in there. in a day and age where service is key, why would you sell yourselves short?i come to gallery pretty much everyday. as i live a block away. there staff is way cool and  very friendly. the coffee is good and so is the food. there is free wi-fi with no limit on time. i tend to do most of my surfing there and hang out with friends. it has a real nice neighborhood vibe, so its welcoming and not snobby. nor is it the starbucks feel of corporate coffee. so as far as wicker park coffee shops this one is the best by far. and i have lived in this hood gor about five years.terrible place. not much more to say other than they have the worst service and this wasn't my first time. waited for more than 15 minutes in line with only one person in front of us and never were greeted or asked what we wanted so we left....there wasn't even anyone in there so not sure what the hold up was. i will never return. also way over priced. much better places to get a cup of coffee (across the street and next door).i love gallery cafe.  it's my friendly neighbourhood caffeine establishment.  everyone is always nice and friendly.  it's sort of the antithesis of starbucks.  i get the impression that the employees really like working there.  in the year i've been going i don't notice any employee turn over. they roast their own coffee in a giant roasting machine so you know it's fresh and delicious.  i've had probably 5 or 6 of the food selections and they've always been fresh and tasty.  my favourite is when rachel makes me a peanut butter and jelly with bananas.  hmmmm. i'm happy to see they've extended the weekend hours.  i hope they keep it that way!they have the best house blend coffee! they roast the beans right there in the cafe. while the service can be slow at times and i am an inpatient person, i gladly wait at this place. it can be hard to get a seat on a weekend morning or early afternoon but on a weekday this place is rather empty. the music they play is very chill and mellow, it doest interfere with your work/reading. they also feature many local artists' work on their walls. i think this place is perfect to grab a bagel and coffee.i get my coffee here every morning.  fabulous!  try the costa rican roast.i don't usually order food when i come here because i live so close to it, but i do enjoy their beverages on special occasions.  service here is pretty unpredictable.  sometimes you will be greeted by a super friendly server, and sometimes, the person behind the bar will act like you are an inconvenience.  so that is one thing i think gallery could do better on.  and on the occasions that i have ordered food, it took forever to get it.  all in all, gallery cafe is a unique place, with both a unique food and drink menu, but can streamline the service.  if they do that, they will be the best coffee shop in town!boyfriend took me here because he loved the manet sandwich. i tried the kandinsky sandwich. it was okay. the person behind the counter was not friendly nor helpful to me. i didn't feel welcomed there.stopped in this morning and pick up a breakfast burritos, outstanding! i'm not a huge fan of the coffee they brew, but the food makes up for the coffee.this place needs to stop buying its own press.  the coffee was on par with what you'd find at a gas station, except with a sheen of frou-frou hipsterism that apparently eminates from the word "gallery" being in the name.  i used to live right by this place, and stopped frequenting it after a few visits as it just wasn't worth it.  i thought it was expensive, and had needlessly long waits.just really 'meh'. their coffee to me sucks. it tastes incredibly bitter. their bagels are like what a jewish new yorker fears they would find in iowa and yeah, the attitude of at least one of the barista's (the sad looking blonde) is a lot to put up with just to eat something on the run.  just really sustenance and that's about it. the guy is nice though and they do have the horoscopes posted daily.while i was eating my sandwich, i thought to myself "julie, you're so lazy, you could have made this yourself at home!"  but on the bright side, it only cost me $4, which is is pretty darn cheap.  i'll probably go back to try the breakfast sandwiches - they all sound fantastic; however, i can't really say i would recommend gallery cafe.  its a convenient neighborhood spot, but it has zero ambiance (you'd think a place called gallery cafe would be artsy and cute... but its not).  i just don't think its that special - particularly in an area like bucktown that has so many great places to sit and eat.have spent several afternoons in the gallery cafe and was just back recently.  the coffee and other drinks are quite good, the atmosphere super laid back and the wi-fi is free.  it actually reminds me of the little places you find in san francisco in the mission neighborhoods and definitely hasn't gotten overly "cool."  frankly i could sit all day here and work and would probably do so more if i lived anywhere near the place. there's even a fedex/kinkos across the street to mail your important documents. :)i would come here to read since the place is so empty. at least it was when i went on a saturday night. my friend and i came in here for hot chocolate cravings. not bad at all although it would help mr barista who served us to smile every once in awhile. it's not that hard; i too was a barista at a few coffee shops.ugh. the music is so loud that i can barely study. also, my coffee had been brewing all day long and was disgustingly bitter. i need fresh coffee!cute concept, good location, decent service, crappy coffee.  i've never eaten the food at gallery cafe but i've had different coffee drinks on separate visits and have always been disappointed.  it's just not good.  and once i went there and they had chik fil-a straws.  how the heck they even got chik fil-a straws is baffling considering there aren't any chik fil-a restaurants in the tri state area.  i'm guessing they stole them and just put them in the straw dispenser?  kinda hard to ignore the tackiness of it all when 'chik fil-a' is clearly printed on the straw wrapper.  anyhow, the place could use a good scrubbing too.  it always looks grimey in there.white chocolate latte is a must! also, the breakfast sandwiches are big and yummy! the staff is as nice as can be too!i love this place! i work right down the street so i look forward to work so i can get my coffee here. $2 for a large iced coffee, and $.50 for a refill....great! they are friendly most everytime i am there. not only do i love their coffee, but the divinci breakfast sandwhich, klimt wrap are sooooo yummy! the muffins are great, if you have some calories to spare indulge in the chocolate chip cheesecake muffin!!!! and i believe they have the best veggie spread too! i can't say enough that i love this place....i wish i lived a little closer so i can go everyday!!!decent sandwiches for lunch, but they do take a long time to make them. also, as another reviewer commented, the roasting coffee beans fill the place with smokiness, and it clings to your clothes and hair for the rest of the day.totally unfriendly, uncool staff.  slow production.  loud music that stinks.  bitchy/ugly staff.  the hours don't make sense (close at 8pm - a coffeeshop?) and the clientelle is pure yuppie.sad to read so many disappointing reviews.  i imagine my optimism stems from a soft spot for neighborhood coffee shops, but i like this place.  their breakfast menu is exactly what i would expect from a cafe like this, and frankly i don't think you can ever go wrong with something eggy and cheesy with a side of caffeine.  just sayin'...how this place even gets 3 stars is beyond me. the coffee is over roasted. the tables are filthy. the wraps and sandwiches are sloppy and bland... and overpriced. 7 bucks and you don't even get a pickle spear or handful or chips? why is this place still here? maybe if you live in the neighborhood you go there for the free wi-fi, but it should not be on anybody's shortlist for a good lunch.i had the wrap that included many veggies and hummus, and it was by far one of the best wraps i've ever had.the vanilla late i had was very strong and not my favorite. the location is prime, but the prices are a little on the high end for a cafe. overall, i will go back only for the food, but i will not go during prime lunch time, since there were no tables open when i went. and, i will get an ice water instead of any drink with caffeine.flush $15 down the toilet and you'll have the same experience. i was shocked at how rude the two girls behind the counter were. they seemed aggravated that we wanted to dine in at 7:20pm on a thursday evening. after realizing that she made the wrong wrap for me, one of them handed it to me anyway and said, "do you want to just eat it anyway? it's pretty much the same thing." i had ordered pesto grilled chicken breast, and she made deli sliced turkey + coppicola. i said no.at 7:50 when i was halfway into my mediocre meal, she yelled "everybody, we're closing in 5 minutes!" and began shutting off the lights.$12 for a wrap and milkshake here? don't waste your money. wicker park has a bounty of other sandwich/coffee shops that don't come with the snobby attitude or poor service.rude service. overpriced. dumpy atmosphere. mediocre tasting coffee. only come here if you really really need a cup of coffee exactly at the moment that you're crossing wood street on your way to someplace more interesting.so i live relatively close now, and an update is due.  while it's still fairly difficult to get a seat, i dig this spot.  the coffee is good, the food is good (better options then most shops), and they recently upgraded many of their tables and chairs.  internet never seems to be an issue here, and the staff has grown on me (for the most part).  they also finally added some curtains so if you are sitting by the windows in the afternoon you aren't constantly blinded.i give them 4.5 stars (subtracting a 1/2 star for the bathrooms which could use a little updating).  bonus for the free espresso shot when you buy one of their bags of coffee.  that should be standard everywhere.roasted: came here because i couldn't drink the coffee at the last place and was really hoping for a better experience. this is a quiet cafe in logan square - kind of reminds me of a 50's diner converted into a coffee shop. they don't offer any sugar free options which is common among the third wave shops. the latte was not good. the espresso was bitter - i struggled to drink the latte and sadly didn't enjoy it. my latte art was sad - i appreciate the attempt but didn't get even a flower. nice to have for here mugs. has to put splenda in my latte but that still didn't make it enjoyable. they used guatemala for their daily espresso which could be partly why i didn't enjoy it. unroasted:  okay let's try this again.   walking in it looks and feels like your pops den.    the staff was friendly but counting down the minutes to get out of here.    love the 50s diner style coffee bar.    the art was decent and appreciate the effort.    coffee was too bitter for me had to add sugar.gaslight - the coffee shop designed for the everyday poet! i'm not kidding, this is probably the only coffee shop in chicago where you feel like you just want to write the book you always wanted to write. that's what their coffee will do to you - it'll make you creative with tons of inspiration flowing in your brain as you slowly drink their delicious coffee.the scenery is also very inviting and the staff are very kind and helpful. if you do come here, i strongly suggest you start with their latte. i've chosen to call it: the cheerful poet! because you always feel like writing something cheerful as you drink it. :)it's good coffee but it's a little bit overpriced. we're in logan square, what can i say, if ya can't beat em, join em. the coffee is just well prepared at gaslight, right down to the soda-water accompaniment.i've had many almond milk lattes and double espressos from here, and the water is the right temperature, and the milk is perfectly frothed (almond milk is notoriously difficult to froth amiright?).just check it out and if you don't like it you don't have to come back. but they care, and so so i.hands down one of my favorite coffee shops, ever. the baristas know their stuff, make a good cup of coffee, and are so nice. the decor is super cool too. it's a good place to get work done, read a book, or just people watch. they have a limited food menu, but it's all good! i recommend anything on it. if you're in the area, stop in, get an americano, and enjoy what this shop has to offer.this is the best coffee shop in logan square, hands down. great coffee, the staff is genuine and wonderful, and the kitchen is a hidden gem of delicious offerings. anyone who shits on gaslight is either pretentious or just self consciously projecting their woes into the place. it's the best.over the years they have fine tuned a lot.  at some points their food is downright gourmet.   sadly, they got rid of their pour-over which is one of the reasons i went there.  also, i did have a rude an unfortunate situation with one of the owners.  overall the place is still good, but i can't say that the people behind it are that great.came here to get some work done after an online article recommended it. cheap coffee, definitely hipster, and good for work if you don't need wifi. wifi is horrible.what i like about it:- quiet atmosphere but not so quiet that if you are talking with a group of friends, you will be uncomfortable. just be sure you're not talking super loudly and disturbing people.- natural light (sometimes can get too bright)- ok coffee (nothing to write home about, but not bad at all)what i dislike about it:- the pastries look good, but are not actually very good. the croissant we got was not flaky but rather kind of hard and brittle. it looked like it was a little old.i tend to hold cafe's to a higher standard, i'm from brooklyn (of the new york variety) and i would be arrogant enough, yet justified in saying, we have the best coffee shops in the world. i believe the success of a cafe can be attributed to a few rudimentary but greatly overlooked qualities - it's just coffee, not magic. i meannn what is the hiring process at this coffee shop? there must be stipulations in order to be employed as a hipster barista here, you must 1. be apathetic to anything and everything, 2. be so soft spoken and quiet that people could only hear you by summoning demons from the necronomicon and ask them wtf you just said, 3. detest any and every male that walks into the café who isn't, anton lavey, h.p. lovecraft, or barbra streisand, and 4. practice witchcraft daily. what is it that we all love about coffee shops? it's really simple actually, strong but delicious coffee, good music, a warm and welcoming atmosphere with interesting and/or attractive people. the "coffee" could vaguely be called as such because it tasted more like someone who just drank real coffee peed into a cup, which mind you was only equally as warm but not nearly as flavorful. and although the awkward mortuary like atmosphere in this shop encourages absolute funeral-like-silence and stillness, you are made to stand up, walk over to the counter (with the judgmental barista overlooking their work like rasputin above the gulag) pick up the urine-like-substance, and as if you are a monkey on a circus tightrope, carefully walk back to your micro sized table meticulously carrying an overly full cup of said pee-coffee, clanking and spilling all the way back. all this whilst, of course, everyone stares at you in disgust and disdain, a problem perhaps easily solved if the music wasn't going on and off as if the witch baristas were in a collective seance communicating with dead customers who had previously drank their pee-coffee, but instead only managed to channel terrible mgmt songs through a sound system that someone donated to goodwill in 1997. i have certainly been gaslighted, i left questioning my own sanity, like macbeth being called by the coven of witches, as well as feeling like i was severely molested (and ironically i happen to be catholic).coffee shops in logan square are a dime a dozen, much like bars around here. however, because of it's easy to find location, gaslight stands out which gave me enough of a reason to stop by and take a load off. very great tasting coffee here, at an affordable price. a lot of seating too, although it's always fairly crowded here, so good luck finding a seat! this is not the best cafe to do any work, as it can get a little loud up in here.this place has very great service!it's at a very convenient location and the tea is awesome.sophisticated, unique and expensive beans in simple prep (meaning no crazy syrups and lattes).  plenty of seating that is easily filled with few turn around.  humans warming the light grey steel seats with their laptops. (tot) some park their bikes inside.  got lock?service is quick, attentive and fool proof.  clean and organized venue.note:  rust inside washable tin water cup is a design style.  my heart skipped a beat.  it's fully glazed/sealed and you don't feel the bottom rust at all.  a life (water) and death (rust) concept in a cup?wow! what a lovey coffee joint in the middle of logan square. i saw this place from the blue line as i as riding from the airport during a delay and had to stop in for a coffee. the store is located on a great corner street with huge front windows overlooking a great street view. not only that, the interior is chic and modern with a hipster twist. their menu is professional and thorough and their baristas are skilled. i enjoyed a great pour over while i relaxed and passed some time. stop in and enjoy this place!awesome decor, awesome seating, awesome latte. i really loved hanging at this coffee shop, but i will say my overall impression was on their quality roast. i loved how smooth their coffee/latte's were! i was super impressed with the whole experience and the neighborhood. also, found free parking! score. the music was a little loud as others have stated.cool coffee shop, interesting loft design, good looking latte.friendly staff, cute pastry (though i didn't have any but they look delicious!) good ambient music. great place to escape home to read a book.thank you for supporting 2athe ambience here is very modern and pretty. it's a really nice place to sit and enjoy yourself...if you can find a seat. can be pretty hard to find a seat on the weekend. the baristas are always friendly, and the coffee is good. but i think my favorite aspect is the food menu. it's very unique, not what you normally see at coffee shops. i think the menu may change sometimes, but one time i was there we actually had a small charcuterie plate. pretty cool for a coffee shop!excellent coffee and environment, great taste and flavor.  one of our favorite stops when going back to chicago.  no wonder the chicago tribune featured them in today's newspaper.  one of chicago's finest, check it out!great beans, fast service, and a beautiful spot with lots of natural light and seating space! we picked up some beans to bring home with us - love the packaging with the wax seal!i'm a bit of a coffee shop snob after having explored so many in brooklyn while i was studying for my mcat, and since moving back to chicago, i've been searching for my favorite spots. well let me tell you, this happens to be one of them. not only does gaslight roast their own coffee in house, but their small food menu and selection of pastries is quite enticing.i've gotten lattes, drip coffee, iced coffee, and iced tea here, and i haven't been disappointed. the only disappointment is the price, but that's pretty common for a small local shop. they do have free wifi with outlets and it's a great spot to get some work done if you can snag one of the tables near the outlets ;) i also ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup the other day, and the tomato soup has a really pleasant spice to it and the grilled cheese came on a really delicious parmesan-encrusted bread with perfectly melty cheese on the inside. it's definitely pricey at $14 for a grilled cheese and tomato soup, but the portion is large, the depth of the soup bowl makes for easy dipping, and it was more gourmet than your standard can of campbell's with white bread/american cheese grilled cheese.the service has always been good - fast and friendly. and you can tell this is definitely a neighborhood spot, with lots of regulars, and lots of employees high-fiving each other and the patrons that come in! great experience overall.you can see pictures/stories on my instagram @afoodiegoescleanishwow!!! let the discerning rejoice. this chicago highlight has all the 3rd wave coffee goodness you crave with a total neighborhood feel. this is the perfect marriage of roasters and baristas who know what they are doing. though i will say more, if you are trying to pick your one stop for coffee in chi-town look no further.let's start with the ambience. right when you walk in you feel like you are right where you want to be. cozy wood colors, lower light (but not dim), appropriate levels of music and the steady singing of steam wands and high end grinders. with about 6 or 7 individual tables, two bar areas and a shared community picnic style table, there is plenty of seating. and get this - free wifi and power outlets. all the snobby goodness of the coffee with no one glaring at you for posting up for a work day (but do the right thing and keep buying coffee the longer you sit).the baristas were kind, engaging and helpful. their recommendations were spot on (my colombian chimex was spot on!!!). the place was super clean, had two spotless bathrooms and a steady (but never overbearing) stream of customers. they offer a drip coffee, but if you have the time spring for the chimex. the espresso drinks are also killer and expertly executes. tea? hot chocolate? yes! they can accommodate you. get here.good coffee shop studying location, lots of seating areas consisting of long communal bench, numerous small tables to share w/ one other person, and counter seats. lots of outlets around the area to charge your laptop. wifi is a tad slow. the place is a bit dimly lit but it has lots of natural lighting coming in. thus, once the sun disappears, it can be a tad bit dark to study in, which may or may not work in your preference. noise level is average.coffee is good and decently priced. workers are helpful and attentive. very hipster place. love their decors. ample street parking that are metered/free.i love the outdoors, and this shop does a great job to invigorate that outdoors, cozy like them. i had their drip coffee and my girlfriend had their hot chocolate (she's not a coffee drinker lol), and atmosphere is amazing. always a pleasure being here.by far the best coffee shop i've ever been to. the baristas are not your stereotypical mean coffee hipster snobs - they are so nice. i love this place...tried this place while visiting chicago. it's a great coffee shop, as others have described, very spacious which makes it a nice coffee shop for studying. it has a variety of table arrangements which are even suitable for larger groups. my latte was perfect, didn't need any sugar or anything added to it which is always a good sign. kitchen closes ealry (at around 3pm) so if you want food, be sure to order it early!the coffee at gaslight is really good--cappuccinos are made well and the milk is high quality. they roast their own beans, too! further, i really liked the cheese scone--it was fresh and reasonably priced.the downside here is the music--while we were here, the baristas were playing some really loud, really obnoxious music (think experimental chainsaw quartet). even through my large, over-the-ear headphones it was grating. maybe they were in a weird mood? in any case, to those hoping to get some work done: beware the cafe dj.awesome space with a lot of natural light and seating. service was really friendly. i enjoyed my latte and i'll be back to try more of their options since their coffee is high-quality.my only complaint is the music. i was there for a few hours and the whole time it was some strange french/italian rock playlist? idk, but it was somewhat obnoxious to have on at a coffee shop. it was too loud for headphones to block it out.well, my latte was tasty so nothing to complain about there. the staff seemed pleasant and friendly. the place itself is very quiet so good if you're trying to study or get work done; a bit awkward if you want to talk with friends. not sure that this would be my first coffee shop option but it got the job done.my girlfriend and i were staying nearby and came in on a rainy saturday morning.it has a nice corner location with lots of natural light. the inside is pretty spacious with a few tables. it is a good local coffee shop to socialize, work, or people-watch. it's quiet but not awkwardly silent and not boring. hipster would be a very accurate way to describe the place, but not in any kind of negative context.i got a cappuccino, my girlfriend a hot chocolate, and we split a ham & cheese croissant. both of our drinks were delicious and the croissant was better than expected too. it is easy to tell that gaslight offers quality coffee products and even food. i did notice some other food items that i would certainly like to try next time i'm in.it is a little pricey for what it is, although not much out of reach compared to something like starbucks.great local spot in logan square!i think after many visits that is is my favorite in chicago. it's cozy, great espresso, great food... you really can't go wrong! the staff is always really friendly and even though it's usually busy when i go there, i can always find a spot to park while i enjoy. highly recommend.in my top three favorite coffee shops in the city! the coffee is top notch. delicious and consistent. staff is super friendly. the space is beautiful and awesome for doing work throughout the day. understandably, it gets very busy on the weekends.this place is spacious.street parking. pay to park or there's a free parking on fullerton. got the vanilla latte. delicious. not too pricey. not loud. there's a lot of outlets. a lot of tables to sit. no outlet around the high seats though. workers are nice. very welcoming with their greeting!friendly vibe. terrible coffee. i ordered a croissant and a macchiato, cost 8$ and five minutes of time. croissant was rock hard and had no taste. espresso was by far most disappointing. the barista seemed as if they knew what they were doing. my mistake was trusting their judgement.  the espresso was acidic and sour. wouldn't waste my time again.disappointed that they don't serve pour overs anymore.  the drip coffee was pretty good and i enjoyed the breakfast sandwich.my favorite neighborhood cafe - lot's of seating, great light, excellent coffee, and friendly staff.  good place to get work done if you can get a table.coffee: roasted in-house, the beans are nicely packaged in plain brown paper bags with different colored wax seals.  their cold-brew is excellent, as is their espresso and drip coffee.  their espresso actually comes with a little cup of sparkling water which is a nice, refreshing afternoon option.  watch out if you order hot coffee in a for-here cup, though, as their cups do tend to cool the coffee down pretty fast (or maybe i'm just a slow drinker).  so, if you don't wanna gulp of lukewarm coffee, drink up!ambiance: the cafe is really bright and spacious, with plenty of tables (though they fill up fast).  it has kind of a woodsy, eclectic look to it - with taxidermy and antiques and interesting wallpaper.  the music can be a little hit or miss - sometimes it's a bit loud and grating.  one thing to note, if you sit by one of the window seats in the middle of the day when the sun is shining through you might end up sweating as i think it's a single pane - this even happened to me in the winter, the sun can get really hot in there. food: i've never tried their pastries (there usually weren't a lot of options) but they have a really nice menu that they serve out of their kitchen.  it can be a little on the pricey side, but it puts other coffee shop food to shame, particularly the avocado toast and the grilled cheese. staff: super friendly - i was in here at least 3-4 times a week for over a year and never had any issues.  overall, a great spot in a really nice part of the neighborhood.coffee shops in a city as large as chicago and in a neighborhood as trendy as logan square are common. so is the coffee. this place was common and cold.i have never had a cup of coffee so fantastic it   made me want to be a loyal patron of an establishment... and i still haven't. it is normally the ambiance and/or the customer service that brings me back and all i can say is i will not be going back to this place. the only thing i feel this place had going for it was the decor (rustic). the customer service was absent. maybe it takes sundays off.you'll get the same cup of coffee and hipster feel from another bourgeois shop in the neighborhood.lovely. bright and sunny. music was at the right volume. drinks served in glasses instead of plastic  unless you specify.great coffee shop.cool atmosphere. prompt, attentive service. high quality product.nothing too exciting going on here but it's a great coffee shop in the area. it's a great place to hide away and study. it's also low-key compared to all the coffee shops that have too many tourists inside. i'd say this is a neighborhood gem at most. go ahead and grab your coffee and bounce!talk about hipster. coming from spending a lot of time in williamsburg, brooklyn, i easily made myself at home. this place had been recommended to me by a friend who lives in the area. i could see now why. there's a ton of seating, cool rustic atmosphere, and a pretty extensive menu with drinks and food. i just got a drip coffee, but i could really taste the crisp flavor of the coffee beans.i was surprised for a saturday afternoon that there were a ton of people working and eating a late brunch. for the amount of tables there were, i was only able to find a seat at their bar off to the side of the espresso machine. their wifi is good, which is always a big plus in my book. i'm glad i was recommended this place. the next time i'm in the area in need of coffee, i know exactly where to go.i'm beyond ashamed to write a yelp review about avocado toast - but jesus titty-fucking christ you guys, it's so damn good. go there, get that.apparently i still have to write words to make this qualify as a review, so the coffee is good too. also fuck mike pence.fantastic. there's a coffee shop popping up in a new city everyday so what can one do to differentiate? be this place. from the subway seating, in the corner, to the great choice of music -- oh and the coffee is actually good! the service was quick and the clientele was dope. i always check out what the audience is for a coffee shop to see if it's a true neighborhood hang. this one fit well. plenty of people just coming in for a quick cup, stopping to study, or having a work meeting. i was coming off of a long travel day and this place was the perfect place to decompress with a hot americano. highly recommend!the quality of the coffee at gaslight is nothing to quibble about.  however when it comes down to it, even with the prime location and open windows, it wouldn't be a coffee shop i would come to and try to get some work done.  this is because the chairs, though aesthetically pleasing are generally uncomfortable and you won't want to stay there for longer than an hour.  still if this isn't something that would bother you, rest assured that between their friendly service and quality coffee, you'd definitely enjoy your brew.i've only tried their teas, and they're ok. i mostly come here to spend hours studying or getting some sort of work done. it's a quiet atmosphere, but it can get kind of packed certain times of the day.definitely one of my favorite coffee shops to grab a cup on my way to work. they're always pretty speedy.stumbled here instead of walking to intelligentsia and fell in love. calm welcome, great area to get some work done. no problem with the internet (pw: tacotuesdays) and nice hipster decorations and magazines around if you need a little break. coffee and croissants are really tasty; they can warm up the pastries if you ask. coffee grinder in the back, feels pretty old school yet modern. i love it! (i'd live here tbh)i'm torn on the rating ... the coffee and canele here is definitely a 4 star quality but the service was unfortunate.  the barista had an edge of contempt in her voice and really had no interest in serving anyone that morning.honestly ... the coffee was very good compared to bowtruss and far better than intelligentsia up the street.  it was flavorful with a natural note of cocoa and the acidity was low so you didn't that the bitter note most people complain about dark roast.  the canele had the perfect crust with a nice eggy custard middle.  i would be so happy with this choice if it wasn't for the eye rolls by the barista.if she was just neutral in her expression... easily a 4 star experience.if you know me you know that brothers k iced coffee is my nirvana. i was surprised to find another place with outstanding iced coffee...it was so good at the gaslight!excellent quality coffee beans from around the world expertly roasted to release their up most aroma and flavor. every bag of coffee purchased comes with a complementary shot of perfectly pulled espresso. a great addition to the city of chicago. the atmosphere is relaxing and friendly to those looking to open up their laptop to work while enjoying their favorite esspresso drink.pretty cool spacious place. there sign from the outside looks very similar to starbucks, weird!!!! i tried the congo pour over using chemex( suggested by the barista)and it was below average. disappointing. the cinnamon morning roll was decent. overall:atmosphere: 9service: 8coffee: 4meh! nothing special.... not worth it.this is a nice little coffee roasters and brewers in logan square. the furnishings are spare. and, the space is a little tight for the number of customers they serve. but, i can say i am a fan of their coffee. i snapped and posted a few pictures of the designs they put in the froth on their lattes and chais. they were very nicely done.i like this place, if i'm up for some noise and some young logan square vibe.  this coffee shop isn't quiet at all if you're one of the serious working bees attempting to get some study or work done.  i personally think it's cute hang-out, get-together kind of place since they have various sizes of tables for solo travelers, as well as for a group of five (5).  the coffee is good and prices are alright for the logan square standard ($7.65 after tax for a croissant and a medium cappuccino).  this place has a plenty of natural lighting and ample opportunities for chilling and people-watching.  rosa j. is a professional people-watcher.  unfortunately, she doesn't get paid for doing this.  the location is at the corner of milwaukee and fullerton.  you see the blue line trains coming through.  the cta california blue line station is on the south of gaslight, on california ave....... great place. looking for a place to study, get work done or just get away with a good book?? come here. also super cute barista making your coffee is always a positive. good vibes. good coffee. what more can we ask for?great coffee and croissant. easy parking on street. great location to pop by between appointments!...am not a coffee fan, but this coffee was very good.  more importantly, the croissant was ahhhhhmmmmmaaaaaziing and the morning roll equally so. great space to hangout. read.  get stuff done.this place is definitely a specialty shop with coffee roasting experts at the top of their trade.   a great place to go learn about the process,  the servers are friendly and love to discuss their passion for coffee. the coffee should be tried black first and tasted as it is.  the flavor is amazing and intense.  then add milk and sugar as you find suitable.   just try it.  you'll be surprised.  lots of space to sit and work if that is what you are into.   the number of outlets lacks away from the tables near walls but generally if you can last long enough someone will leave and you can get a spot if there isnt already one.one of/perhaps the best espresso i've ever had. their  ethiopia coffee is some of the greatest coffee in the world. if you are serious about coffee and particularly bright flavors you will be very happy. there is no place in chicago that competes, gaslight is the real deal. go for espresso, cortado, pour over etc. the espresso is what will explode in your mouth so i would start with that. wonderful acidity you don't find in many other run of the mill independent roasters who generally fear it. you need to see what you are missing. this is a special thing for me when i'm in chicago so i'll usually start with espresso then end with a pour over or cortado or both.i often ship the coffee to my home in la. once a shipment went missing and gaslight replaced it.weak, watery chai for $4+ in the smallest size. prefer chiya chai or sbux.latte was good. food was poor. omelette was  runny and very salty. salad was three pieces of lettuce.dangerously good coffee... and my fancy friends agree! while, i'm not a coffee aficionado, i do have lots of experience drinking coffee and have plenty of bougie friends and coffee purists who would consider themselves experts. gaslight is at the top of our lists. the last pour over i had was their ethiopia and i am salivating just thinking about it. it's the perfect start to your morning, afternoon, and evening - whenever you need a warm and comforting beverage (with a kick of caffeine). gaslight's atmosphere is really nice and comfortable. don't let all the trendy people and hipster decor intimidate you. the set up is nice. you can sit at the bar, a community table, or a more private table. personally, i love watching the baristas in action. everyone is really friendly and the it's a really relaxing place to hang out, get some work done, or just chat with a friend!"gaslight coffee" -- sounds cool, right? with a name like that, gaslight better be cool beyond its namesake. and it is.taxidermy on the walls, a mesmerizing wall paper near the condiments, a wooden community table, bar sitting, a handful of 2-4 seaters, and the dark, solemn wooden floor that is impossible not to appreciate.then, the coffee compliments the feeling of gaslight. it's smooth and has no sharp, jarring taste. gaslight operates in harmony and is a pleasant, cabin-quaint coffee shop that distinctly stands out in chicago.where does an espresso $3 cost more than an americano $2.75? @gaslight. is it possible to order an americano and hold the water? "i dont know ask the owner" says the hipster barista.i settled for an iced americano that cost more than a regular americano... the price was 75c more.. how? oh because theres a double extraction of espresso = 4 shots instead of the regular 2 to avoid watery coffee, how about you guys make it optional 2 shots or 4 instead of assuming someone will want 4 and take off for the moon.. i think prices should be laid out easier instead of their 5-6 coffee menu items.amazing coffee and food, hands down. love this place, because not only is their coffee fantastically delicious, they also serve real food alongside their array of baked goods! many coffee places will carry sweets ranging from chocolate croissants to cookies, but gaslight has actual food for you to properly start your day with something nutritional. this is a complete plus for me. my boyfriend and i visited gaslight for the first time and were delighted to find seating on a busy sunday morning. we ordered the colombian coffee pour over, latte with almond milk, breakfast bowl, and the gaslight breakfast. starting with the drinks, the colombian pour over was intensely flavorful and robust. the latte with almond milk was creamy, smooth, rich, and absolutely delicious. the almond milk added a slight sweetness to the overall coffee. now onto the food! the breakfast bowl was savory and delicious! the little ham pieces of bacon bits really added a bite to the rice, the fried egg on top really pulled this dish together! the gaslight breakfast was incredibly delicious as well! the fried duck egg laid on top of a savory slice of ham, flavorful sun dried tomatoes, a smear of some nutty and green spread, and a hardy slice of toasty bread. this coffee and food combo was perfection.i cannot rave about this place enough! i will for sure be back!coffee is excellent. seating may be limited since this is popular spot so i prefer to breeze in and out and take my drink on a walk through logan square.your run-of-the-mill hipster coffee shop in logan square.  that being said, i think they've made really good use of the unique shape of the building.  a decent study spot, seating was fairly ample when we arrived.  the food and coffee was a bit on the pricey side, but i was pleased that my iced coffee was a decent size for what i payed, and the grilled cheese was undeniably delicious.i thoroughly enjoy coffee, so i was excited to try this place. first of all, the drip coffee is good and strong. there is a sharp taste when you drink it black (like i do), but i'm sure with a little cream or milk that would mellow out a bit. the ambiance is chill, and the space is wide and open. it's great for working or reading, which many people were doing.the reason why this is getting 3 stars is solely due to service. it almost seems like the people at the register and serving coffee don't want to be there, and it shows in their service.i don't even understand how you can run a coffee shop and only have one size of iced coffee!! what is this?! communist russia?? jeeblets, when i ask for a large iced coffee, i don't expect to get a 12oz coffee, i expect to get a large mother effing coffee. bow truss, i'm looking at you too. this is completely preposterous. maybe it's on me though for coming back many times hoping for a different result.additionally, i don't now if my plebeian taste buds are too unsophisticated to enjoy this bitter-af coffee, or if everyone else is just lying and pretending it's really good. every new coffee shop that pops up reminds me how freaking good cafe mustache is. even though *snooty voice* they don't roast their beans onsite.the three stars mainly go for the interior design and the super friendly staff. and because i feel like a d-bag giving a local place that has really done nothing to me less than 3 stars. ya know what though? they have done something to me. they gave me a 12oz cup when i asked for a large mother effing coffee.this place is alright. won't ever become a fave coffee shop of mine because it just doesn't have the totally "homey, kick back and enjoy a cup of caffeine as you catch up with a friend" feel. i'd say it has more of a productive vibe to it. like if you're looking to catch up on some work or have a meeting on an upcoming project, then this is the place for you. but if you want to enjoy another's company, this wouldn't be my first or even third pick. i would say 5 stars for drinks though, and that's really all that matters, right? lost a star for the lack of a double door. the windy city wind made the gaslight pretty cold for the consistent traffic coming in and out with no double door entrance to help yield the chill. otherwise, pretty decent coffee shop!gaslight coffee roasters definitely didn't light a fire under my desire, and in fact it dissuaded me from all the hope i had for this place.  i walked into gaslight coffee roasters thinking that maybe i'd hit the jackpot for coffee and atmosphere, but i was wrong.  this café is clearly a beloved café for many, but it definitely didn't suit me and my needs.  i came here for a business meeting and although there appeared to be several people busily doing their work, i couldn't concentrate, or even hear my thoughts, because the music was so incredibly loud.  it seemed to me that the music got louder while i was there; i know coffee shops can't cater to everybody, but knowing that coffee shops do attract business people during the day it would be better if the music "fit the bill", so to speak.besides the music, which was painfully dreadful in addition to being loud, the atmosphere felt very strange to me.  there were bags of coffee grounds just laid on the ground, and although this was assumedly for some artistic appeal it really just got in my way and looked out of place.  a lot of the decorations in this café looked odd and out of place which is probably why it felt a tad bit uncomfortable being in here.  clearly, i was not a happy camper with the atmosphere and that's also in part to the lack of table space in here.  there's plenty of small tables, but they were all taken up - and this was in the middle of the day on a weekday.  i had nowhere to sit except for at the bar where the baristas were exchanging inappropriate jokes in front of patrons, like myself.  onto the coffee - well, it was okay.  i got the drip coffee which had a hint of back cherry and vanilla in it;  the coffee was a little bit bitter, but a lot of cream and sugar helped that.  the coffee definitely was not terrible, but i can say that i would not get it again...even if i could add all the cream and sugar in the world.  i'd probably have gotten something else to drink, but there was barely anything to choose from.  they offered the essential drinks, but nothing that really tickled my fancy - i want my fancy drinks and i want them now.  no, i can go for good solid coffee, but i was underwhelmed by this coffee.  i was underwhelmed by their snack selection too...i bet that some of the "legitimate" food is quite good, but i wasn't able to indulge in it.  for the price this was also disappointing...i don't mind paying for good, jolting coffee, but if i'm going to pay a pretty penny for a mediocre drink i'll just go to starbucks.great coffee shop. as a regular at a few intelligentsia's in the city i enjoyed this place a lot. i stopped in gaslight one morning when i was in the neighborhood running some errands. i stopped in and got a latte and stayed while to read my book. i went on a saturday around 11am and the store was a bit crowded but i was able to find a place without a problem.the baristas were friendly and my latte tasted fine. the decor and ambiance was pretty cool. it was kind of a rustic, woody feel to the place. while i was there reading my book for about an hour the other patrons were either chatting with friends, working on laptops alone, or reading like me. definitely a chill place to get some good coffee/espresso and relax.would definitely recommend, i did not give gaslight 5 stars simply because it was not the best espresso i ever had and when reviewing a coffee shop if it's not the best i don't think it warrants a 5. great place though!great place in logan square. was slightly confused when they didn't have a sign on their door (and instead graffiti) but it's totally welcoming and bright once you walk in.the interior was one of the best things about this place. it's huge and open with plenty of seating to enjoy your drink. there is a big bright window overlooking milwaukee avenue. the interior has a rustic feel but is still very put together and doesn't seem to be trying too hard. very comfortable to sit and talk for awhile.i got a skim chai latte (amazing) and my husband got their basic drip coffee. he's a huge coffee snob and he said it was great. will definitely be back here...great place to study, relax, talk, or just get caffeinated!came here around 11:30am on a weekday - it was crowded but tables opened up within a few minutes. wifi is strong and outlets are abundant.i bought a cappuccino and some food. the coffee was excellent. the food was called "not bagel and lox" - it was smoked salmon and dill cream cheese on a hearty piece of toast. a little expensive ($10.50) for what it was. it also took 25 minutes which seemed a bit excessive. other than that though, food and coffee were great. one star taken off for price and time taken, but i definitely recommend this place.cool "little" corner coffee shop in the bucktown area.everything inside is wooden, and you definitely get that hipster-y vibe. the coffee is good, the staff is nice, the ambiance is great for hanging out to take a break. lots of seating around the perimeter, but they could probably use a bit more along the left side ... anyway, a solid coffee shop.coffee was spot on, smooth and not rough or acidic. great place for one on one meetings.one of the best coffee shops i've been to in chicago! coffee was unreal and the avocado toast i ordered off today's daily menu was unbelievable.  i was pleasantly surprised to find that caliber of quality and creative food served at a coffee shop. overall, great space to meet friends, get work done at, or simply indulge in items on their menu!great coffee & fresh breakfast ingredients. it's a little hipsterish, but nice if you like a read or tapping on the keyboard with your coffee.i've been to my fair share of coffee shops, and gaslight coffee is high on the list for quality espresso bars that just make you feel 'that' way.the coffee is good, real good. also, they offer a handful of breakfast/brunch options to pair with your coffee. it's nice to have a coffee bar that offers qualitative coffee and food options that can be adjusted for people of multiple different dietary needs.all-in-all, gaslight coffee is worth your patronage!overview: typically in my reviews, i give a star for each of these categories (service, food, drink, ambiance, parking) and then add up to rate my experience at a particular business. service - excellent! food - decent options. didn't try any so couldn't comment on the taste. a lot of people were ordering the scones and croissant so must be good. drink selection - excellent! cortado was nice and smooth. ambiance/cleanliness - hipster for sure! it's logan square, what else would you expect? but this place is not snobby. very chill and hip at the same time. parking - street parking! not a fan! had to circle around the block twice to find a spotfew cafes distinguish themselves by how they gather the afternoon light, but beautiful gaslight does.  long, large windows lap in the late afternoon light like nowhere else in the city.  sit here in the golden hour, as the sun's rays cut through the evaporation vapor above a drink.  the decor is part surrealistic british drawing room, part coffee warehouse, part design den, part theater, and a dash of cabin.  here's what i mean: densely filigreed wallpaper on the back wall is adorned with a faux gold-leafed taxidermied stag, a goose hangs above the coffee bar - two cargo pallets in the back corner are piled upon with large sacks of coffee beans - a brick side-wall carries blueprints for the sewage system of a local high school - a bank of theater seats sit backed up against a line of windows as you enter - sprinkled about are a coleman cooler, gas lamps, vintage thermoses  and pine cones.  it's a fantastic place.  there is a lot of hipster hate out there and if that's a problem for you, you've been trigger warned.  to me this is bohemian beauty at its best - i do not know how to feel bad here, and always love when i can drop in.great! espresso porta filters need some cleaning- espresso tasted a bit bitter/burnt, but great vibe, service, & food.gaslight sits in the middle of logan square among a slew of other nearby coffee places. you have all your typical coffee shop characteristics here: hipster individuals, good coffee, and free wifi. what makes this place stand out is that they offer food that you can order and they'll bring it to your seat. while i didn't get to make use of such a service, i saw others doing so and it seems like a genius idea for anyone hoping to stay there for extended periods of time so that you don't have to leave to grab a bite. the interior provides wonderful large windows that bring in beautiful light. however this makes it pretty hot if you're sitting anywhere near the windows. either they need to install some blinds or crank up the ac because when the place is crowded and the only place to sit is near the windows, and people literally sweat in those spots. staff here is friendly but they lacked a sense of professionalism. there was a lot of hanging out in the back. also during my stay here, they consistently fiddled with the volume of the music playing. i don't mind music playing at coffee shops, it's the norm, yet at this place they really turned up the volume to the point that i could hear it through my over-ear headphones. people like music, i understand that, but one's own personal taste of music shouldn't be so loud that others are forced to hear it even with attempts to drown it out haha.that's right! two amazing coffee shops in the same damn day!joe has done it again, this time, completely by accident. we were headed to wormhole, but got sidetracked by simply seeing this place and all it's hipster magnificence.i had my first pourover and it was splendid. the interior design is outstanding, and was apparently executed by the owners. it seems professionally designed and decorated, so i may have to speak to the owners personally about it and grill them.my coffee was great. did i mention that already?joe got the mocha--described as "possessing good chocolate that wasn't too bitter."aj got the chai--"it was good."please check this place out in my photos and note that it (apparently) gets crazy-busy on the weekend. like a bar or club, but with caffeinated hipsters.the atmosphere and mood were delightful during this thursday afternoon, however.this place gets five stars, as it provides the exact thing you'd think it would--wax-sealed coffee bags and all ;)great ambiance for a coffee house. decent coffee. they are trying to get that artisanal taste, but they fall a little short. very crowded place.  most of the seats were occupied by what appeared to be students doing homeworki came in this past sunday and sadly my opinion of gaslight hasn't changed. for someone who can live in a coffee shop for an entire day, i think the environment is just alright - it's a little bit more "sterile" than wormhole or ipsento, but has plenty of seating, great lighting, and is a good place to hang out. you can choose from a table or grab a seat at the bar and watch the baristas do their magic.the coffee/espresso is a bit lacking. i ordered a latte, and the espresso tasted extremely bitter; i barely enjoyed the latte even after i added a shit ton of sugar to it (cause we all know sugar makes everything taste better). my friend felt the same way about her coffee. there just really isn't much to say about this place - average atmosphere, average drinks, no specialty drinks, and sadly, my latte art wasn't even that good as those that are shown on yelp. i guess the bathrooms were clean?i enjoy this coffee shop. if it were in my neighborhood it would most likely be a part of my morning routine. i usually just get a drip, but if i'm feeling frisky i'll get a pour over. the staff is always friendly and it's a nice place to sit down for a few.ninth stop on chicago caffeine crawl.gaslight, oh gaslight. you are perfect. you have so many dead animals lying around that even a hunk of roadkill would feel at home here. so many hipsters flock to your premises that you could put a hipster factory out of business. and there are more human hands in jars here than i have ever seen anywhere else. thank you for being who you are.doesn't it sound wonderful? for real, it is. so wonderful in fact that i had to stop here again on the way back through chicago. of the eleven coffee shops i went to in chicago, this was my favorite. favorite by a slight margin over other places but favorite nonetheless. the first time was early in the morning, right after it opened. it was very calm and peaceful at that hour, with all the soft colors and natural materials. my pour-over was a winner in my book. in fact it won a prize for being slightly better than any other coffee i had in chicago. maybe it was because it was the next morning and i was more ready for coffee again. and i'm not sure where they get their pastries from but that place should get some kind of award, or at least a five star review. canelé and almond croissant. the next time was around noon and man it was hopping, with an incredibly high hipster to other people ratio. i got a fairly great espresso pulled on the la marzocco strada. i also picked up a bag of in house roasted ethiopian beans for home use. **warning- blunt ending approaching** it turned out decently in aeropress and siphon, even though it seemed like i had a hard time getting proper body out of it or something. the baristas were cool.i came just to get coffee and ended up with more! love this place! the staff are friendly. keep up the good work ladies!i could stash my bike inside here, something i appreciated. enamelware water cups. skeleton hand in a jar. gaslight has its own distinctive face.this was my first ever coffee in chicago. guatemala macchiato.when i came back a few days later for an ethiopian macchiato, it really was as good as i remembered! gaslight is an extra special coffee memory.staff threw my drink away. then had to wait over 20 minutes for them to remake it. too loud. fail.time number 2 was even better than the first. i did a couple things different this time. i dressed down, and i paid with exact change. i stopped off i at kmart on my way in from ohare and spent $16 on a black hoodie and paired it with a pair of dark blue ag jeans. this time not only did the skinny guy behind the counter laugh at my joke, 2 patrons smiled at me. wearing a suit the first time was a mistake. i noticed this time that not only do they have bike parking on the sidewalk ( which is probably due to the city, not the store)  they allow you to pile your bike up just inside the door as well. this is handy if you don't want your to get cold or wet. i'd like to see them institute valet parking for bicycles.  if i go through the effort of riding my bike down there, i'd like to have some greet me, take my bike and then bring up to the door when i'm done. i did venture into the restroom on this visit. when i opened the door i was not surprised by the vintage black and white tile on the floor, but the low wattage lighting threw me a bit. the toilet seat was down and it had not been fished by the pervious guest. i was confused at first and worried that i was in the wrong room. because there's was a single swath of tp floating in the dark yellow aftermath. clearly the patrons need to stay more hydrated. the urine was level 4 on my unhealthily scale. ( 4= dehydration / poor diet) 5= possible kidney failure (6= sepsis) if you used the men's room there today, please go see your doctor. the coffee was great, the barista was skinny on top and pleasant, the crowd was warm and approachable. i highly recommend it. again.great coffee shop! i came here for the first time with my sister-in-law. the service was friendly and efficient. we split one of the savory scones- delicious. i also had the colombian coffee pour over which i would highly recommend. it was really smooth and flavorful. the croissants and other pastries looked delicious as well. i'll definitely return to this coffee shop next time i'm in the area!hipster coffee shop. enough said.came here on a sunday afternoon - packed! took 10min to wait for a seat. parking took awhile as well. pretty small place with lots of windows. great staff. pretty good tea! reminds me a little of worm hole in wicker park.i ordered 2 lattes and a cheese and herb scone. the lattes were good but that scone was such a rip off!! it was so nasty and dry and tasted awful. took a bite and that was all i could beari love this place! the people here are friendly, and the coffee is great.we stopped by this place to grab some coffee, mostly because it looked really cute from the outside (helpful, right?). it was a pretty cozy setting on the inside, so if you're looking for some place quiet, its good to get some work done. however, they don't have very much seating. i got a small chai to go, and i was kind of disappointed. mostly because it was more expensive than starbucks and the small was tiny! i would understand if the quality was much better, but i didn't really think so. they were also very very slow.. my drink took about 5 minutes, and there was no one ahead of me. my friend also ordered when i did, and after about 10 minutes we decided to ask what was taking so long for his drink. i guess they forgot to make it.. so we waited about another 5 minutes for his drink. if you're in a rush, this probably isn't the best place to stop for a quick bit of caffeine..i've been coming to gas light for as long as they can remember. the product is honestly the tastiest i can get my nose and tongue involved with, throughout this entire city. recommend: cold brew or their matcha green tea (iced for a pretty and refreshing drank) the cool-kids that have worked there in the past, and who work there presently, care about what they do; not only roasting and creating the best coffee they can, but also their daily interactions with every-single-customer. also, the owners are quite special and are by far the hippest cats 'round.such an awesome space, the interior is beautiful. i just got a drip coffee, i was hoping to get a pastry but i was greeted by only two sad looking croissants during my 6pm visit. note to self and others: come early for pastries. mediocre service, fast wifi, i'll be returning!this cafe is a hip gem in the trendy logan square district. everything here is done just right for their feel and demographic. the pour-overs are slowly crafted to perfection, and served by friendly baristas. their food is brought to you in vintage enamelware with cloth towel napkins that are freshly laundered. the ingredients are artisanal, and prepared to hearty, wholesome perfection. the decor is industrial, casual, and a hint grungy. the music selection is also spot-on!the ambiencevery funky looking place. really random stuffed animals around from a duck to a rabbit decorate the place. the place is not crazy packed and ample street parking around. it seems somewhat hip but i really think the high school chairs should be changed out into something a little nicer. was kind of strange that they write orders with a sharpie on the counter.the food.drinki had a decent tree called the really green tea which i thought was green tea but looked super green. did not taste like green tea and it was ok.eati had their house special for breakfast. i was bummed they didn't serve the lunch before 11 but it was still pretty good. it was a piece of bread with goat cheese i think topped with bacon and an egg. i had no idea how to eat it without it turning into a crazy mess. it also came with a salad with some sliced cumquats. overall it seemed ok - i don't think the bread part is really needed - it kind of made it hard to eat.the servicethe line was fairly short on a sunday morning and the tea made it out in seconds but the sandwich was more like 15+ min. everyone was really nice and friendly. overall pretty chill place and would love to try it for lunch.very good espresso today. this is on a corner and if you're into wood floors & brick walls....this is the place. the coffee  (chemex) was as good as inteligencia, but cheaper.really, really fantastic coffee that is roasted fresh in house.  however, every time i come in here i feel like i'm not cool enough to stay long. i guess that's alright, i don't own a macbook anyway.  it's like they know i'm a dork from the suburbs who drives an hour into logan square for a drink and $15 of coffee to take home. but it is my favorite coffee and well worth an hour drive into the city.sf has lots of coffee.  i'm a bit sick of coffee snobs.  and coffee joints with their "special" ways of making coffee.came here and was wowed by the huge ceilings, the roomy workspaces, and the weird game on the walls.  (they had a spray-painted gold goose that was real, stuffed rabbit, pheasant (?), and a deer (?) head, and a jarred human hand skeleton).it felt like any snobbish coffee joint. but. the coffee was fresh. had all the flavor notes they advertised (took a sip of c's).  my tea was perfect (rooibos).  and j claims that espresso was crazy.  they gave water to cleanse the palate  before he had his espresso... but he said he needed that water as a chaser. haha.anyway, really great coffee.  regret not buying the beans.they forgot to make my hot cocoa once and one of the girls gave me a free pastry for the inconvenience #goodservicethe music is a little too much and loud, i usually go there to study so that's a bit of a disturbance.. overall though, love everything... everything is clean and nice looking, and great coffee :) i wish they opened earlier and maybe remained open until midnight like the wormholewhat a gem. easily one of the best spaces in the city and a terrific roaster to boot. the coffee shop is right in the heart of the gentrification surrounding logan square but i definitely don't feel put off by the people who come here or work here - they are great.people love gathering here and working here. the windows really make this place feel much more pleasant than some of the other spaces on the milwaukee corridor. there's usually a place to get some work done if you go on a non-weekend day and even on saturdays and sundays, it is still a 80% chance of locking down a place to do work. i'll be coming back again and again, no doubt. floriole bakery pastries and a good cup of coffee are instant tickets for repeat customers.a deer head hanging on the wall.  tables that look like 2x4 beams nailed together without a finishing lacquer.chairs that look like they were stolen from your middle school from back in the 1990's.yep, this is your neighborhood hipster coffee shop.i had a cookie with a pretzel placed in the middle, and it was quite good.  my friend had a chai tea latte, and he drank all of his, so i assumed that he must have liked it.there are a fair amount of people reading actual books here, so 5 stars for the literacy rate of the community here!  (i don't mean to sound elitist, but i'm a fan of reading!)summary - gaslight is the best spot in logan square for anything from a quick pick-me-up, great bite to eat, to a full day working session. gaslight absolutely nails the coffee shop trifecta:1. ambiance = chill, hipster, productive2. food = several options, all fantastic3. coffee = delicious, unique, and always freshly made right in front of yougaslight is my "home office" away from home. i work from here every friday when i am in the area (typically ~4 hours). i start off with a drip coffee or a latte and work for a couple hours at a table next to large windows letting in lots of natural light (always helpful when working). i order something off the breakfast menu - typically the meat and potato bowl that's tasty and filling - and work for a few more hours.gaslight is my ideal friday workstation - great coffee, food, and ambiance. hope the word does not spread too quickly and all the tables fill up :)cool, hipster coffee shop. came here with my friend to study. seating was a little difficult to find; luckily we didn't have to wait extremely long for one. my friend and i both ordered the latte. the art was on point . taste was ok. overall, atmosphere was nice for chatting or studying. free wifi was available!i was in chicago for a week and worked remotely from a bunch of local coffeeshops. this was easily my favorite. i went to wormhole (wh), caffe streets (cs), and a few others. those other two were still very good coffeeshops, and i would definitely return, but i'll try to enumerate here why gaslight was my favorite.- the coffee was the best. had pourover and a cortado here. it wasn't miles ahead of the other places, but it was better.- the server dudes were super nice. it looked like a place i'd love to work. (wh staff was also really awesome too, though).- music was the best - started with nice, unobtrusive, but interesting ambient and moved on to elliott smith. wh was a bit more in-your-face with lo-fi 90s punk.- the food was delicious. i had a turkey/bacon thingy on foccacia. great and only $7.- lots of seating with bountiful plugs. definitely more than either wh or cs.finally, i'll say that each of these places had its own distinct vibe. if i had to sum them each up for the purposes of comparison, i'd say wh is punky/trashy (in a good way), cs is upscale modern (also in a good way), and gaslight is upscale vintage (in the best way possible). it's like a very very well done etsy store or a hipster shop in sf's mission district that sells nothing in particular. (again, in the best way possible).walking distance from my house, you can catch me here sipping a glass of their cold brew on a hot and humid day. the crowd here is very "hipster". the baristas are extremely helpful and make very good suggestions. great quality coffee at a decent and reasonable price. i almost always order the cold brew, bring my laptop and a book and spend the afternoon, happy. i also frequently buy beans to bring home so i can make a mean cup of coffee in the morning. overall awesome ambiance, location, and most importantly, coffee.i'm not sure why i waited so long to review this place, but hey, better late than never.  gaslight coffee roasters is one of my favorite places in logan square, and easily one of the best coffee spots in the city.  perfect espresso shot every time.  i know this may sound like a simple task, but for me, a perfectly pulled shot of espresso is one of the most simple yet delicious things in the world.  unfortunately, in this starbuckdonalds culture it's not often appreciated or done correctly.  but let it be known, baristas and coffee roasters at gaslight coffee roasters, i appreciate you!gaslight,you make me feel like i'm living a hipster's dream. i like this place. it's clean, it's sleek, it's very appealing to my senses. i instantly regretted not bringing my laptop and stuff with me so i could work. it has a very "hipster" ambiance with the birds everywhere and the taxidermy this and taxidermy that-- but i liked the feel of it. wooden tables, silver interior. whoever designed this place did a great job. apparently they roast the coffee in house (or share a roaster with wormhole, i think?) i don't really coffee unless i really feel the urge-- but i liked their tea. and their pastries. and their sandwiches, though i feel like it could have more flavor. but that could just be because i picked the wrong one. their sandwich was an amazing deal at $6, because it was big and i was stuffed! they also have great pastries. i ate a flaky strawberry "pop tart" that tasted delicious. there are some reviews that the staff is rude, etc. but you have to be aware that you're dealing with hipsters, and honestly? the staff that was on duty the day i went was fine. the guy at the counter seemed to be friendly, made some suggestions when i asked about food, and didn't give me attitude...i like this place, but not enough to give it 5 stars, i'm afraid.when i was around 13 years old we went on a family vacation to boston.  while visiting the boston common my father excitedly glimpsed a group of hippies, something he had not yet seen in the midwest.  "quick" he commanded, "go stand in front of the hippies so i can get their picture."  i tried to distance myself from him and my younger sister who was obediently posing and the young people approached them.   i remember that event as the single most embarrassing moment of my childhood.    i flashed back to that moment when we were in gaslight coffee roasters.  we had come for the coffee and encountered  a hipster clubhouse.  my dad and my sister were actually more welcomed by the young hippies than we were here.  take it from me, trio of mom, grandma and 1 month old are not wanted here by the regulars.  we sat by ourselves and the baby was absolutely fine but it wasn't comfortable.  on the bright side, the vanilla latte was very smooth and delicious.  we split a terrific sandwich, meats and cheeses on a crunchy, yummy baguette.  as we were finishing up, i said to my daughter, "here, hold the baby so i can get a picture of you."  she only laughed because she had heard the boston story and knew what i was trying to do.   ha, busted and i had become my father.if i happened to be in the area, i would probably get a coffee to go.  or maybe not.  it was really mellow coffee but the unwelcoming vibe was bitter indeed.i love this place's coffee and grilled cheese sandwich! excellent quality and amazing flavor.  the only thing i dislike from this cafe is the poor customer service. the cashiers are not really friendly. the food takes forever to be delivered and they only serve them after 10:00 am.wünderbar!!! such a nice atmosphere. beleza. gostei muito. perfect place to read, chat with a friend, or drink some good tea or coffee. music is always on point. maningue nice, gaslight! valeugreat place to study!  i loved the open space and background music.  fantastic chai also.  i do wish they had a wider selection for their coffees though.  they have only had a colombian roast available when i have come in.  otherwise, the staff is great to give you a smile and put the time into making a great cup!i love the coffee.  i hate how they have re-appropriated parts of black and southern culture as their design kitsch.every time i walk in here i have the sudden and overwhelming urge to pull a taxidermy duck off the wall and hurl it at a hipster.  then rip the board listing weaves and relaxers with their prices off the wall and go wwe style on someone....then i get a coffee... a delicious coffee... and just like that i mellow out and consider that the jail time probably isn't worth it.just what is it that you want to do?  do you want to kick start your morning with some high quality caffeine?  or do you want an overall breakfast experience?  if it is the former, gaslight works just fine, for the coffee is superb.  well balanced and earthy, it isn't as rich as french roast or sumatra, but it will start your engine without making you feel wired, like that chemically infused nonsense from starbucks.  the drip coffee is pricy but worth it.  i did not try the pour over style, which threatens to be even pricier.however, i must warn you away from the breakfasts in the strongest terms.  the "to go" breakfast is advertised as a hard boiled duck egg, baguette, soft cheese, and seasonal fruit.  i assumed this would be a breakfast sandwich, with the egg sliced on a substantial baguette, slathered in cheese and garnished with fruit. you may, at this time, wish to insert the usual snark about what happens when you assume, and i will have to concede your point.  the reality is that you get a small slice of less than fresh baguette, a whole boiled duck egg, a dollop of cheese, and some sorry sliced fruit.  i love derrida but he has no business deconstructing my breakfast.  to add insult to injury, the duck egg was bland and the cheese a bit too, shall we say, aromatic? for a morning sandwich.so, learn from my mistakes and stick with the coffee.  aesthetically, the store has a northwoods thing going on, but the furniture and chairs are straight out of middle school shop class.  not a very comfortable place to linger, which is unfortunate.  but i did learn one valuable lesson, which is never boil a duck egg.  it sucks all the flavor out of it.  frying is definitely the way to go with that fowl, my friends.four stars for coffee, one for food and decor.popped in for a drip coffee and beans on sunday morning. was expecting to be blown away from all of the positive reviews, but was just underwhelmed. gaslight decor is hip, but austere and somewhat cold feeling. a horned animal hangs on a wallpapered wall, with long tables and benches- more gastropub than cozy coffee hangout.looking for their whole bean coffee, which i assumed to be their specialty, i had to be directed to the small display against the wall of a few picked-over  bags of only three varieties. no descriptions of the coffees whatsoever on the display or bags. i know enough about coffees to avoid the crisp latin americans and headed for the ethiopian. $17 for less than 16 oz. seems steep. (no pun intended).i'm a small batch coffee drinker. i love my alterra, intelligentsia, dark matter, i know what good coffee tastes like. the coffee at gaslight is good, but not $17 good...ordered the one drip coffee they had available that i did not see advertised anywhere, and also told they could do any of their coffees via cone drip process. i'd love to watch coffee drip, if perhaps the place wasn't so sterille, not exactly comfy. i guess for this coffee roasting business model i prefer caffe streets, star lounge, to the sterile, hip, expensive gaslight coffee roasters. i'm sure i'll get lots of hate mail from newbie logan squarians now.love the wooden tables, the grade school seats and the folky music playing. plenty of outlets and great vibes, nice place to come and study, quality coffee.i went to gaslight recently for my second time. and i can't remember the coffee tasting so bad. i've had bad coffee in my life but this was seriously one of my worst experiences. i took a sip and had to pour it out. hopefully it will taste better next timethere's a reason why intelligentsia is at the top of the coffee  rankings in the us, and dare i say the world. the hype is real and everyone should know it. coffee offerings rotate depending on the season but the staples are like all the other intelligentsia locations. everything is freshly made, including the basic coffee. so be patient while they do a pour over. they also offer alternatives like soy and oat milk. yes i said oat milk. the baristas are excellent now and quite friendly if you're into communicating before your caffeine. good and quick service any time of the day. as you enter in the merch and bagged coffee is on the right before you hit the counter. the coffee offering list is posted on the wall to the right of where you place your order. still not sure what to order? just ask. the biggest problem about this location is seating. while there is plenty of it at the communal table and smaller tables, this location is just busy. am i complaining? not at all! there are outlets around the perimeter inside but sometimes snagging a seat on the wall can be difficult, especially in the mornings when everyone is going to work. hey, we all need our fix.always a pleasure coming to this intelli location, it's perhaps my favorite one in the city cause it's quite spacious and love the interior.had coffee with my friend juan 6:30 this morning, and being here early in the morning is super chill.we both had a pour-over and i think it's worth the extra couple of bucks compared to other coffee shops. if you are a coffee connoisseour, worth every penny. very rich and refreshing to have in the morning. baristas were friendly, nothing to complain. overall a great experience at one of the best coffee spots in the city!while this is a short walk from me and a cute interior, the coffee is pretty pricey and the staff is not very friendly. gets pretty crowded during the day and minimal outlets are available.  with lots of coffee shops in the area, not my go-to spot.good coffee, but slightly steep prices. this is definitely a coffee shop where you pay a bit more for quality and nicer ambiance. they're doing something right here because this place is continually busy and has a steady influx of customers coming in. despite the busy atmosphere, this coffee shop is a well run ship and drinks are served quickly and tables are kept clean. you'll see a combo of studiers/people who linger here as well as people who just stop by for a quick drink. this cafe has nice big windows that lets in lot of natural light and the minimalistic table and chairs are just comfortable enough to get some work done without wanting to be here all day. there are also ample plugs all around the shop for those who need to recharge their laptops or cell phones. again, this is set up in a great area and caters to multitude of people looking for a quick stop for coffee or looking for a busy coffee shop atmosphere to do some work. they also have a small outdoor seating area for those with pets or wanting to enjoy some fresh air with their coffee.ah, 7 months after my chicago trip and i'm finally doing a review on intelligentsia.. whoops. my boyfriend and i arrived in chicago around noon time from what i remember, but we weren't able to check into the airbnb till 3pm so he looked up this coffee place in order to kill time. and my boyfriend is a coffee nut so intelligentsia interested him with the good reviews. our lyft driver dropped us off here and luckily the place wasn't packed with people so we were able to chill off to the side of the store with all our luggage. i ended up getting their matcha latte while my boyfriend opted for their coffee and we were able to use the free wifi offered here in order to look up more places to visit in chicago. the people working here were friendly and didn't seem annoyed that we were dragging in hella baggage which i'm grateful for because it was a cold day and if they had kicked us out... well, damn. but they didn't so yay. my latte was a bit more bitter than what i was used to so i was a bit meh on it, but my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy their coffee. he even bought a few bags of their coffee bean when we went home to california, lol.my old review needs an update.  service speed has improved dramatically over time, which was a major gripe.  service is usually pretty friendly, and i do like the layout of the store.  but seats aren't very kind to your tush, so don't plan to camp out too long. the outdoor space that the city plopped on milwaukee is pretty cool and is a nice place to camp out when the weather is nice.coffee and pastries are good.  for sure a step up from starbucks, but coffee is definitely not in the top 3 in the city. if you are feeling decadent, have the milkshake.  its out of this world.so apparently intelligentsia is all the rage and i had no idea there was one 2 blocks from my apartment (i think paying for coffee is stupid). we were walking to the starbucks on division and my boyfriend stopped dead in his tracks when he saw there was an intelligentsia. his drink: mocha latte with a cute heart shaped pattern thing (whatever that is called)my drink: chi lattevote: his was better right off the bat. i didn't care much for mine so i stuck it in the fridge and it was great as a cold latte (i tend to like my caffeine cold anyway)consensus: maybe i'll be back but again, i have a hard time justifying paying $5 for a coffee when i have my k cups at home. this is no dig on the establishment just not really my thing. but this place is always busy which means they are doing something right.i'm not a coffee drinker so my review might be a bit skewed since it's a coffeeshop. instead of coffee i got a match latte which was gorgeous but the flavor was a lacking. it wasn't that sweet and an almost overpowering matcha taste which gave it a bitter aftertaste. i did end up drinking it all because it cost $6.  the place itself is very cute however. great for getting some work done with big windows that let in a lot of natural light. it's smaller and quieter like most coffee shops and despite the latte i would definitely come again!bad customer services good coffee. really like the decor. bread is pretty good. cold brew coffee is my go tothere is no better coffee in the world than intelligentsia. i'm sure that kopi luwak is great, but i don't wanna pay $100 to eat monkey poop. the absolute best is flecha roja, which is normally in season around may thru december. this coffe is so delicious, it has a sweet finish that requires no sugar or cream to bastardize perfection.the barisatas are all helpful when you want to try new bean selections, and they make the perfect espresso.the location is steps from the division st blue line, and they also have parking. the inside is a beautiful combination of glass, cement, and wood interiors. more importantly, they have free wifi, and plenty of seating to lounge around.$9 for a 12 oz drip and a pastry.  i could get a full diner breakfast, omelet,  hash browns, toast and a bottomless coffee for $10. and don't cast me off as someone who just doesn't get coffee culture. i get it.i love their space. but i am just not into the fact that i have to pay above $5 for coffee. once i got a cold matcha and i nearly paid $8 with tips. in term of the drinks, i had better ones elsewhere.loved the interior design, friendly and quick service. some coffee beverages can be improved over others though.ordered a 12oz soy latte and loved it! the foam on top was light and fluffy. the soy milk shined through the espresso flavors wonderfully. the latte was smooth and just warmed me up perfectly! i enjoyed my soy latte until the very last drop! the cold brew we also ordered was just alright. it wasn't as strong as the others we have had at all. even before the ice melted, the cold brew was already very diluted and just didn't pack the punch like other cold brews. the flavors weren't very robust, but it was refreshing! this cold brew was more easy to drink in comparison to others, so if that's what you're looking for, an iced coffee, then this is for you.i can't believe i just paid $4.50 for a middle-of-the road ice coffee . this place would do well to charge more reasonable prices.you really can't call intelligentsia pretentious just because the baristas have dark rimmed glasses and beards.  or because the coffee is $4.00+ per cup.  or because the seating area has a minimalist, void feeling.  you just can't.the baristas are nice and properly described the seasonal mocha to us, which was made with a little bit of malt powder.  they also answered my friend's 1,000 questions about where they buy their white coffee cups, and what could she order to get her drink in one?the seasonal mocha was outstanding.  coffee here is made with tlc.  the chairs in the seating area are deceptively comfortable.  the pistachio croissant was okay, a few dollars too expensive, but damn i was hungry.i felt a proper caffeine buzz several hours later.i had a mixed experience here today. i got a latte, which was very good. zero complaints on that (except that the latte art wasn't as impressive as other intelligentsia locations, but that's total nitpicking and has nothing to do with the great taste). we also were able to find seating right away in the middle of the day on a saturday, which is something that's usually pretty difficult to do in wicker park. additionally, we were in close enough distance to an outlet to plug in. score! however, there were a few issues, the largest of which was that it was very cold inside. today was warmer than it's been most of the winter so far (about 40 degrees), so i wonder if they thought they didn't need to have the heat on anymore due to it being relatively warmer. whatever the case was, it was very drafty and uncomfortable. maybe we had the worst of it being under some kind of vent with a fan, but we had to wear our coats inside for the few hours we spent here while working on our laptops. i noticed that the people sitting next to us also had their coats on. also (and this isn't as big of a deal), but the space is sort of cramped and awkward particularly when power chords are involved. there were two women in there with strollers and i had to unplug my chord so they could get by. i'm not quite sure why the outlets aren't underneath the tables.  all in all, it was an a-ok experience. assuming the cold temperature was just a one-time, irregular time, then i would totally come back. my latte was honestly fantastic, and being able to find a seat with ease something i really value. if the temperature is all good the next time i return, then i'll update my review.visiting intelligentsia has become a routine on my days off from work.  i discovered this location when i was looking at several properties in the west town/wicker park neighborhoods.  if you often feel the ones in the loop area are too crowded and lack sufficient seating, this intelligentsia has along-the-wall indoor and outdoor bench seating, a plenty of lighting through large windows, and friendly and gregarious baristas.  their iced chai was done right, so was daddy j.'s americano.  this probably is my favorite intelligentsia location, for its conveniently located within walking-distance from the cta division blue line station, #9 (ashland), #56 (milwaukee), and #70 (division) buses.  therefore, north-siders, west-siders, and south-siders are all certainly welcome.  their decors and choices of furniture are simple, modern, and space-conscious.  come, enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, and relax your mind!  patronizing intelligentsia is the most inexpensive retail therapy one can have in the city: all you need is $5.supposedly decent coffee but terrible rude service and inconsistent delivery. would probably give even fewer stars were it not for their reputation.without a doubt this is my favorite coffee shop in chicago. i love their iced oat milk lattes! the baristas are the best; they remember my order and exactly how i like each drink i order from there. the iced matcha with oat milk and honey is another great option if you don't want coffee!a coffee shop in my neighborhood (wicker park) with a parking lot? count me in! i started visiting this place based on the simple fact that they had a place for me to park and it has quickly a weekly visit for me.  the folks that run this location are attentive, friendly and always care to ask me how my day is going no matter how busy they are.  it's nice to see this level of personalism with a company like intelligentsia that has really blown up exponentially over the years.  if you get here early enough to get a spot (seating is slightly limited), it's a nice space to to do work - their interior is really inviting and warm.  i love this spot.i was so excited to finally try intelligentsia coffee after hearing about them for years.  i arrived early sunday morning on mother's day and they were giving away a free flower to all women ... either to recognize them as mothers or to give it to their mothers.  this is a thoughtful touch. the cafe itself is bright, open, and have a few tables and chairs to sit.  in general, great atmosphere and their service was friendly enough. the barista helped me choose the right coffee for me as i described my preferred type... medium bold with low acidity.  i got the coffee and walked out the door when i took my first sip.  it ... was not good.  it was quite confusing.  it was heavily diluted while still having a strong vinegar note and a slight bitter note.  i gave it to my friend to try and seeing their reaction, i knew this wasn't my imagination.  i attempted to drink it again and couldn't.  i eventually opened the cup and noticed there was a decent amount of grinds and yet somehow the coffee was light in colour.  i'm sure this was a mistake ... i ended up throwing it away after the 2 sips.  we ended up going to gaslight roasters down the street.  they had a good coffee but their service wasn't good.perhaps i'll give intelligentsia another chance next time but it's hard when you have bowtruss and caffe umbria as its competitors.imagine this true scenario:just landed at midway airport. awake since 3am et. more hungry than thirsty, more tired than hungry, more impatient than tired. final destination is 20-75 minutes in the opposite direction of this particular intelligentsia which is currently 27 minutes away not counting the unpredictable traffic or crusty weather. after grabbing a rental vehicle, the obvious decision on where to go next is made....which is this intelligentsia, obviously. my fave intelligentsia on randolph doesn't have easy enough parking.anyone that complains about matters inconsequential to the coffee lacks appreciation for the, at times, inconvenient reality of chasing expertly created espresso.first time stopping by and i must say it will be my last the red head cashier was just plan rude not friendly at all!$3.91 for a small coffee? you've got to be kidding me. the coffee was nice, the facility was clean and wonderful. but 4 dollars, 5 with tip, for a 10oz coffee is insane. when did this become a thing?you should really change your hours to "when our baristas feel like opening" i came after 7 am on a saturday and the guy inside rudely shhaked his head and went back to what he was doing. maybe my skin color doesn't represent an acceptable customer to buy your ridiculously overpriced drinks. so i will stop buying this brand altogether. i know there are much better brands out there.one of the best coffee places in chicago.the baristas are friendly and actually seem interested in the customer. had the cortado and a chemex cause it was just that kind of day.wife had the vanilla latte cause she's got to have something sweet.atmosphere is inviting for both people that come here to get work done and those that come to just talk and chill!incredible coffee but $4.50 for a 16oz...that's steep compared to others in the area. great coffee shop and vibe for wicker parklove having an intelligentsia in wicker park.every time i go in here, the baristas couldn't possibly be nicer. they are always asking me about my day, my plans, etc...even when i look like i woke up about 7 minutes before i entered their shop. i really appreciate how friendly they are especially on a busy chicago corner.the coffee is top notch. i wish they had skim milk (eye roll from my husband) but i appreciate that they value their coffee flavor so much that they choose not to offer skim milk. if they feel that strongly about it, that's fine with me.the interior is easy and not pretentious. one large communal table, a full window bench seating area, and lots of extra seating on interesting looking orange blocks. an easy place to take a cup to go or enjoy a great conversation.damn their matcha latte is incredible. everyone has always been super friendly upon walking in. i've never had a bad cup of coffee here either. this is my ultimate favorite place to get coffee or matcha lattes on the go. i do wish it was less expensive, but it's totally worth every penny.superb! the quality of the coffee cannot be matched. i got the cappuccino and it was divine. excellent espresso. perfect velvety foam.onsistantly good coffee. inteligencia is becoming a regional starbucks, without reducing quality. they're clearly doing the right thing. i had a bolivian kalita todsy, good yet not off the charts.great coffee. my bf had a conference call during our trip so we stopped by this place mainly for the internet. i got the latte (latte leaf art hehe) and i think it was an almond croissant. both were delicious and hit the spot on the rainy day. (what a crazy weekend of weather that labor day weekend.... it was blazing hot and humid and then it was storming and raining. geez)workers were friendly bathroom was clean shop was decorated in a hipster fresh way conveniently across the street from the train stationi love intelligentsia. i'm sure it was just this particular barista, but my coffee was not hot, warm as best.really friendly, and smaller than i'd have thought, given their fame. when i walked in every employee working that day greeted me and asked how i was. my coffee was ready in moments. yes, the small latte is small, but really that just means they use less milk. the coffee taste was more robust than, say, the latte i got the day before from dark matter. i don't do a $4 coffee every day, but this is as good as any. oh, i don't think they had any fun lattes (like, say, ipsento), it's more of a coffee purist place.oh, and they have a discount for cyclists, which i love. although only sometimes apparently, because i biked back a few days later and no discount.best espresso i've ever had. i always make a point to get a cup when i'm in town. the staff at this particular location are very friendly as well!i needed a coffee for work and saw this place around the corner. the walls were lined with expressionless people staring at whatever screen was in their hands. "i'll have a large coffee and one pastry please." $10 for a coffee and pastry.for half the price you can go across the street and get fresh made from a local bakery (shout out to sweet cakes)why would anyone pay that much for anything. may be to match the inflation of rent in the neighborhood?it comes with a pat on the back and a side of knowing you are better than everyone else that can't afford to drink here.perhaps i am an ignorant goon that doesn't get it. what am i missing? skip this place. shop mom an pop.the coffee was okay.  they had intriguing tools you could use to brew your own coffee the intelligentsia way at home.  coffee pots and weird shaped funnels.  the pricing is pretty expensive.   the ambiance was a little bare but tolerable.the coffeewatch out wormhole, filter, caffe streets, and ipsento, intelligentsia has arrived!!! hands down, this is third wave coffee at its finest. the coffee here is impeccable! it's smooth, creamy, and the notes are so on point. i got the matalapa el salvador - i tasted a floral essence with hints of honey, which was simply divine. no cream or sugar needed. however, expect to wait longer than your normal starbucks time and to pay a little more ($4/cup), but for true coffee lovers - this is the best new thing to come to wicker park. note that soy milk is actually free, which is really great for all the vegan loving hipsters in wicker.the ambiancethis place is very modern and warm with large windows allowing the fresh sunshine to come in and wake up the customers if the coffee doesn't do the trick. it is lined with plastic red boxes used as stools, long black tables for community sharing, and lit with rows of lights dangling from the ceiling. it is quite small but it looks like there is free wi-fi and multiple places to sit to get some work done. the tables were displayed with fresh fragrant bouquets of beautiful flowers, so nice that they look like centerpieces at a reception. i hope these will always be there! the servers are all very friendly and look like they enjoy what they are doing. there are multiple french presses, scales, coffee, and t-shirts for sale. all in all, this place makes me really happy and i am so happy to welcome them to the neighborhood!$7 for a small matcha latte -i'm sorry i'm a coffee and tea lover but that price is outrageous. also, the only menu they have is a small menu at the counter and when you step up they make you feel pressured to place your order. put a menu up if you want people to be prepared. with all the coffee shops in this neighborhood-save yourself some cash and go elsewhere.intelligentsia. the queen of coffee.my macchiato was intelligentsia's black cat classic espresso blend. complex; a higher class of coffee. it was faultless. served in a red, red room, with sparkling water.in spite of aristocratic surroundings, i received no snobbery of the baristas. they were wonderfully helpful and friendly.as good as all other intelligentsia locations. really good coffee and super friendly staff.came in here for a hot chocolate and coffee today. i clearly asked please for soy milk in the hot chocolate. low and behold about an hour later i was violently ill. the barista absolutely put regular milk instead of soy in the hot chocolate. please be more careful in the future guys.i was looking forward to this opening for a long time. it's a modern, but still warm and beautiful space. i go 4 or 5 times a week in the morning to grab my morning coffee and i have always been happy. everyone who works there is extremely nice and helpful. the coffee is always amazing, and i especially love mornings when i can stay and they serve my coffee with additional carafe on the side to refill. it may seem a little expensive for coffee, but it reality the time and effort they put into it makes it worth it.delicious coffee and super friendly staff. i can't wait to go back for another coffee!!!nice small modern location. we took a short coffee break here during our shopping. the espresso i ordered tasted strong enough. the crowd was pretty young, and mostly busy on their macbooks or iphones. coffee was served decently fast. if anything it's not really a place to relax and unwind because of the setup and size of this location. but that's ok, we didn't go there to relax, we just wanted a coffee.i like the people who work at this location, as they're always friendly. however, $4 for a decent 6oz  cappuccino is outrageous. you can find better coffee for cheaper elsewhere in the neighborhood.thanks to matt for the awesome pick me up this morning! i'm here a few times a week and the coffee is always delicious and the faces always friendly. you guys just made a loyal customer today. thank you!coffee was decent though strong, cappucino was good. vibe was a little standoff-ish, like trying too hard to be cool. not a lot of seating and most of it was taken up by people camped out with computers. overall, an ok experience but a bit over-hyped.top notch coffee, friendly baristas and an urban atmosphere. the pastries (had the croissant) were excellent as well. flaky with generous fillings. tip: if you buy a bag of coffee, they knock $3 off your cup of coffee. whole foods also sells intellgentsia coffee, but the shop has more variety.some of the best chai lattes in chicago. my only wish is that they had a cinnamon shaker to add some on the top of the foam. other than that perfect. great pastries and rad seating.i stopped here after a night shift to pick up coffee beans for the next few weeks. the staff was friendly and helped me pick the best option for me.  you apparently get a free coffee drink whenever you buy a bag! since i didn't want caffeine at that point they made me a chocolate ganache hot cocoa.  to die for! i hadn't been to this location but have long been a fan of intelligentsia- great stop!this place is pretentious and paying $4.00 + tax for a small 12 oz. cup  of coffee is ridiculous. they also don't have skim milk, they only carry 2% and soy (which women shouldn't be drinking soy milk anyway, look it up.)  unwelcoming, cold and sterile room with bizarre chunks of red plasti-wood tables.  not impressed at all and certainly won't be back.  i'm surprised the hipsters who live off of pbr can afford to come here.i'm a coffee snob and wanted to try intelligentsia while i was visiting chicago. the coffee and espresso were excellent, as i had expected. the really great bonus was how lovely and kind the people were!it's intelligentsia. what can i say? over priced everything. yes their blends are good, however, their prices cater to the extremely pretentious and hipster fools. i can walk to my local grocer and get the same rich blend for half the price. that is not to say that the staff is extremely customer friendly. their pastries are bought from florial and their coffee beans are la-di-da. because they are a store front within the building i live in they get my money!great coffee. slow service. think twice if you're stopping in on your way to the airport (like i was). staff was moving at a snail pace and focused exclusively on answering a woman's endless questions about the drink in her hands rather than helping customers in line.awesome space, amazing coffee and tea, and service is solid. minus one star simply due to price but that will be the case at any intelligentsia shop. you certainly get what you pay for in service and quality.note: when you order any of the specialty coffees, you get enough for two cups! also, the pastries are really good here. like really good. not sure where they order from.simply amazing coffee. you're not going to find much in the way of starbucks-esque dessert beverages here, but with an expansive coffee, espresso, and tea menu, everyone is sure to find something they like.one star off for seating. there is just one table in the shop that seats 8 people. all of the rest of the seating is backless and tableless. i understand not wanting people to lounge in the shop forever, but the lack of tables is very inconvenient for those who stay in the shop, as all of their beverages are served on some form of platter or saucer. even tables just big enough to put one of these plates on would immensely up the experience.coffee is generally routine for me. i don't even pay that much attention to it most days. there are few enough really good coffee places around me that every time i come to chicago i have to visit intelligentsia. every time i do, that first sip is a reminder of just how damn good coffee can actually be. smooth and rich, never burnt, it's always a fantastic cup of coffee.trendy and classy upscale cafe in chicago! minimalist design, free wifi, outlets, and delicate teas.free, reliable wifi and the iced latte i had hit da spot! a great work space and although it can get busy, the noise level was always tolerable. baristas were really nice! from a previous time i've been here i can attest they have some of the best hot chocolate - not too sweet or thick, but still really flavorful!excellent beans and knowledgeable staff.yes, this place is expensive. if you want cheaper coffee, go to starbucks.intelligentsia, i love....making you at home....$4 for a cup of black coffee? i realize this is a boutique coffee place (and it's delicious), but i will stick to another local, boutique coffee shop down the street that serves bigger cups for half that price.excellent product and staff. the location is great too, right next to the blue line. the only thing that i would improve upon is the seating.you can't go there with your even small and tiny pet. even if you are holding him/her and gonna take out coffee, they make you to wait outside. i totally understand that, but when they said that, i felt like i was treated like i did something bad. one person told me my small dog is not allowed, and i told her i'm gonna take my coffee out as soon as i get it, and she said 'yes.' right after that, another person told me 'wait outside because pets not allowed' one more time infront of other people. that made me feel really bad, and i recently have never seen this in any places at all in chicago.  it is not pet friendly coffee place.i like the environment and people. the staff is awesome as well. what it don't really like is the coffee. sorry to say that but it's not a tasteful coffee. maybe i'm used to dd and done like fancy process of making a simple coffeeperfect coffee shop atmosphere. quiet enough to work but enough background noise to keep things from being awkward. as for the service, it was excellent. the baristas are very kind (pretty standard at all intelligentsias). the quality of the coffee is amazing. it's 90° so i settled for a cold brew which was wonderful. love this place, easy to get to via blue line train or division, milwaukee, or ashland bus.not a fan. i drink chai and theirs was not delicious, only served in a small size and with 2% milk. pricey, nice baristas, clean atmosphere but not super comfy.been twice now.  i feel kinda bad for the three stars since every single person working here has been absolutely lovely in total contrast to my experience at the downtown one, where i felt like constant judgment was upon me for ordering a cafe au lait instead of just straight coffee.  i got a cafe au lait  to go the first time i came here.  i tried my boyfriend's straight black coffee the second time (i can't drink straight black because of stomach problems which sucks cuz i love the taste) and it was very smooth, very light and delicious. unfortunately, it doesn't stand up well to the milk added so my au lait didn't have much flavor. plus my au lait was 5 dollas for a 12 oz drink...uh no.  the latte i had the second time was pretty good, beautiful of course but in this drink also espresso didn't stand up to the milk at all.  creamy, very little coffee taste.  so if ya want straight coffee, go for sure, some of the best in chicago, but the other drinks were meh for the price.and the seating... the seating... wtf?  am i a five year old playing with blocks?? i want a back to my chair please. or is it a table?? maybe both?? if you're gonna do experimental furniture at least make it comfortable to sit on.  or make sense at all. really, i want to love your coffee and awesome employees but my weak stomach and strong sense that a coffee shop should be at least a little comfortable leaves me at 3 stars.still confused as to why the large here is smaller than at the downtown location. i thought they may just have ran out of the bigger cups the first time but was told the second time that's just how it is here. so why would i buy it here and not downtown?a wonderful addition to this to brew up some competition in the coffee shop business in this neighborhood. the seating area is not so comfy for sitting long for hours and getting work done because of all the block like things. pastries seem overpriced. i also wish either the quantity of coffee was more or the price was slightly lower because 8oz or 10oz feels too small for the price you pay when you are used to drinking traditionally large portion sizes from coffee-chains. for the seasoned tastebuds only, not your regular coffee shop. i would recommend the gateau basque - it is out of this world!the staff is magnificent. i usually don't comment on service unless it's bad but everyone one here is a) lovely b) remembers your name c) remembers your "usual order" has it ready when you walk up. who does that anymore? i know the coffee trend is at it's peak but does that mean because we spend $5 on a coffee we still don't expect some quality service? the coffee is great, pastries from floriole standard, solid, goodness. it takes energy to be cheery all day, trust me guys...these barristas have it down pat. i forgot how it feels for someone to ask me about my day, actually catches me off guard. great addition to the neighborhood!great coffee. cute place. uncomfortable seating. loud music. friendly staff. a/c very cold but that could be specific to the day.i don't want to like this place... the hyper-modern thing doesn't fit well with the neighborhood -- and in general, intelli is def on the "snooty" side of the coffee shop world... but for good reason.  if you're looking for the best coffee product, they can't be beat. the company clearly invests heavily in quality and training. extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff. similar to their other locations, it's hands-down the most consistently fantastic coffee and espresso you'll ever have. ugggggh.this is my favorite coffee brand and the interior design are very modern. small on the inside but great service and it has a bar atmosphere. not good for a large group to gather but good for 1 or 2 people. i like all the coffee and tea.not very good. i'm sorry but its the truth. its a place for posers. the coffee is just ok with much much better alternatives close by. the coffee seems to be brewed as to be sour or weak especially at this location. the tea is improperly served and only ok quality (perhaps bc poorly made?). seats are uncomfortable and baristas are not service oriented or approachable. poor place to get work done or meet people. baked goods are sub par and only ok - they lack flavor and substance. the only positive is that it is close to the the blue line, but again it is not the only place with a decent location. there are at least three better coffee brews in walking distance (no not starbucks) and much better places to spend time (upscale or downscale). expensive for no reason, and i am upset i gave it so many chances.best mocha in chicago is at this location.  from what i was told, they switched the company that supplies the chocolate.  one sip and you will be glad that they did.i really want to give this place a four stars or higher as they moved into an area dominated by starbucks. overall, they serve a good cup o' joe and some other interesting and delicious beverages like the sparkling teas.  unfortunately, my last two visits have resulted in a near public shaming by the manager because i asked for something different about my drink and they didn't like it.  the first was a sparking iced tea where i asked for a little ice which was met by a lecture from the barista with an emphatic 'no, we don't do that because it's sparkling and not meant to be consumed that way."  the second time i went in, i ordered the same thing and when i received my drink it was a 10 oz cup with 2.5 inches of foam on my the top.  after the foam settled (i hadn't taken a drink yet) i asked the barista/manager to top it off.  the response i received was that 'the foam makes the drink and they usually leave two inches of foam.'  after staring at me for what felt like forever, the barista only agreed to top off the drink after i argued that if i'm going to pay $4.50 for a glass of sparkling tea, then i care less about the presentation and more about getting my money's worth of product.' she rolled her eyes and finally topped the drink off, but not before she got the last word in that they would do it just this once but it's not something they do.'bottom line, the drinks are good, slightly overpriced and the staff is just as pretentious as the starbucks down the street.  i may keep trying.  hopefully third time is the charm!new location to wicker park. have to have their iced coffee, its not watered down likes at most places and is very robust and bold.i was already  familiar with the coffee (el gallo and itzamna are probably my favorites) but i never pass up the opportunity to check out a coffee spot. they also have tea and a small selection of pastries. i had something similar to a muffin filled with fruit and creme fraiche. it was quite tasty. this is a nice looking spot. it has kind of a contemporary look to it. the staff was very helpful and nice too.intelligentsia, my love. i live about a block from the intelligentsia in los angeles so on a long cross country trek it was a reprieve not only to get fantastic coffee, but to get a sliver of home. the staff was lovely and friendly. and of course, the coffee was divine.great coffee, quick service.  that's exactly what i'm looking for especially when it's a $4 cup of coffee and i can go one block west and get the same thing for $1.93 at starbucks.  i like the store front and all of their neat coffee prep tools that give intelligentsia their license to sell premium coffee.  i have two simple issues with this place though.  1. change your pos system so that i don't have to finish the transaction on your ipad and have the cashier staring me down while i put "no tip" on a $4 cup of coffee that took literally 2.2 seconds to pour into a cup that you didn't even put the lid on for me.  2.  stop being so hip and cool when asking me me if i want the coffee in a mug or a to-go cup.  they always say "are you taking this away?" and it just sounds so pretentious.  cancel the creative lingo guys... and ask "for here or to go?"delicious cappuccinos and fantastic service. but they didn't have the sip lid to fit the cup my cappuccino came in, which was disappointing when you're trying to take it on the train with you.went here on a hot day after walking the 606. the iced vanilla latte and nutella latte were exactly what we needed. they were made right in front of us and tasted delicious.the staff was quite nice, one of them talked us in to trying their mini donuts (spoiler: they were delicious). we tried the cinnamon sugar and the orange lemon. super small, but they are called mini donuts. if you go after 4pm, they're half price as well!the atmosphere is really cool in there. most people had their laptops out and were working by the open windows. limited seating, but we found a place at the bar. i highly recommend.espresso served too hot, bean quality not impressive (wildfire espresso). latte art quality - fuggedaboutit.beautiful interior, great place to work. but just had to call a spade a spade on the main offering here - the coffee.jacking'em up to a four star because at the end of the day i like them and real happy they're in my hood.still question their level of hygiene. last week went there twice. both my dog and i liked what we got (he got croissants) ...coffees reasonably good, and done nicely.staff, very nice.location fabulous.nice coffee shop in the area. about a 5 minute walk from some great street art such as the chicago wall and robin williams wall. they have a fun selection of drinks. the nutella latte was delicious as expected, i just wish it had a bit more in flavor. the ispento coffee however, was my favorite and has a slight kick that really jolts you to be awake. decent prices around 4- 5 dollars and a small slection of pastries are available.really great vibes here! it's a great space with warm dark wooden finishes and lots of natural light- great for getting work done. the only thing to keep in mind is that it gets loud! they blast the music so it was a little hard for me to hear myself think, even though i usually love doing work at coffee shops. aside from that, the coffee is great! i had an herbal-tasting latte with almond milk which was very good. they also have mini donuts! i usually don't like donuts at all but these were made from sweet potato and i had to try. i think the one i tried was orange with cardamom and it was super soft and a perfect texture. what's cool about ipsento is that it has a bar too! it's a great place to come hang or catch up with friends, but when it comes to working, only come if you're able to drown out loud sounds!you know that you have some of the most special beans and brews in the city of chicago when i have to stop for one of your signature lattes just because it makes my day so so special. i wish i didn't live on the other side of the 606 trail, but that's my way of saying bring your coffee north of lawrence ave.ipsento has great coffee with creative latte options and amazing mini donuts. the staff was really nice and it has a chill atmosphere. i brought my laptop to do some work on a sunday afternoon where it was really packed. there is limited seating where i had to wait a little bit before i was able to sit at a table.i ordered the rose cardamom latte and half a dozen mini donuts. i want to be able to tell you what my favorite flavor donut was but each one was just so good. the latte? so good. a part of me wants to be fancy and be able to describe the amazing aroma/delicious flavors but you know what? unnecessary because it was just so. very. good. you just need to try it for yourself. i highly, highly recommend this coffee shop and i am definitely coming back.being a fresh meat in chi city, i was the classic hipster looking for the best coffee in the city. i was so happy to found ipsento 606.amazing selection of coffee - each cup stands up for itself and there is a wide variety of good coffee.*) the nutella latte had the perfect amount of nutella sweetness without overpowering the taste of coffee.*) the ipsento latte is no standard latte. i love that they spiked it with spices for a unique kick.*) cold brew is my go to work coffee and ipsento's did not disappoint. it's refreshing with the perfect amount of acidity - just perfect for my taste.i have to give honorable mention to their donuts. they are in adorable mini size, with the perfect amount of sweetness. my favorites are the earl grey and maple donuts.i live on the opposite side of ipsento, but because they are the kind of coffee shop that are equipped with both the love of coffee and the passion for community, i can't help but to find an excuse to swing by.my boyfriend and i come here just about every weekend for the chai latte. for those used to drinking chai from places that use concentrate, like starbucks, you'll notice this chai tastes much fresher and original. it doesn't have quite as much spice as chai usually does, but you can always add extra spice. i enjoy the freshness and unique taste this chai offers, i would definitely recommend trying it if you are looking for a real chai latte.overall this was one of the nicer cages i've been to around chicago. this is one of their few locations in the city featuring their mini bitesized doughnuts in several flavors.i decided to try their seasonal basil mint mocha drink and i was very surprised by how well everything mixed together and tasted. the latte art was prime and looked very well crafted. overall one of my hands down favorite cafes i've been to around chicago. the actual scene was quiet more in the early afternoon, but got more louder as more people came in. seating was pretty rough and got pretty crowded. there wasn't too many spots to sit to get work done but the wifi had pretty good speeds. the cafe got pretty loud and somewhat distracting but this was a saturday afternoon/evening.this place has great chai latte made with whole milk of course. also has a friendly vibe from the staff that is very welcoming. the ambience is also nicely laid out with plenty of tables to do work and strong wi-fi.some of the best coffee chi-town has to offer.  this particular location is right next to a great little park and bloomingdale trail.  very convenient for a relaxing morning!wow! this place is a must go. my friend took me here after an amazing reflexology session and i was already in a good mood but this place's latte made my day even better. i decided to go with the nutella latte, because who can resist that? my friend had the ipsento latte and we got two mini donuts that were the donut versions of our drinks. the nutella latte was nothing short of amazing; it was sweet and tasted just like nutella and gave me the perfect afternoon pick me up kick. i tried the ipsento latte and it too was delicious. it is made with cayenne and coconut and the combination creates a smooth and slightly spicy and slightly sweet taste. the mini donuts were also sooo good. i just wish they were bigger! the atmosphere of this place is clean and modern and they also serve beer and other alcoholic beverages. many people were studying while we were there. the cashier who took care of us was friendly and helpful and not pretentious at all, which was great, since this seemed like it might be the place for pretentious people. the only small complaint i have is that in  the restroom that i used the hand dryer wasn't working. other than that, i was in love with this place!best latte i've ever had. treat yourself with their nutella almond milk latte. there's space to work or meet with a friend. they have cocktails too if you want a first date spot. right underneath the 606 so you can walk after.it is the best latte i've ever had. the roast on the coffee is full bodied, smoky and mellow. good dairy, chunky ice cubes and a jar.peaceful, groovy vibe inside the joini'm dropping two stars, yes two, because of ipsento's "no laptop rule" after 7 p.m. i would respect the ipsento team so much more if they allowed me to be in a social environment and work and drink wine on a friday night - as sometimes one must do. it's very unusual to prohibit your customers from enjoying your space in a way that makes them comfortable! sometimes, forced trendiness disappoints. that in mind - ipsento has great coffee, there is no question. and if you are dropping in to grab a latte to go, you won't be disappointed. if you're looking for a spot to sit down and read or do some work, there is sufficient seating considering the size of the shop, however it's not comfortable. only one of the tables has chairs with back support - all other seating options are stools. not a huge deal, but worth keeping in mind when weighing your coffee shop options.what ipsento is doing in the city of chicago is pretty awesome. they are bringing the coffee to the people literally and allowing people to be a part of their success by crowdfunding their hopeful expansion. this location is very close to their other one, but offers a much more modern feel. the other a lot more cozy and i'd say more conducive when you're trying to get work done. each cup of coffee here can be made in the style that you prefer. really nice that it's nearby the 606, i only wish i discovered it when the weather was warmer. luckily, that seems to be around the corner. very much recommend this place to coffee lovers, also check out their lil mini doughnuts.one of the absolute cutest coffee shops i've been to in chicago!we came at happy hour and both really enjoyed our drinks. i got one with beets and my friend got a twist on a mojito. i really liked the spices in mine and appreciated the subtle beet taste. the mojito was also great and so creative! we also tried the mini donuts. this is the only thing i didn't absolutely love. we got the ipsento and the chocolate but they were both too spiced for me. however i definitely still look forward to coming back and trying more creative coffee drinks or cocktails!!based on one visit:good coffee but super slow service. it took nearly 10 minutes after ordering to get my cappuccino. not worth it for me.conveniently located at a 606 entrance, this coffee shop has plenty of stools available sunday at midday, and the line was only 2 people deep! prices are reasonable for a coffee bar, and they do serve food till 4pm, desserts, and alcohol! no laptops after 7pm, and the music is a bit loud to be listening to lectures, otherwise i will definitely come back when studying!most importantly, their coffee selection is fantastic, and they do have pour overs till 3pm! definitely check this place out! i loved my ipsento latte, a perfect blend of sweet and spicy (it's just a touch of cayenne), well done!great coffee- chill vibe where you're not overwhelmed with picking what coffee/espresso to order- friendly staff who really cares about their coffee craft. enough tables to go around for you to grab you laptop and work while enjoying your coffee.cute little donut treats for $1 each and couple of pastries as well. i tried their pumpkin patch latte (now available)- you can taste the pumpkin come through (no artificial flavors) and no need to add anything else. sweet enough to perfectly balance the pumpkin and latte flavors come through. my boyfriend always orders the western (ice coffee with some orange essence flavor) it's not a quick in and out like a starbucks but you wait for good coffee- patience is key. it's worth the wait!omg please try the ipsento latte. i got mine iced . it's such a magical combination of flavors!! espresso + honey + cayenne + combo of coconut and whole milk. i knew it would be good, but it exceeded expectations. truthfully i can't say say the same for the ipsento mini donut, but it was good as well for only a dollar. i've been wanting to try this place since moving to wicker park as it's right off the 606 and it just looks so cool with the windows open. it's a great spot for relaxing, studying, etc. good spot overall!i really like this cafe. very convenient right off the 606. it was very crowded but service was fast.they served these small donuts that came in six flavors. i tried all six. they had three that we're chocolate glazed. they were pretty small so you won't really be full but delicious.the iced coffee was quite amazing. one of the best i've had in a while. they also have a selection of beer which i will try next time.they had a decent amount of space to get work done and fast wifi.i will probably come here often to work.i stopped here on a recommendation from a friend, although i am not in this neighborhood often. i came in here to buy beans, because i love trying all of the great chicago-based coffee companies. i was having trouble choosing the beans i wanted, and the barista was very helpful in talking me through the different coffees to find something that i would like. i ended up choosing a gift box with the three panama coffees, all of which were absolutely delicious. i love that ipsento tries unique flavors with their coffee. while in the shop, i also purchased a cappuccino and one of the mini donuts! everything tasted great and came out quickly. there were a lot of people in the shop at around 10am on a thursday, so i can imagine this coffee is well-loved by the neighborhood.overall, i am very impressed with the coffee and the service at ipsento. i look forward to returning when i find myself in the area!this is probably one of the best coffee spot i found in chicago. heard very good things but after visiting i am impressed. a cozy place for evening get together or if u just want to relax. ipsento has great coffee latte and great cocktails. we gotnutella latte and mexican nitro coffee (with tequila). #funnightwithfriends #nightoutstopped by this place after another hot chocolate bar was closed for the holidays and i must say wow! we ordered an iced nutella latte, basil mint mocha, hot chocolate, vanilla latte, and a dozen donuts. iced nutella latte - i was very surprised! often these drinks come out too sweet, but this stuck the right balance without being very bitter. basil mint mocha - you can really taste the basil! recommended as a nice warm drink. hot chocolate - rich and creamy, yum!vanilla latte - one of the best lattes i have tasted. donuts - these are so mini! when i was looking at the reviews i didn't realize that the donuts were mini because they are so detailed! we bought a dozen and they came in a cute little box. atmosphere - very warm and comfortable, i could spend a lot of time here!came in here to grab coffee the other day.. cute coffee store, it was crowded with people going in and out. there were people on laptops sitting in there drinking their drinks. i needed coffee and it's a block away from where i am staying. the cashier was friendly and i got my coffee right away. i would come back here for coffee or try one of the other drinks on the menu.i came here with a friend around 1pm on a weekday, and it was quite empty. i got a hibiscus berry cold tea and an ipsento donut. i also had half the hibiscus donut. the tea was quite average but good, and the donut was really small. flavor could have been bolder for sure for the donuts; the frosting on the hibiscus didn't really taste like anything. it was also really expensive; each tiny donut was $1 and the tea was $4. and lots of ice in the cup. they serve the tea in jars though which is nice. i do like the ambience of the place!i love the original ipsento and every location that's come since then, ipsento 606 being no exception. it's coffee, but it's not regular coffee. it seems like everything they do they add a little magical twist to it. i have always been a big fan of their cardamom rose lattes but on my visit here the pumpkin patch latte called to me. it's not at all like going to starbucks so don't worry if you think you're too cool for an sbux psl. this is not that (though i won't hate on those either). their pumpkin patch latte just tastes real. like, real food, real ingredients. there's no question of artificial additives because you can taste how pure this  puppy is. made with real pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and local pumpkin coconut syrup, it is a divine treat on a perfect autumn chicago day.cool cafe coffee shop in bucktown. they're open late. it's by the 606 elevated trail. there's a cool mural outside and a bark. it's quite busy and popular. there's a smaller location close by. while the first location is cozy and small with tables and chairs that don't match, this location is more elegant, and i saw couples having cocktails in the evening. i guess it depends on your personality which location you prefer, this one is open late. i think they make their own donuts. the croissants are from floriole.what a nice lil addition to the neighborhood ! wish they were around when i lived a few blocks away and jogged the 606 a few times a week . solid lattés and iced coffee's . i usually order whatever specialty coffee a coffee shop has so i tried the nutella latté but it was too sweet for my liking and i can do sweet. they have the cutest lil tiny baby dougnuts i usually get for my daughter and i to share. best coffee shop on the 606, in my opinion. grab a cup o joe before your jog , or come lay down in the hill grassy  area next to it in between or after your jog/walk .ordered a mocha from here. it was very creamy and delicious. one of the best mochas i've tasted! the atmosphere is great for working or even just socializing with friends.this is my favorite cafe in chicago. i've been here a few times now (in fact, i make sure to drop by and spend some time here whenever i'm in the wicker park area). i love their laid back yet professional service and the upscale interior. but most of all, i love their creative coffee offerings. the ipsento latte, their signature drink, is just unique. i'm sipping it as i write this, and the hot, spicy flavor perfectly complements the rich latte. oh, for those of you who don't know, the secret is cayenne pepper (just a little bit). they also offer seasonal items like pumpkin latte that's literally real (made with real pumpkin stuff). best class cafe all around, cheers.nitro was really flat, but the decor is nice. (2star) *update: got a good tasty corridor. i forgot who you are but you are the mannn(4 stars)wonderful espresso, and great whole bean offerings. it gets busy on the weekends, so if you're hoping to sit and work, get there early!the evening laptop rule is enforced, and is meant to encourage community among patrons. we enjoyed talking with other customers, and had a great experience! :)great coffee, unique coffee cocktails. i tried their take on an irish coffee; i'm not usually one for the sweeter drinks but it just seemed like the right choice (it was cold and rainy outside - who wouldn't want an irish coffee in that context?!).  it was incredibly rich, so definitely something i'd recommend if you want *just* one drink, or plan on switching to something lighter after, but really good.  i'll have to make my way back over there to try their other stuff.overall, a really chill, accessible, friendly place to grab a coffee or drink and do whatever the heart desires.lured me in, took my money, then was effectively asked to leave.i discovered this place while looking for a cafe that would be open as late as possible, as i had a long night of work ahead of me and needed coffee somewhere that didn't have all the distractions of home. this is a very normal thing, and i see many of us doing it in cafes all the time. this specific location is open until 11 during the week, so it seemed like a perfect spot. upon arrival, i read the various signage on the door. notices about changing hours and the like, and nothing that affected me this evening, so i went inside. for a cafe, this places is extremely loud. most of this is due to the height of the small room coupled with the classic chicago copper top ceiling tiles, but it's definitely exacerbated by the way-too-loud music and the tipsy people yelling over it. this place is far more bar than cafe, though they did appear to be offering a full cafe menu. there were many seats & tables available, as it was a weeknight and after 9pm. i ordered a cardamom rose latte, which ended up being delicious. while waiting for my drink, i set up in a remote dark corner away from most everyone, and opened my laptop. within minutes i was set upon by a staff member who informed me of a "no laptops past 7pm" policy. this seemed bizarre, and i've never experienced this anywhere in my many, many years of working remotely, especially not in a place which calls itself a cafe. i apologized, and let them know i wouldn't have caused this scene had i known, and perhaps a sign on the door would be a good idea, as it would have kept me from even coming inside. the staff member was pleasant and apologetic, and said he himself had suggested the sign, but it was shot down. very odd, as there were (as i had mentioned before) other signs posted on the door. i suspect this is to lure people in and get some money from them before telling them they can't work in there and hope they stay for some more drinks anyway, whereas letting them know up front results in fewer sales. clever racket, but comes eerily close to bait-and-switch. i was, at least, offered the option of a refund or a to-go cup. that seems like very cordial compensation, except the option of "put the laptop away and enjoy your stay here" was very obviously missing. i cannot determine why i was being treated this way. i looked as well-kempt as the rest of the patrons; i was not dressed in some offensive manner. . .they just decided i was not wanted there. i was at least given a coupon for a free drink, which is nice and all, but i'm not sure when i'd ever be back. the only reason i had gone there to begin with was that it claimed to be a late-night cafe; i have many other cafes closer to me that are perfectly fine, and this one has already made it clear i'm not wanted there. after all of this was squared away, i still didn't have my drink. i had to then hang around awkwardly after everyone knew i had been asked to leave. it was terribly embarrassing. it's great that we live in a place where we're allowed to choose the amenities we personally want our businesses to provide, but it becomes problematic when we lure people in with the assumption of amenities, take their money, and then let them know they were wrong. if you want to be a bar, that's great, but call yourself a bar. if you don't want people on their phones or laptops, that's your prerogative, but throw a small sign up, as violet hour does. heck, turn the wifi off after 7, as cafe mustache does (they also have signage). do something. don't just lure people in, take their money and then tell them if they want to be productive they'll have to leave.love, love this place! it is a great addition to bucktown and i love being able to stop by here after a run or walk on the 606. pros: great coffee (recently tried the seasonal basil mint mocha, go try it now if you can), there's wine and beer (!!), the large windows that are opened up to the 606 in the warmer months, and the staff is super friendly.cons: really the biggest con is that there are so many other people that like this place. i always find myself squeezing through crowds and waiting a bit for my coffee. but that's good for business and it's worth it. oh, and seated space is limited but the whole point of me going is to hop back on the 606 with coffee in hand or go explore my wonderful neighborhood some more.loved it! i had first tried ipsento coffee at another cafe in lagrange il that serves ipsento. i had ordered the guatemala huehuetenango pour-over and fell in love. i saw that the coffee shop sold the exact coffee and out of curiosity searched the company only to find out they have a couple locations in chicago!we also had a taste of each of their little donuts and the cinnamon sugar was my favorite! i tried both of their cheese boards which were a yummy and filling snack.we'll be back again as i love that they're open til 11pm. i ended up getting the guatemala coffee (being guatemalan i had to get it and plus i loved it that much).see you soon, ipsento!i started coming to ipsento back in february. i'd come in after an evening of work at a nearby spa, tired and ready to decompress. the friendly staff here is amazingly patient and will discuss any drink on their menu at length to really make sure you get the perfect fit. back then, i opted for the sweater weather - nice and boozy.  served with a square ice cube it has true staying power. now i try to branch out a bit to get to know the menu a little better. i now try to visit ipsento when ever i am in bucktown.dragging myself through o'hare, i knew i needed a good jolt of caffeine before hitting the parking lot known as the chicago highway leading to downtown loop.  i quickly yelped and saw ipsento as a good place and it did not disappoint.  this is a neighbourhood coffee place that has a lot of cozy seating where a lot of quiet groups of people are working.  service is warm and helpful... i was debating between a dirty chai or their seasonal real pumpkin spice coffee drink.  i ended up getting a dirty chai and it was a good one as you can taste a balance of the espresso shot and spices.  it wasn't overly sweet which was a nice relief.  if i'm ever in this spot again, i'll definitely come back to try more of their coffees.  great place and would recommend.i can't believe the amount of times that i have been here and not written a review!! i guess... for the most part a lot of times i was still working at yelp and couldn't leave a review. anyway. i love this place!! from their great coffee, to their excellent tiny donuts! the perfect place to stop off at on your morning walk to grab a drink or small breakfast!ipsento's biggest fault, it's proximity to me.  i have learned a little self control since it's opening but still spend 5x more on coffee than i usually do.  my husband literally just ran down to grab us evening lattes.  this is a clean, modern, and in layman's terms, just really cool coffee shop/bar.  you heard right, bar!  i have popped in a for a few of their cocktails, and, amazing.  i think they rotate both their cocktails and beers but i'm not completely certain.the staff here is always friendly.  they know my name.  at least the morning guys do.  as far as their coffees and lattes go, hands down, the best.  apparently they have this expensive filtration system and use reverse osmosis water.  if anything go for the water and ambiance.came here after dinner on girl's night and really liked the vibe. i felt sorry for the server coz we were a bunch of demanding asian gals who want hot coffee cocktails, but we all liked the drinks so maybe they should think about adding them to the menu for winter! loved the chill vibe but wish there were more comfy chairs and dessert offerings. like that they close late. had a great time and will be back!been to so so so so so many coffee shops and cafés all throughout chicago but i've got to say, ipsento is my favorite. really friendly staff, great coffee, open/comfortable space. for some reason i just always feel like i'm most comfortable and productive here.one of my favorite coffee shops in the city! really great location, directly off the 606 trail. very chill environment. good size shop, with adequate space. i haven't been too creative with my drink orders but do enjoy their iced coffee and toasted everything bagels (very fresh!)the good:the coffee here is tasty.  the ingredients, flavor notes, and presentation is on point.  the not so good:after 3 pm, however, they begin to limit the coffee offering which is a bit inconvenient for late afternoon coffee drinkers.the bad:the service could use a revamp.  we sat counter side for a while and no one came to greet us or remove the previous guest's glasses.  finally, i got up and went in line at the register.  i asked for a menu and the guy behind the counter plopped one at my seat at the counter (and still left the dirty glasses).  finally after being ignored for another 10 minutes, i got up and ordered from the cash register.  i did ask if we normally have to order from the register and the guy said no but since i'm at the register he'll take my order.  none of the employees seemed happy to be there.although the coffee here is good, it is not better than any of a dozen other local coffee shops in the area that serves delicious coffee by baristas with better attitudes.the beautiful esthetics, the wonderful staff and the excellent coffee makes ipsento a must try! one of my favorite coffee spotsvisit at night, grab a drink at the bar, and sit by the open windows for some fantastic wildlife watching!the hip knick-knack store next to ipsento 606 has a card that says, "we used to be cool." that's how i feel when i come to ipsento 606.look -- they serve beer here, too. how cool is that? the windows open up to the lawn outside, where all these young folks hang out and read their bestseller books. how cool is that? you can tie up your dog outside and watch as strangers stop-by to admire your pup. how cool is that? it's basically in the best spot right now in a 3 mile radius -- right off the 606, on damen. doesn't get any cooler than that.but now let me knock it down so i can feel better about myself. it's not a great place to study/work since it's so busy all the time. lots of constant activity. it can get a bit warm due to the windows/wall being open. space can be hard to come by. i sound pretty uncool criticizing this coffeeshop so i'll stop now.i was so excited for this new ipsento location to open up by the 606 bloomingdale trail.  it's off the "leavitt/milwaukee" exit.  once again, it's a beautiful coffee shop with a plenty of natural light.  i ordered one of my favorite speciality coffee drinks, "ipsento."  the iced version of this was wonderful.  it truly was the "make-you-feel-good" beverage i needed for the lazy afternoon.  by the way, their mini homemade donuts are addicting!  please be advised that one (1) serving portion is tiny, like a bite-size miniature donut.  i guess they have done the work of "portion control" and it shouldn't be consumed like potato chips, one after another.  if you can't find a table seating, it's totally alright to stand at the bar.  their current summer hours are great for a night-out in bucktown, open until 11pm.very good coffee drinks and breakfast sandwiches served by unhelpful people who don't smile.amazing coffee, amazing atmosphere, amazing location. whenever i want a great cup of coffee and a chill atmosphere i come here. they also have a beer and cocktail program! the irish coffee is my favorite (probably in the city). only downfall is the cocktails aren't served until 4pm. just go here and hangout.amazing new location! bright and welcoming, and with a perfect spot off the 606, i can see this being a very popular place! amazing donuts and speedy quality coffee brews to boot! (normally i'd write more but honestly this place is just a spot that speaks for itself!)can't get enough of this cafe bar! nutella latte: 5basil mint mocha (with anise): 5guatemala roast (pour-over): 5brazil roast (pour-over): 4great high top seating with ample desk space for getting work done, or gathering with a group.i like ipsento a lot - both locations really take coffee seriously and deliver wonderful and creative coffee drinks and pastries. that being said, i'm a little disappointed with their 606 shop. the aesthetic of the place is fresh and trendy, but the set up really isn't comfortable for sticking around very long. there's not quite enough seating and/or workspace for how many people go through there and what is there, isn't set up very well for meeting up with friends or working. but, great coffee.oh and yummy mini donuts - definitely try the donuts!i went to this coffee shop last weekend when i asked a couple of my work friends where to explore in wicker park. i checked out the yelp reviews before going and my friends were right! i got their lattee with cayenne in - so so good!! i ended up staying for three hours to enjoy my coffee and people watch outside their large window. great place, super cool employees and amazing coffee.i really like the cafe and the layout. it is not too loud (but also not quiet enough where i would feel awkward to socialize)  and lot of space to work. i chose the spot that could see into the park and it was nice to be able to enjoy he outdoor even though i had to do work. i ordered a latte and it was delicious. i saw there were some donuts that looked really cute (but i could probably inhale them in a second). i didn't try it since he flavor i wanted was out, but it's on my listvery friendly, knowledgeable staff, urban feel, great natural sunlight and most importantly delicious coffee. came here on a coffee tour with a few friends and split the panama flight, which was recommended by one of the employees. aeropress - smooth, a little woody, balanced, flavors linger on your tongue for a while after finishing your drink. single origin espresso - complex, interesting, faint notes of honey. nitro cold brew - dark, smooth, easy drinkability, not carbonated/artificial tasting like a lot of cold brews. will definitely be back!coffee shop is unfriendly to laptop users after 7 pm on weekday nights. no laptop rule. expensive coffeeshop. dirty countertops.a true coffee bar.  i visited on a tuesday night around 8pm on my self-guided blue line coffee tour.  at night the coffee menu is limited because they focus on alcohol sales, but its still a good time to get a cortado.  and man, is it good!  and unique!  the only cortado i have drank that is made with 3 (yes, 3!!) shots of espresso.  beware, you may not sleep for a while after a cortado from this place.  then ambiance at night is classy and calming with the dimmed lights and candle lit room.  the layout of the coffee bar focuses my attention on the main reason i visited here: the back-to-back slayer espresso machines--they are beautiful!  the baristas/bartenders are super friendly--chat with them!--and down to earth.nice atmosphere with polite staff. the coffee we had the nutella and coconut almond milk latte and the basil mint latta. both were great. had their mini house made donuts ($1 each ) but they were good. nice place to warm up and enjoy local coffee.very cool, very clean, very hipster, and very busy. ipsento 606 was definitely a good spot to come to on this hot saturday morning, and the mural on the outside wall is a sight to see also. i got a nitro cold brew on this hot day, but it was pretty tiny disappointingly. the coffee was good, but i think i like starbuck's cold brew better....people will hate me for saying that..... needless to say, the girl at the counter was super friendly and perky, and the overall coffee shop vibe and atmosphere was great. they have a variety of great menu options, and one that i got to try was the western. it was a little too sweet though, but if you're into that, it is very refreshing. i would recommend this cool spot if you're looking for a unique spot outside the local starbucks.i really enjoy the decor and setting of this ipsento.  it's usually pretty crowded so it is hard to find seating.  i think their menu selections are unique and comprehensive.  i ordered a hibiscus iced tea and they gave me a black tea instead, which is why i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars and the iced tea was kind of plain and not exciting for a nice coffee shop.  i will stick to lattes here.what more is there to say?  the best coffee shop in chicago.  i love their guatemala beans... so far it's my favorite coffee i've had.love this coffee place, right off the 606 path.  it's a hip/trendy spot that always seems to be busy -- even at 2pm on a saturday. they have a great coffee drink selection, as well as donuts, pastries, and alcohol for later in the day.  i just tried their seasonal pumpkin patch latte. i'm not a big starbucks psl drinker, but ipsento's pumpkin latte ingredients are top notch.  the girl ringing up my order was extremely knowledgeable about their menu and super friendly. all around, great atmosphere.  can't wait to come back here for a weekend coffee or glass of wine soon!this is my favorite coffee shop in chicago, hands down. the honey, spices, coconut milk, and overall quality is sublime. it can be pricey, but it's worth it -- what a treat! stick to coffee, though. the food is good, but it doesn't hold a candle to the espresso bar.service is great here and the coffee is awesome. note that this spot becomes a bar scene around 6ish in the evening so it's not a great idea if you're trying to study/get work done. during the day though it's an awesome study spot with a gorgeous view of a park and the 606.the best coffee in chicago. there are many coffee shops out there and so many nicer than this location but the flavor of this place was just perfect for my palate.  the place is great with a nice view and it has a great ambience.  the service is decent.place in amazing. device and style of the locals and the unique coffee.  get the ipsento latte. it's amazing.honestly, this is the best coffee in chicago. better than sawada, better than intelligentsia, better than dark matter and all the other blah blah blahs. i actually rave about their lattes to my friends. (is that sad?) no joke, i can't order lattes from any other place because every other latte is just sh*t. seriously. total sh*t. every time i order a latte, it's perfect temperature, perfect taste -- not bitter, not syrupy, just perfect. honestly, *every* time. the only place i like more is philz in san francisco, so for now, yeah, ipsento has secured all my future business :)i visited ipsento 606 recently with family who were visiting the city all the way from pennsylvania. it was also my first visit to ipsento 606, having lived in the city over a year now. the coffee/cocktail i ordered wasn't a flavor i was very fond of (think essence of black licorice), but i tried a different option that one of my older sisters likes, and preferred that coffee/cocktail to the one i ordered. that being said, both drinks were made well; it was just a taste preference for me, no wrongdoing on ipsento's part. everyone in my group enjoyed the ambiance and fun conversations we shared at our table. our apologies if we were the more animated group that night! anyway, the main reason for the five stars is that my sister showed me the where they keep their adorable, mini donut collection. i was debating which flavors to take home to my girlfriend (would she like these? oh, come on. who wouldn't?), and after we confirmed that we also wanted to order some drinks, the gentleman who was behind the donut display gave us a variety of donuts to try on the house! it was such an unexpected and generous gesture that has left me with a wonderful impression of ipsento 606, the sprinkle on the donut, if you will.a big "thank you" for making my family and me have even more reasons to smile that night with the two free plates of delicious, wee donuts and chill, candle-lit atmosphere. side note: my aunt is a flautist, so it was great and coincidental that a lot of the music playing while we were all there featured the flute. it's like you knew!beautiful coffee shop. love their nutella latte. pretty large space. i was able to park right across the street on a saturday morning.this is a great spot to get coffee, a drink, or have an informal meeting. right by the 606 and it's super pretty inside!i want to start off by saying i really enjoy ipsento. i think they have coffee and a great staff and have gone in numerous times for coffee dates, to sit and get work done, and i enjoy myself whenever i'm there, thus the four stars. however, i went in last night at 9:45 hoping to get a small snack and maybe a tea. despite the fact that their kitchen is open until 10, they had already shut down. my friend asked for a different dish, they had also put that away, too. i was hungry, i wanted to sit and chat with a snack and a friend, and finally check out ipsento 606 at night time. i was just really, really disappointed. if your kitchen is open until 10, i should be able to get a bite until 10. what also bothered me is that the man who helped us, while nice, wasn't very apologetic and didn't have any other suggestions for us. i still love this place, i will still get coffee from here, but i probably won't come here at night. the hospitality was a much different experience from the day.i'm giving ipsento 606 5 stars for the rose cardamom latte.  i had never heard such a latte existed until my friend tipped me.  wow!  it was beautiful.  and the place itself is pretty neat.  i'll be back to check out more drinks!this is a great café to spend the day working, if you're lucky enough to get a seat close enough to an outlet. the drinks are high quality and the space is tops, which is why it's always so busy. sharing the tables is typical, so just expect to befriend a stranger if you're looking to settle down with your computer. every experience i've had at ipsento 606 has been enjoyable, and i've always been quite satisfied with my drink quality - which is typically single origin pour-over or espresso. it's nice to have the switch to a cocktail bar in the evenings with equally fantastic beverages. just keep in mind that they dim the lights at that time, so study time is over if you're working with paper!i absolutely love this place i mean i can't get enough of it. i'm not sure if it's the awesome location with the cool rock seating and mural painting outback, the coffee snob ambiance, or the amazing drinks that keeps me coming back. each time i come i always get the nutella latte with almond milk, it's amazing if you haven't tried it please do....you won't be disappointed. after hours it turns into sort of a lounge/bar/coffee house you can order hand crafted cocktails and beer. i must mention the disclaimer i noticed this last time i was here: after 7pm no laptops are allowed. i guess they don't want your books & laptop taking up counter space while patrons are trying to drink and mingle. however the other location does not have this rule. so i guess this location is your more upscale coffee house/bar lounge and the other is your laid back coffee house. so whatever your mood i'm sure you can get whatever your looking for at either location.seriously?!  are you kidding me?!?  the no laptop policy after 7pm is lame!  i went out of my way to come to ipsento to work on my mac, have a drink, and chill.  was so disappointed to hear that was not possible as it was after 7pm.  interestingly, others were using their laptops and nothing was said to them.  ipsento i was so excited to find you.  i'll take my business elsewhere.i went last night to get some work/applications done, enjoy a tea and catch debate highlights on my laptop. it is official: i love this place. it is super open, has a fun open vibe, food and alcho beverages are optional but many of the people were just like me, slowly sipping caffeine on their laptop. i ordered a jasmine green tea, which was brought out to me on a beautiful display! it seeped for 3 minutes and was delicious.the best part is that instead of walking back the way i got there, taking the bus or uber (i walk everywhere, unless it's more than a mile or two) i walked the 606 the entire way home! hence, ipsento 606  it was awesome, well lit and felt very safe. it was 1.1 mile and went by in a flash.all the cafes in my hood (logan square, near the 606) close by 7, and ipsento is open until 11. hooray, i found my new go-to evening spot.my favorite coffee shop and bar in all of chicago. the atmosphere is perfect for a client meeting, hanging with friends, or going on a date. the drinks are all incredible and reasonably priced. the staff is informative and fun! what more could you want?during my trip to chicago this year i set out to try as many local coffee shops around as i could. ipsento 606 was introduced to me at the local wicker park farmers market. they had a classy cart serving delicious nitro coffee. i've become a fan of the new nitro coffee trend and truly enjoy the foamy, smooth and light variation of classic coffees. ipsento 606 hit it spot on with the coffee being very smooth and rich, where you could really tell the flavor of the coffee and how meticulously the bean was extracted. i decided to the go to the shop the next day to try out some more of the nitro coffee, i was not disappointed. after walking in, my eye caught the astounding baristas crafting away - almost like an art and their beautiful machines behind the counter. i would assume they have a special training method as i also got too witness a barista teaching (what looked like) a new employee the drip method. it was good to know that the baristas were immensely trained. back to the coffee, you could taste the richness and natural bitterness of the dark roast. there wasn't too much foam on top and the nitrogen infusion was done correctly. probably the best nitrogen coffee i've had to date.cute place to go for coffee or to get work done. most of the chairs are backless, though, and it does get pretty busy. the lighting toward the evening is more geared toward the bar feel so don't plan to stay late to do work unless you enjoy working with minimal light. the staff here are very kind, and i would definitely recommend checking this place out!so i'm old and remember a chicago where a small coffee and a tea didn't set you back $7.00. and if i want micro-donuts, i'll go to dunkin donuts where they're called munchkins at a price of 10 for $2.50 vs. the $1 per they'll cost a person at ipsento 606. i suppose that has old man written all over it.that said, ipsento's beautiful as it looks out onto the trail. the service was excellent and attentive. my simple black coffee was in fact delicious. and it was packed with the young go-getters on laptops doing the instafacesnaptweet who tend to populate such a spot, so they must be doing something right. not a table available, so we took our beverages and hung out in the park adjoining the 606. it's a glorious spot to be sure.there wasn't much here before the 606 turned this stretch of milwaukee into the hip hangout spot of the future, so i give ipsento much praise for taking a chance.the cardamom rose latte was smoother than a baby's bottom!! the music was soulful, the decor was on point, and in the summer they open the side windows to a nice grassy view of the 606. only change is i wish they had seats with backs instead of stools. my back's not what it used to be...this is a definitely a premiere stop on the 606 trail! whether you're starting off or getting ready for a walk, ipsento 606 is the great way to start or end your activities. the interior is very contemporary with minimalist designs, so it was very appealing for my style :)my girlfriend and i ordered a latte and a nitro coffee. the barista was very helpful in describing the flavor notes and questions i had with the nitro. the latte was pulled very well, but my favorite was the nitro! it was very eye-appealing with a small "head" and was delivered in a well-designed glass cup. it was very smooth with less acidity than a traditional brew with lingering chocolate notes.. if you're into describing coffee. in general, an excellent stop for coffee and i plan on returning multiple times when i'm in the area!ipsento has done it again! wow the new set up is completely different from its old one. the ipsento 606 is very modern, clean, and efficient. it has a nice, dark, work vibes feel to it. i can definitely see myself perched here for hours. and guess what, you can be because they are open until midnight! now that is amazing for a night owl like me. as always, i get the ...// ipsento - extra sassy - this honey coconut cayenne latte is out of this world. the extra sassy part means more cayenne.. because i... like... it... hot! one of the most delicious unique drinks in chicago.ample seating, great location, huge windows and friendly staff. doesn't get much better than this. can't wait till it cools down a bit and they can open up the windows on the side.pass this all the time on the 606 and it always seems busy.  actually decided to go in this past weekend for some hot chocolate and was of course tempted by the little donuts.  there was about a 10 minute wait for our drinks, they were good not too sweet a nice bitter hot chocolate.  the donuts were not worth it- kind of hard and dry.  the overall feel is pretentious- i feel like people go here to be seen over actually getting good work done.  there was no place to sit when we were there at 3pm on a sunday afternoon.this is the second location of ipsento (yay!) and within walking distance of their original location.  although the space is gorgeous it felt a little empty and lacked the warmth of the original ipsento in bucktown.  the staff of course was incredibly helpful and friendly which seems to be a requirement to be an ipsento employee.  i had my usual nutella latte and the drink was just as delicious as from the other location.   this location also serves beer and wine in the evenings in addition to  mini donuts (which i didn't try but they did look adorable).best coffee shop in chicago. training of baristas is intense and important to their ability to deliver consistently amazing coffee.  here at least once a day since it opened and for years at the prior location - haven't ever been disappointed. super friendly and amazing environment - right on the 606. the original is also amazing but this is closer to home. try the ipsento (i get less spice) or the london fog for something different.  service is very fast because they have two awesome machines.two, two, two concepts in one! it's a cafe, its a bar. it has an upscale, spa like feel with lots of light and high ceilings by day and cozier, turn down by evening. i was bowled over by the expansive cocktail menu. hot chocolate with bourbon...this place suffers from an identity crisis. it's an amazing coffeeshop/bar to chill at, but then, once 6pm rolls around, it attempts to force a bar atmosphere on its patrons via obnoxiously loud music. i get that it's trying to fill multiple niches, but it isn't doing the best job of actually responding to what its consumers actually want. you look around after 6pm and people are still attempting to work, study, lounge on tech or with a friend...they are most assuredly not crowding the bar, drink in hand soaking up the bar scene. basically...before 6pm - 5 starsafter 6pm - 2 starsipsento 606 is a really great new coffee shop located right off the 606--with the open spaces, light, and green accents fitting to that location. i had a rich flavorful coffee, and was beyond pleased to discover they also carry a gluten free buckwheat scone (disclosure: made on shared equipment).everything from the location to the staff was warm and welcoming, and it was a lovely stop in during my wanderings. i definitely recommend!cute space, right off the 606. got the chai tea latte, which is always tasty. consistent coffee with the original location.music in here is a little loud and except for one booth by the window the chairs here are backless- but other than that the ambiance is perfect. their rose cardamom latte was on point and you can also get these amazing potato based donuts. good spot to work, lots of light and table space. definitely coming back!i love ipsento coffee. i always make sure to visit and sit down for a cup when visiting chicago. i recommend the place to all my friends that come to visit chicago. some of the best and unique coffee i've had so far.love the new location!! welcome to the neighborhood 606 ipsento! same amazing coffee a couple blocks closer to my condo. nice open layout next to the 606 trail and park. mini donuts were great to take next door and eat outside.they have beer on tap also though i haven't come in the evening yet.this ipsento has much more room and the notoriously long waits were better here too :)absolutely amazing. incredible unique blend of coffee, beer, and donuts!  i'm ready to spend an entire day here and try one of everything on the menu. to top it off, the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable.two words: nutella latte. great flavor and great atmosphere.great location next to a 606 entryway and high-quality beer and coffee with delicious mini donuts.i'm obsessed with this place. i live in the burbs and track the daily traffic on the kennedy to see when it will only take me 33 min to get my ipsento fix. any time i'm in the city, i try to stop by here on my way home. i love the ipsento and the cardamom rose! they are the best coffee drinks i've ever had in chicago!!!! i also love the staff and the place itself. i'm always so jealous of the patrons i see working at the tables. i wish i lived closer so that i could be a true regular!love ipsento.  it's hands down the best coffee in the city.  this location is fantastic - super convenient next to the 606, and the interior is so modern and clean and much larger than the western location.  i haven't tried any of the food so can't speak to it but i'd be surprised if they did anything here that isn't amazing.whatever you do, don't waste your money on their tiny expensive donuts.  biggest rip off ever.  other than that, and ipsentos typically slow service (although not as slow as the western shop), i have no complaints.  it's a beautiful coffee shop, with good coffee, and great location if you want to hit the 606.  i like getting my coffee to go and sitting in the park next door.try the blueberry lemon smoothie! coffee, donuts and atmosphere are all very good as well. this will definitely be my new go to place for coffee in the neighborhood.awesome new spot down right off the leavitt/milwaukee exit from the 606. great extension of the original coffee shop. it's definitely a unique spot to grab a drink on a friday night. service was great, i wasn't feeling any alcohol so i just asked for a recommendation without it and the bartender suggested an awesome nitro coffee, comparable to the original nitro at the western coffee shop (i got it)my girlfriend was a little hungover so we just asked for something without caffeine or alcohol and the bartender nailed that suggestion too with a veggie drink that was amazing.awesome impromptu stop at this slightly hidden spot.p.s. try the mini donuts, they are delicious. their food menu in general isthe best coffee space in the whole city, by a long shot. one of the loveliest places to enjoy a coffee or drink, especially in the summer when their windows open up into the park next door. with a comprehensive drink menu in the evening and a delicious, thoughtful and well sourced coffee menu during the day, this place is essential. you need to go here. the whole staff is so friendly also - bonus!my favorite coffee shop. i come here all the time to work, read, and just chill out. the lattes are amazing. the pumpkin patch tastes just like pumpkin pie. they have a wide variety of options for coffee and tea lovers, as well as ways to customize. they also have beer, wine and cocktails. if you feel like having a drink it's a nice spot to hang out and not be in a bar setting. love when the weather is nice and the windows are all open! definitely recommend coming here.perfect macchiato, delicious little donuts and a delightful almond croissant (yes, i did! ). all packaged in a space with tall ceilings and filled with hip and beautiful students, consultants and artists who don't go into an office during the week.  and, helpful,friendly staff.great coffee, and a nice (albeit short) list of craft beers, but no a/c. i repeat: no a/c. in summer. it's literally cooler standing in the sun outside than inside ipsento. no fans circulating air. no reliable breeze passing through. just hot air. lots of it.never have i ever loved a latte more than i love the ipsento latte. i'm here pretty frequently and it's a great place to get some work done with a chill vibe. the staff here is so friendly as well. it's really everything that you want in a coffee shop. i live right off the 606 and it's the best detour one could make during a morning walk.this place is pretty dope. the interior alone is stunning, with dark wood furniture, marble countertops, bronzed high ceilings, and an open kitchen. coffee here is great! have yet to be let down. they take their coffee making business very seriously; their espresso setup is pretty sweet. the staff is very kind, helpful, and the drinks are on point. they also have two huge window that opens up on the side to a small park- a great touch, especially for summer nights. for the colder months, their seasonal drinks are great!if you want high quality coffee with a fantastic ambiance, look no further. the coffee is great, but the space is amazing. it's open, spacious and they have a huge window/opening that looks out onto a grassy area and the 606 trail. it's the perfect place to catch up with friends, and i love that it's so close to the trail. the people who work here really know their stuff, and i've had nothing but great service.both ipsento locations are excellent first and foremost. ipsento 606's location is excellent for ambiance and get together and caters to everyone. just steps away from the 606 trail makes it easy to take a break at ipsento or take your drink to go. open later is always a plus as well.great coffee. great beer/drink selection. expensive but worth t when ya need it. great proximity to park!! like really really close to a a really really great park with a great mural. can never manage to get a table and usually never get a seat. saw a wedding party here once and everyone looked wonderful.thanks to their no-drip-coffee-after-4pm policy, i couldn't but try an iced coffee, instead. this is the best iced coffee to me. i have enjoyed cold brew coffee, but accepted that fresh coffee aroma i love from pourover drip must be sacrificed in cold brew. however, ipsento's iced coffee was quite different. it was full of very fresh coffee aroma, but it also had a note of cold brew although i don't believe it is cold brew. i filled my tumbler with it on the way to the 606 trail, and refilled it and filled another tumbler on the way back home. i wish i could visit more often, but it is quite far from the north area. still thank them for opening this new location as it is still more convenient (in terms of parking and nearby traffic) to visit than their original store.+ i tasted my wife's iced mocha with almond milk. it was so-so. i don't recommend it.attentive gentlemen behind the bar, romantic, warm, and comfortable mood lighting, and wonderfully made coffeethank you for a beautiful eveningthe latte i received from this place was probably the best this side of the pond. i described the drink as smooth to my friends. the latte was too the brim and never spilled. my group was in awe of how full the cup was but never spilled. i enjoyed every sip and will be going back whenever i'm in the area.ipsento coffee is amazing & leaves the perfect spiced taste in your mouth- i also recently had a basil mint mocha which was a luxurious andes mint tasting special they had! downside: not a huge place so seating isn't always available- i have heard great things about their donuts but they don't make them at night & every time i have been in the am they aren't making them that day it seems :( hopefully i will be able to get them sooner than later !i'm a sucker for coffee shops and ipsento 606 sits at the top of the list. i love that design of the interior and how open and bright it is. it's a great place to work during the week. it can get loud/busy on the weekends, but i like working in that kind of environment. i love that it's right by the 606, easy to get to, and easy to find parking. i've had the iced coffee and iced chai, both are really good. they have these tiny mini donuts that are perfect for snacking on. for those of you that appreciate quality coffee, this is the spot for you. splurging a little goes a long way when it comes to coffee.ipsento 606 coffee isn't the best, it's nothing amazing but this location is awesome! it's right next to the 606 pathwalk, nothing like enjoying an ice brewed coffee while taking a walk.i'm not sure if i'm going to the same place as all these other reviews....i used to go to the western ave ipsento when i lived near it. now that i've moved, i walk to this one when on the 606. two of the times i have been in, they have lost my order. i stand there until i finally have to say something to get my order. it's been pretty disappointing. i am a huge fan of their coffee. but each time i've gone, the line has been frustratingly long (only one check out open but several people wandering around) and then to have lost orders - doesn't seem efficient to me.i don't mind waiting for good coffee, but maybe figure out a better system for orders rather than pieces of paper that fly off counters, only to be lost.the people are always friendly, for sure. wish there weren't so many strollers inside - hard to navigate to the counter and pick up area.will continue to go but will watch to be sure my order is on the move.it's really atmospheric european place. cozy and super  clean (sparkling clean). smells like coffee beans. the staff were courteous and accommodating ... i ordered ipsento latte and it was way too sweet for me (lots of honey), i asked to change it for regular latte, and they were okay to do that. very friendly! can't tell that coffee was really good, but i'll stop by for drinks next time.5 stars just for the service, even with a mishap.  atmosphere:  hella chill.drink:  ultimate comfort food, my fave is their milk steamers with unique flavored syrups added (good alternative when you've od'd on hot chocolate at katherine anne's but still want a cozy kind of drink).  this is no starbucks wannabe.  if you're not a steamer or coffee person they have great tea options too.  not sure about the location on california but the one on milwaukee has cocktails and such too.service:the last time i was at their other location i had gotten hooked on their jo snow cardamom rose syrup mixed into my milk steamer.  so effen good.  tonight when we walked into this location i couldn't remember the flavor's name, so i'm trying to explain to the nice barista i wanted a thing, but no idea what was in the thing, but the other place put that thing in my steamer and it was delicious.  yeah.  if it sounds stupid to you, it was definitely awkward for me.  but in about 2 seconds flat the first barista was like, "oh the cardamom rose!"  (4 for you glen coco!)a slight mixup meant i ended up with a latte at first instead of a steamer (complete with a pretty leaf in the foam).  the 2nd barista quickly and professionally resolved it, including refunding the difference in my change.  he even offered the oopsie latte to my husband which i think was a great way to show good will.i've had order mixups elsewhere (who hasn't?) and it's usually a cringe-worthy exchange where i feel like i need to talk to 15 people just to clarify what happened, sometimes with an accusatory manager in my face like i'm a scammer.  the staff at ipsento 606 made it smooth and after a long day, i really appreciated that friendly aspect.  i'll be back!love this place! quality coffee, yummy pastries and friendly staff. my first time in the barista recommended a drink for me... so good! i wish i could remember her name because she was so sweet and really took care of us. this is the perfect place to go if you're looking for a coffee shop with a chill vibe and cute atmosphere. i probably wouldn't recommend this place if you're in a rush or just plan on taking a little extra time for your coffee run, from all my experiences so far it's not an in and out kind of place... it does takes a little longer to get everything made for you but it's worth it. make sure you try their mini vegan donuts! they're adorable and so delicious!i've been to this ipsento a couple of times and it's such a great space. the shop is modern and inviting, and i love sitting at the counter in the back window and watching the dogs play in the park. the first time i came i tried the nitro iced coffee, which was really good. i didn't love it purely because i don't love nitro coffee, which i've learned now. but i still really enjoyed it. i recently came in early on a sunday (which was great, so empty) and had a cappuccino. it was delicious and well balanced. a note with the cappuccinos though--they have a couple of sizes, so i had to ask the differences. the small and medium have 2 shots, i went with the medium because i wanted a bigger drink. but the medium is definitely a bit more like a latte due to the fact that it has more milk. it's still great, but if you want a more traditional cappuccino, go with the small. i also had a croissant, which was really good, not the best ever, but really tasty. they have a pretty extensive menu so i hope to come back soon to try one of their specialty lattes.i literally love this place!!!!!!!! i discovered ipsento many years ago when it only had one location, and it gets better every time i go. you can tell that the owner really puts their heart and soul into this place. the coffee is amazing, outstanding, affordable, and grown sustainably! ive spoken with the owner, who has personally visited these coffee farms himself, hundreds and hundreds of miles away, to make sure the farming families have good living conditions. now that is dedication. you can taste the effort put into their drinks from the ground up, literally. the ambiance is great, as well as its location. i know their old location had sandwiches, which were to die for! i don't think the new location serves them though. i love going here for just about anything, whether it be to escape my home routine, to work, to relax, or to catch up with friends. the thing i love most about this place is that i know my money is going toward something good. its in good hands, and well worth supporting over some place like starbucks any day. please go! you'll thank me.they went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. when you watch them make drinks here you can tell that they really care about what they are making. it's almost like watching an artist.the place is cool. chill vibe. and it's ipsento beans which i really love. i got a basil mint mocha it's so extremely faint so i taste mainly mocha.the donuts were really interesting though. tried the lemon one and another. both good. however don't expect the same exact texture of a regular donut. i understood it was sweet potato based so very different. love the lemoni really really like this place. the open windows, natural lightning, and trendy decor make this place one of the must visit coffee shops in chicago! my fiancée and i were staying with a friend in wicker park and walked on the 606 to ipsento. the scenery is beautiful and the coffee hit the spot. the employees were also very nice and courteous. they also have this trash can that leads to a long tunnel underground which blew my mind (where does this trash go??).i look forward to visiting again in december!good place to pick up coffee before walking the 606. it's also fun to people watch since it seems to draw a great mix of people and dogs! i think if you're from the neighborhood it's a nice hangout.love their iced ipsento and guilt-free mini donuts! a store with nice modern interior and plenty of tables and seats. it just a lot of ppl would come so the seats won't be available during busy hours even though the store put out many. a small park is in front which can be your place to enjoy the sunlight with a nice cup of tea. i wish people are a little more friendly though :)there is also a nice trail i found on my last visit so i recommend you to walk after your visit to ipsento 606.as always, ipsento doesn't fail to impress. i loved the atmosphere of this place--it was spacious, clean and modern with a fair amount of seating and outlets for working. the coffee was very good, as to be expected, and i liked how the layout allowed you to watch the baristas make your drink. will definitely be back again!ipsento has amazing coffee, hands down.  this is a craft coffee shop during the day and a classy craft cocktail, alcohol bar at night.  the atmosphere is really classy and a great quiet date spot at night time. the transition from coffee shop to bar happens around 6pm and is pretty seamless.  the staff is very knowledgeable and dedicated to the coffee craft. the space is so unique being right off the 606. they have wide garage doors that open during the summer, making you feel like you're sitting right in a park off the 606.  completely recommend it!i can't think of a better treat than an ipsento latte. you just worked out? treat yo self to an ipsento latte! you had a bad day? treat yo self! you had a good day? treat yo self! you managed to walk/run/ride on the 606 without an accident? treat yo self!just like the other ipsento, except this one is in an instagram-worthy setting. so happy to finally have a cafe at the milwaukee/leavitt 606 entrance. the space is large, open, and airy. when they were working on the space, i thought maybe the side openings would be a walk up window for those of us with dogs, but alas, they are just 2 very large windows with bar height seating. staff was friendly and although not everything was yet available off the menu, they still made me a killer iced chai!i come here for the following reasons, in this order:- irish coffee - it's like drinking jeff bridges sleep tapes - the crafted interior - ambience. i'd read and drink so hard...- is that internet radio i hear? yes... and it better stay that way.then finish with a crafted cocktail - loved, not shaken (unless necessary).great space and is serving the classic ipsento coffee favorites (cardamom rose latte... the ipsento) from the original down the street, but this location is the new, cool, hip, older cousin, from out of town who has a australian accent comparatively speaking. sleek modern decor and a warm vibe offer enriched menus to include spirits and boozes, foods, and tiny doughnuts. overlooks the 606 at milwaukee and when it is nice, windows open in front of some primo laptop hacking spots.first off, i admit that i am a coffee snob. i start my day with a cup of my favorite costa rican coffee plantation coffee (peaberry, expresso, french roast) which ships directly to my house. i am very critical of coffee shops. this place was highly recommenced to me. i admit, i went there without high expectations. the place definitely has a cool and smart vibe. most walk in with either a large text book or a computer. i walked in with neither, just my low expectations. the room is large and cleanly decorated. the staff is friendly and working feverishly like bees. the basil mint coffee was recommended to me. what basil?? in my coffee!! okay, calm down, keep an open mind. i waited a few minutes after ordering, then took my coffee to go check out the 606 route which i have heard soo much about. i'm checking out the very cool fairly new pathway as i took my first sip. damn that's good!! the coffee used was pretty good, which i believe they roast in house. but what stood out to me was the milk used, besides the basil flavor. it tasted as if it came straight from the cow's utter. it was super creamy and rich. the basil and mint flavors made me feel as if i was eating a fine italian meal with very good coffee. the combined flavors worked beautifully.if you want to find a place that's offering the latest friend in nitro coffee this is a good place to go. even walking up to it you get excited seeing a beautiful mural on the wall next to a cute park. inside is clean and modern and there are stools to look out into the park it feels like a spacious place not in the city. the copy was delicious and toasty. try the nutella latte .. i got mine with have two pumps and it was perfect. the staff were all friendly and nice. this is definitely going to become my regular coffee place.this is by far my favorite place. although it isn't home tony favorite latte or cortado, it's coffee is amongst my favorite. the shop is exquisite, the baristas are pro's, the equipment is second to none, they even have a mod bar hanging around. the look and feel is beautiful, the location is right on. it's a coffee lovers candy store. if you're into coffee, you must come here. this is a must stop on the chicago coffee seen.would be five stars but where's the food menu?! they have such a wonderful one at their other location!! is more food coming for this location? everything else = wonderful! i just like to come and work all day, including get lunch. stinks when i can't orders anything except a mini donut or a tomato salad :(coffee house cocktails at night?! how cool. relaxing way for a night cap drink or coffee (average $3-10). friendly staff, industrial/open space, fun drinks. usually drink coffee black but ipsento latte was surprisingly satisfying/delicious.the actual shop does not really stand out and is attached to apartments so keep your eyes peeled.this place just turned 1 years old and is absolutely flourishing.  great people behind the bar, cozy and modern atmosphere, is really in love with the energy this bar is harvesting.  when the sponsor food, it's delicious.  when they make you a drink, it's phenomenal.what a great cafe! we tried some of the nitro coffees with liqueurs. amazing. especially the sardinian. finished with the "corpse reviver #2", which is only 6 bucks during happy hour 5-7. refreshing and packed full of citrus flavors, but def not too sweet. baristas were very friendly, laid back, and helpful.this is by far one the best chicago coffee shops. if you're a traveler and coffee lover, this is a must try.perfect coffee, small tasty pastry selection, and love the modern decor. fyi, they take their time making their superb coffeei love it here. the coffee is fantastic, the caneles will blow your kind and the atmosphere is great. however, they have got to work on their efficiencies for the ordering process. when it gets busy, the line will easily  stretch 25 people long through the entire store. even when there were only 5 people in line in front of me it took 10 minutes just to order. i understand and appreciate that this is not a starbucks, however it is frustrating for customers. strive for improvement in this area :)i fell in love with the original locations lattes and was so excited when they opened another off the 606. their nutella, ipsento, and chai lattes are probably the best i've ever had! location is perfect and there's a small park where you can sit outside afterwards on a nice day. their coffee itself is just okay. sometimes good, sometimes not. i think they change up the type the brew but i never see it posted anywhere. their lattes are a must, for coffee there's better places. have not gone their at night but i know this location stays open later as a bar.go now before bucktown babystrollers come rolling down the 606 ramp and form a queue up and down milwaukee. inevitability.surprisingly not that busy at the time of this writing during their soft launch.  not much they can do to improve (the sampled coffee-laced beer was delish), but it will get over-run, so my hope is that the original location i've been making pilgrimages to (from far north logan sq. - nice 4.5 mile round trip walk in the winter) will have some of its traffic offloaded to this new space. best coffee in the city. if you feel otherwise, you're wrong.had to try this place after reading all the reviews so it was good but as some of the other reviews say... over priced for a coffee, latte etc.this new location is beautiful, clean, and resembles many third wave coffee shops in san francisco / the bay area. i tried the nicaragua pour over which was a very balanced, clean cup and i throughly enjoyed it.tim was very knowledgable, helpful, and articulate when describing the various ipsento offerings. i wish i was staying in chicago longer! thanks ipsento and tim, i'll be sure to stop by the next time i am in town.the nutella latte was good, not too sweet which i prefer. but my favorite is the ipsento latte. all the ingredients come together perfectly and most importantly, it was not too sweet. i tried the chai latte as well but unfortunately it was too sweet for my taste. also, it was a nice place to set up and do work.love this spot! it's quiet and the quality is up there. the presentation of my tea was clean and professional. this place pays attention to the little things - the details that add to the experience of simply drinking a warm and sometimes caffeinated beverage.so this place has everything.  literally everything.clean comfortable atmosphere?  check.delicious coffee?  check.plentiful outlets?  check.tasty snacks?  check.good wine?  check.wifi? check.easy to get to?  check.big open windows to enjoy summer days?  check.cool cocktails?  check.beer?  check.friendly service?  check check.this is the only place in chicago where i can come during the day for an amazing latte and at night for drink with friends (or with a book if i'm alone) at the bar.very pretty cafe and setting, even if atmosphere reminds me of the band, the tragically hip.   flavorful espresso and classic espresso drinks, and attention to detail with them.  but there's a lot of super-sized flavored latte catering to usa generation douche types who think a trip to california makes them worldly. a few folks there are more up-tight than their skinny jeans.this is what a neighborhood hangout should be. coffee to get going, snazzy cocktails to relax, and a chill atmosphere with friendly drink-makers. seating for around 15 at the bar and about the same at the tables. the coffees are every bit as good as the original ipsento location. too bad there's no food, but that's a small price to, well, not pay.i got the mini donuts and the ipsento latte. not usually a latte person, but this one impressed me! the mini donuts were pretty delicious as well. it's a little bit on the pricey end, but definitely worth it. i wish i got to try the nitro coffee too. it was super crowded and my friend and i couldn't find a seat at first, but people cleared out within five minutes or so. good service and excellent atmosphere and coffeeoftentimes crowded, but excellent for chatting with friends.on the first visit i have nominated this as my new favorite coffee stop in chicago.  i love the long hours, atmosphere, location, availability of booze, and delicious coffee drinks.  if they could make the original ipsento better, they did it!thought this was a coffee shop that was open late.  order an expensive coffee and sit down to work. apparently the coffee shop turns into bar mode after 7 and you can't have a laptop open.  i came here to work and no refund offered even though he literally just delivered my coffee. what a jokeit's about time i write a review for this place. i go here almost every day to work and get tea. my to go is the matcha latte with oat milk for the morning, and the molly weasly (this awesome chamomille/honey tea drink) for night. the book selection is really good and they have cute little nick nacks. they sell some pastries and the staff is super friendly. good wifi, comfy blue chairs in the corner, and great coffee and books. that's pretty much all you need to know.regardless of the sjw crap all over their windows, these owners purposely contribute to increasing homelessness!in addition to and in direct contradiction to the extremist signs on their windows, claiming that "billions of women" have "no voice" in america which is extremely obviously untrue, this business directly propagates, promotes, and participates in the disenfranchisement of a huge group that actually is oppressed...   homeless people.  this sign claiming that all human beings are not human beings, and therefore are not allowed to even pee according to this business, causes huge problems to and discrimination against not only homeless people, but, in the case of any such business in many areas of chicago including wicket park, this also disenfranchises, dehumanizes, and heavily discriminates against, anyone who is from regular suburbs and in fact even anyone who lives in a slightly different area of chicago, such as say, downtown, since for them as well it is also impossible for them to go home just to pee.  this business has several other antagonistic signs up to hurt and harm people.  it is obvious that this business should not be patronized.i first heard about volumes from a friend, then another friend, then another friend, and knew i had to go. it's a great bookstore/cafe, which really enhances the study vibe i was hoping for. they also have a whole section of harry potter themed drinks - i had the molly weasley which is amazing. the barista was super nice and patient as i spent 10 min trying to figure out the ritual app (where you can pre-order items from different places around the city and get points) too.the space itself is also incredible. it's nice to be able to walk around and get inspired by all the books, plus the tables on the wall are high enough to do some standing work when you need to stretch. i will 100% be back! to try all of the other menu items as well as go to one of their many book-related/fun events!super cute and modern neighborhood cafe & bookstore offering gifts and children's items too! the children's section is very well curated and offers a thoughtful selection of high-quality and unique books for all ages. i bought a beautiful children's art-collage book inspired by the work of friedrich nietzsche, "nietzsche in shapes and colors." the blank journal and magazine selections were also impressive. bright, tidy, warm and welcoming space.volumes has easily become one of my favorite chicago spots. they have both coffee and books - two of my favorite things. the bookstore is not huge, but they have always had the books that i want and if they don't, they will order whatever book you'd like for you to pick up. at night, they have weekly and monthly events, including book clubs. monday: weekly trivia @ 7:301st wednesday: open mic @ 72nd wednesday: storytelling series @ 7last wednesday: ladies' comedy night @ 7:30book club categories include book of the month, sci fi, feminist, and trans & gay and you can just show up for themthey also make good coffee - the oat milk honey latte that i had recently was to die for. there are usually tables and plugs available to work on your computer or read. highly recommend this spot!my bookstore/cafe in wicker park. love this place. staff is always friendly and helpful. cafe items are great! wish they had more sales or a discount program better than save 10 when you spend 100, but 10% off is better than nothing. and as a graphic novel guy, i wish their selection was a bit bigger, but still...very cool place in a great neighborhood.free wifi.came here to do some work on a weekday and was happy with my choice. cool bookstore to browse through with unique books and gifts available. the vanilla latte was delicious and the chocolate with peanuts muffin went well despite it being a bit dry. such a great find; definitely planning to returnraspberry mocha coffee drink with a ton of beautiful books around me. love this place and the service is so nice!volumes has a great atmosphere and because of it, it's an awesome place to sit and read (hence "book cafe"). nonetheless, it's a good choice to have some quiet time for a few hours.and now, the coffee. it's relatively cheap for an upscale-ish place. the serve metropolis coffee if that means anything to you. their special beverages and pastries are quality too. i enjoyed a chai latte. it was (how you say) aesthetically pleasing and tasted great. they also have a wide selection of books to choose from. i, myself am not much of a reader so i can't say much about the selection. however, i would come back for some of their open mics and other events!this is easy. volumes is a one of a kind experience in this city, and i don't just mean because of the book/cafe hybrid. it's because of their insistence on being a part of this community, and making sure that anyone who walks through the door feels like they belong there.the book selection isn't vast like a barnes & noble, but it is very intentional and specific. if the is a book you want, they will gladly order it for you. i will say, i love their poetry section, add the kids section is pretty dope too.the coffee drinks are mad inventive, always tasty, and often book themed. the molly weasley is a personal favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of the bronte sisters. oh! and they have boozy coffee drinks and alcoholic codes and beer if you want something stronger.they often have readings, performances, and workshops, and the team here makes it a point to find ways to give back to their community and chicagoans in general. plus, rebecca, the owner, is just a cool person.i highly recommend.love this coffee shop/book store/knick knack shop! wifi is great and there's plenty of large tables and outlets if you need to get some work done. plenty of unique and interesting curios for gifts. and best of all books, real physical pages of ink and paper!! there's an adorable back corner for children to read and relax. looks like they have lots of neat events all the time (yoga, book signings, education, etc). their drinks are reasonably priced, caffeinated and alcoholic, and the muffins are scrumptious, will definitely be making this a regular spot!i came through for wicker park fest and this place has arrived since i last visited the hood.  i wish i lived right by here because this is an awesome reading/studying space with a hydrid bookstore/caffeine infusion station.  it's not quite a traditional bookstore: the selections are more curated/limited but they have a lot of interesting contemporary selections (most that you don't see in other bookstores), not as many classics.    a good mix of new and used, plenty of things to browse.really love this spot! there is a great selection of current titles + some autographed copies! i snagged electric arches by eve l. ewing and was stoked. they also have coffee. (i didn't have any so i can't comment on it at all.) the owner was super nice. i plan on swinging by again next time i'm in chicago.great spot. super convenient on public transit by both buses and trains. the place seems to be divided into two. one area for the food and another for the books. great drink selection, i went there on a cold rainy day and the warm latte really hit the spot. as for the seating, there are a few tables set up in the cafe area, if you choose to read and eat and also a few in the store itself if you only wish to read. there was a good selection of outlets too so this is 100% a spot you can come work at. as for the books themselves, there is an excellent selection. you can choose from children's books to bestsellers. they also have puzzles and little toys to choose from. i really like that they have some pencils already laid out for writing. they also have 3 book clubs that meet usually on the second thursday of the month. you can just drop by whenever you want! the three are: book of the month, sci-fi/fantasy book of the month and feminist book of the month. i would suggest reading these books even if you can't make the event. (they have very good choices each month)my highlight however was that this place has $3 blind books and the money all goes to a charity. however you can only buy these with cash.legit giving this place 5 stars because of the matcha latte itself. there are so many cafes in wicker park i feel like volumes is somewhat underrated. volumes is 80% bookstore and 20% cafe. the cafe is just a little counter with a small selection of drinks but their matcha latte is the best matcha latte i have ever had. it's definitely more creamy and sweet but that's why i love it so much! the space is super cute as well. you can grab a book and sit there and read. there's even a children's nook just dedicated to younger consumers. they also have a lot of non-mainstream books supporting local authors or poets as well as unique greeting cards. i will always come here for their matcha latte!this is really a place where you can take some time out of your afternoon and have a cup of coffee.  the staff works fast on making your coffee and they let you do your own thing.  now, they have a pretty expansive book selection with categories that you wouldn't find at a lot of places.  i picked up the cocktail manifesto and having the cafe a few feet away to sit and read it at was great!  i only wish they offered a more expansive sweets section.  great neighborhood spot.one of my favorite places in wicker park. curl up and read a book. participate in the readnings from local authors, have a coffee or a red wine whichever you prefer. volumes has a great collection of books, especially their scifi section(my fav). they also reward you for your loyalty with a points system that helps you to save a few bucks. lastly, you can sell back gently used books for book credit!!friendly staff, great coffee (metropolis is the best), small bookstore, and open seating right off milwaukee ave in wicker park.such a cute little bookstore in wicker park! it's really well organized, perfect for people like me who walk into bookstores and feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of literature in them. they have lots of options for drinks in their cafe section, they even have 3 tea lattes named after harry potter characters! i got myself the ginny (an iced matcha goodness) and sat myself at one of the tables with one of the books i picked out. it's a great place to catch up with friends or rest up after digging through so much vintage.i love spending time here. not only do they have good coffee, seats, and wifi for getting serious work done, they also have a delightful collection of books, cards, and general souvenirs for readers. having grown up buried beneath books at local bookstores (in a foreign country), this place feels strangely nostalgic and even a bit home.love this bookcafe. it's got plenty of table space for you millennials to work at. and coffee and drinks at a reasonable price. i love love loved the ginny, which was a matcha peppermint latte that was $4. never thought of matching up peppermint with matcha but it worked soooo well. it inspired me to buy my own peppermint tea bags to try to make it at home. they also have alcoholic lattes which i thought was unique.volumes has everything you want: an area for kids with many excellent picture books and a nice selection of ya lit, lots of great recommendations by staff, coffee, fun book nerd gear and a good mix of old and new literature.bookstore cafes are my favorite kind of cafes. it just makes sense. some people go to a cafe to read (especially if it's cold outside) and you want a nice cup of tea or coffee in a nice warm atmosphere. this is the place to go! plus, it already comes with the books.they have one of my favorite matcha lattes in the city! i rarely get a grainy powder matcha texture that quite a few places give me. before i found volumes, i was only limited to starbucks for a matcha that was not overwhelmingly bitter. i also love that they have readings and talks there, too. you are able to sit in the cafe during a talk, but you have to stay quiet. so don't be afraid to go in and have a look.we sought out volumes on a wicker park tour of bookstores. enjoyed reading and getting some new books for myself and kids.i'd give this place a 3 for food/coffee but a 4 for environment. i still haven't gotten accustomed to metropolis coffee- it's too sour for my taste. berry scone had a good filling but was too dry. wonderful place to study though, with lots of outlets and plenty of comfy seating (i came here because wormhole was full, and was not disappointed to find ample seating). will revisit when i need to get work done. the harry potter themed drinks were very creative, i will try those next time as well!went there yesterday and now volumes is my favorite coffee place! good service, fast internet and the best latte i've ever tried!thank youthis bookstore is truly a hidden gem! i first noticed this bookstore because they claimed to be a coffee shop as well. as a coffee addict and bookworm, i knew this cafe was calling my name. the interior design of this bookcase is so modern, clean, and organized. i would come here to study/read/work everyday if i lived in the area. they hold reading/speaking performances every so often. they also host authors at this bookstore, so i would definitely recommend stopping by to possibly run into an author ;)one of the most wonderful bookstores i've ever been at. with a vast selection of coffee to enjoy at the seating area, volumes book cafe provides a very comfortable vibe to do work or read at.bookshelves have short synopsis written by staffs, recommending intriguing and exciting staff picks. volume bookstores feels very welcoming and seems like a great place for any book lovers to hang out at.this an amazing place to have a coffee, meet up with friends to catch up, or just get some work done.their book selection is great, and it's fun talking about different books/ series with the owners. they have a great kids book area that makes it easy for your kiddos to have something to do while you're sipping or browsing. they have a full events calendar and have something fun to take part in any day of the week! check them out!first visit today and really liked it! it's really clean and aesthetically pleasing so i'm sure i'll be back to sit and read and relax. i loved the simple lay out and also really into the blind date with a book idea! i didn't have cash so i'll have to come back to buy one (it goes to charity so cash donation for that only).absolutely love this book cafe. very cute little book store that also serves you drinks. one of the best spot at wicker park. they also have benches in the book store section that let u sit while u flip through the books, magazines. they also have a section for kids. and even a clean bathroom. how good is that. why do we not have more book cafes like that ? i am used to growing up in book store as a kid and just wonder how kids these days don't have the opportunity to do that anymore with the technology and internet. oh by the way, the staff were super nice too! highly recommend their shop.i love volumes! this place is a book store with a cafe! i love a few doors down and this place is def my stop after work to get my "i made it through another day of work latte." they have a rewards program applies to all purchase books/cafe etc. $1=$1 point after you spend $100 you get 10 back. it's the best when i get that $10 reward it's like 3 or 4 ice coffees. i don't generally buy books i'm not as avid of a reader as i would like to be. i have gotten some nice jigsaw puzzles from them, as well as, adult coloring books and good little gifts for the avid reader in your life. the staff is very friendly and a knowledgeable for book recommendations. i really love this place great spot to check out in wicker park.independent all the way!stopped in on a wednesday night to this great neighborhood bookstore. coffee, tea, wine, free wifi, books...i mean fabulous well-curated books (including a section of cool banned books), and lots of events/happenings.what i really love about volumes is the kids book section with a kid-friendly reading area. from little kids to middle school to teens, it's one of the best collections i've seen in a seemingly non-kid part of town geared towards hipsters.here's a rundown of the events they regularly host:- trivia night every monday- storytime for kids every wed/sat morning 10am- open mic night every 1st wednesday- all lady comedy showcase every last wednesday night (i was there during this night)- book club meet ups every monthcafe tables, bench seating, and comfy area for kiddos. great lighting, great vibe, in a really beautiful storefront. can't get enough bookstores in my life, so i wish this place the best. cool!i am not one to write bad reviews. i generally give people the benefit of a "bad day" or what have you, but this was a little much. the service was great, the shop was great, and i was very excited to read the book and write in the journal i purchased, until i opened the book. there are (what i can only assume to be) blood stains on the pages. i don't mind fingerprint smudges, i get people pick up and put down a book endlessly. this was not okay though. everything is still 100% legible and the stains are minimal, but there are multiple pages with the corners of edges with red or brown streaks and smudges.this place has quickly become my new favorite book store in chicago! great selections at super cheap prices! they have some used and overstock books super cheap in great condition and the newer works are well selected and reasonably priced. cute cafe attached with yummy drinks and down to earth attitude. as an avid reader and literary nerd, i am quickly becoming a regular.almost there at least once a week, this is my go-to cafe whenever i need a place to sit down and write. the coffee is great and is decently priced compared to coffee shops in wicker park which are more often than not over-priced. it's clean and casual atmosphere always manage to put me in my creative-zone and help me focus even though they have regular author events happening in the evening, and half of the space will be taken up for the events.i also enjoy browsing through their wide range of greatly curated book selections. they recommend and feature new books almost every week. there's really nothing to complain about this cafe except for their customer service. nothing too major but i'd always expect baristas to be a lil but more engaging and friendly given the welcoming nature of coffee shops.came in here with a friend on a monday afternoon. we were looking for a spot to have a beverage and chat. i got a soy latte - it was amazing! i was pleasantly surprised, great coffee here. my friend got a whiskey boozy drink which he enjoyed. they actually have vegan baked goodies which is a nice plus although i didn't get any this time (during my visit the selection included peanut butter cookie, banana nut muffin). i like the book store aspect - it was fun to browse through and i like the selection that is available. the cafe had a "library" feeling to it - it was strangely quiet, everyone else there was on a laptop with headphones. we were the only ones talking and i felt like i had to whisper. some of the patrons who came in to grab a to-go drink and browse the book selection were chatting while they were there. we ended up leaving to find a different place to sit down and have a conversation.i'd certainly return for the great coffee if i needed a quiet place to work in the area!well, as i mentioned in my check in, i am a big supporter of local community establishments such as volume bookstore cafe as i believe they bring character to a community, and, also bring the community together via their casual welcoming cafe environment.i was there last week and asked for a copy of sapiens, which they did not have in stock. i was told they would order it and it would be in on wed. i did not order or reserve it. i just went back (wed) and there it was, as promised. i could have gone home and sat on my duff, pushed a button on my ipad and had it shipped to my apt, probably at a lower cost, but, that doesn't make for great communities or employ our local community residents with living wages. i don't live in that hood, several miles away actually, but felt it important to support them.i was especially thrilled to hear that they were also a women owned business.  delightful people working there and delicious coffee. show them some love!i'm raving about this new addition to wicker park... a charming, independently-owned book store with its very own cafe. it's owned by two sisters with backgrounds in education. and it fulfills two of my biggest passions, caffeine and books! yesterday, i came here on a mission... to purchase a children's book for my neighbors, who are recent first-time parents. in the back of the store, there's a section devoted just to books for children. volumes has a super selection. there are even a couple of pint size tables where the little ones can read and do activities. after looking through dozens of books, found one i hope my neighbors will love as much as i do.this is a pretty large space for a local bookstore. the majority is devoted to grown-ups. the shelves are stocked with many current sellers, plus lots of vintage books i hadn't thought about for years. an avid reader, i could do some serious damage in this store!in addition to books, there's a cafe with baristas, and lots of seating where you can sip caffeine (or wine and craft beer) and work on your laptop. didn't look like there was much in the way of food except for pastries. and compared to a starbucks, which can get really noisy, volumes is almost serene. i'm looking forward to literary events as unique as they are.volumes bookcafe is another gem in the heart of work. they have a great selection of titles and their drink offers are spectacular! i recommend to anyone looking for a nice drink to relax, or a fun literary event to attend. great place for a social meetup or to study.great local bookstore/cafe in the heart of wicker park. they have a variety of fiction and nonfiction, as well as a section for children's books. they haven't always had a book i was looking for but the order process is very easy and i've gotten any order within a week. it's also a great spot to sit and do some work. the cafe has good coffee/latte drinks and free wifi. also it's super cute. what's not to like?volumes is an amazing place to find the books you didn't know you needed in your life! they have an extremely thoughtful selection of books and an awesome place to work and enjoy coffee in the front. i love coming here and finding new books! they have a great selection for kids! i found a few bi-lingual books for my baby sister that i am really excited about. the staff here is extremely kind as well! the "staff picks" section is something you need to check out. i had a lovely experience here and i love coming in when i am in chicago.was pleased with this bookshop cafe - i liked their book selections. some of their books are author-signed, and they have different activities scheduled. i could spend a whole afternoon here but was pressed for time so would definitely come back.i love the idea of a bookstore in a coffee shop, or a coffee shop in a bookstore...i love to explore coffee shops and have been waiting for this spot to open! finally came here with a girlfriend at 9a--i wish they did open earlier, as much work is needed to be done a little earlier.workers are super friendly and knowledgable with their inventory for the books! they are fairly new--wish they will have some food items..they have some pastries as of now!just had their coffee as i needed to get some caffeine in my veins--was really good! not your ordinary pike place (as an avid starbucks goer and my to-go-to)! they have beer and wine on the menu--how amazing is that--i will definitely be grabbing some sort of alcoholic beverage as a reward when finishing my work next time i come in!i really like the whole bookstore + cafe setup. not as crowded as the wormhole cafe next door and a slightly different vibe. plenty of power outlets to get work done. i don't drink coffee but their hot chocolate was pretty decent.love this place! tasty drinks, wonderful staff, and a great selection of books. can't wait to go back for their book club events!i stop in here whenever i'm in wicker park and it's a favorite stop of mine. the book selection is curated carefully and i've found many gems and authors i would have normally not known about. there are little recommendation notes all over (the mark of a well-read staff that enjoys helping indecisive people like me).the coffee and drinks are really good, the space is open, clean and bright. they do some really cool events here--bookclubs, open mics and such. i caught the preview of an opera showing here once which was awesome. my only complaint is that every time i'm in here i spend way more money then i intended to (on me, not them!) i have to say that i've grown into a voracious reader because of it and volumes is always worth it.the name says it all. nice morning cup of joe or an afternoon beer with a good read. up to date books with a nice selection. fun reviews from the staff on all different categories and guest appearances from authors. this isn't you're grandmas book store. clean, comfortable, and chill environment. check iti wanted to love this place so much, and join their book clubs, and support them...but... overpriced lousy drinks, awful parking, and rude staff will make my first visit yesterday my last.super cute place. the lighting and decor is very open. there are tables and outlets all along the wall making it a perfect study or work space. i came for a women's open mic night. it felt like a very open, safe space environment and really had a good laugh! solid cafe drinks.great independent bookstore/cafe!loved the bright, clean feel of the atmosphere. the seating was ample and variable (large desks, high-tops, small desks, kids reading/seating section. metropolis brews are offered here, in addition to alcohol, cider, (newly added) irish coffee, and  an assortment of baked goods. staff is cheery and welcoming. events:they have a book club that summons once a month. they have open mic nights every first wednesday. they have story time for kids. trivia night once a week. and many more.great bookstore, cafe, hangout, event spot.  i've been coming here a decent amount since they opened and have always enjoyed the place.  the book selection is on the smaller end but its more of a "hand picked" selection, so you're getting quality over quantity.  good selection of fiction and non fiction and an easy to follow layout.i've gone to a few events and have always enjoyed them (women's comedy was great).  the atmosphere is friendly and communal and i enjoy playing their collection of board games.the staff and helpful and friendly and the owner is highly engaged in the day to day activities. .calm, cool atmosphere to relax over coffee browse books, play games - an underrated escape from wicker park within wicker park.watch out wicker park, there's another adorable bookstore in town! it's a great combination of a coffee shop and a bookstore, basically a book worm's dream! although the selection isn't huge, they have most of the ny times bestsellers for you to peruse. they also host events here, such as readings and discussions with authors. it's a nice place to come browse some books while sipping on coffee. there is lots of seating and outlets for those who need to do serious business on their laptops. they have a nice seating area for kids as well. the mood is work-conducive, hip, and chill. love it!awesome place to hang out if you have hours to kill. there's a café with friendly baristas in the bookstore and plenty of space for working on a laptop. there are newly released, old classics, used, and many more of all genre of books. i like the layout of the store because even though it included a café, seating area, book shelves, the bathroom, and people, it didn't feel crowded. the bookshelves on the sides had featured books that the employees recommend with a short written note that told what the book was about which added a personal touch to the shop.the decor in the women's restroom is adorable, go check it out ladies :dvisited here during the national poetry slam and i'll remember this as one of my favorite book stores i've ever been to. not only was the atmosphere beautiful, exceptionally clean, chic and comfortable, but the selection of books (and children's books especially!!) was top-notch. and that's not even mentioning the cafe. i didn't need any books while i was there, but they also had an awesome selection of literary-related odds and ends, from candles to bags to puzzles and more. i ended up buying my mother's birthday presents here, which she loved, and a gorgeous trendy notebook that i've been getting oodles of compliments on. but the cafe, you guys!! i got one of the yummiest lattes i've ever drank there (named after a bronte sister, and i commend any coffee shop that has the first menu item named after a female author!!) plus my friends got a yummy juice, and delicious cookies, served by a sweet and funny (and fashionable) staff. im just so happy with this place, when i'm back in chicago i'll swing back by for sure.this place is great for so many reasons. there's a great selection of books to choose from and they always seem to have something new. the coffee, tea, and other specialty drinks are perfect on a cold day. to top it all off, they have a variety of events to choose from. i love taking my tot to the story time events. oh! and this place is on the freevo app as well, so you can get free drinks when you buy other stuff.. win win!coffee's good and the book selection is excellent. it has a few chairs and comfortable seats and obviously every coffee shop hopper loves a great shop aesthetic. i'd like to make a note that it is woman owned and local. so the obvious answer is why not?have had nothing but a+ experiences here! most recently, i needed to buy a book being released by my favorite author, and they ordered it for me (no upfront cost to me) and it was delivered on the release date. i simply got an email it had arrived. perfect!i've also been to trivia here. i like that they branch out and do fun events for the community. the first time i popped in was to buy a birthday present for my niece. i sifted through all the children's section had to offer; for a small place, there was a surprisingly large collection!two comments that would definitely give volumes that fifth star:-the seating is cafe-like, which functionally makes sense. if you want to drink wine for days and read a book, likely won't be the most comfortable venue. would like to see some plush seating added. -when i went to shop for my niece, i had no clue what i was doing. the woman at checkout confirmed both books were stellar purchases for her age group. i think it could have added some charm if a salesperson had also made some recommendations while i was was shopping. great bookstore, cafe, bar even, social club...check it out!edit: been here a bunch more-- their trivia night is a blast, employees are always friendly, kinks ironed out. 5 stars it is! this place is wonderful. i am an avid reader (mostly fiction) and a snobby coffee-person who has worked in a few third wave coffeeshops. i have long dreamed of a place that combined these passions, where i could drink a latte and enjoy my latest literary find, and volumes hits the mark squarely. first off - the place is not huge. but there are a few choice comfy seats scattered throughout the shop, and about a third of the space is dedicated to the cafe and table and chair type seating. there is a precious and comfy reading nook in the children's section as well. but if you are looking for a huge bookstore with anything you might want already on hand, you won't find that here. but i believe that is a positive point for volumes. instead of all the books you kind of heard of and all the books you don't really want, their wonderfully curated selection of books includes new bestsellers no one had told you about, well loved classics, and plenty of books that were somehow exactly what you were looking for. they can always order what you need, as well, so take that, amazon! additionally, the space is well organized and designed, a joy to move through. their cafe is also lovely. they serve metropolis coffee here, which is not my favorite in the world, but quite good nonetheless, and local. i think it will take a little more time for their baristas to master the perfectly poured espresso drink, but everything i've had has tasted delicious, and that's what's important. their chai is spicy, their lattes are smooth, and their beer and wine and cider (!) selection is both larger than i expected (4-5 of each) and quite nice. i especially recommend trying one of the ciders. they are huge and potent and delicious. the staff here is still ironing out kinks, which is to be expected for a place that has been open just a month, but they seem to be well trained, and are very welcoming and friendly. the kind of staff that notice what you are reading and ask how you like it. the owners are also always around and very friendly and knowledgeable. overall i am in love with this place, which is a nice little literary haven that is open and friendly in a bustling neighborhood known for hipster condescension. i love wicker park, but this place has racketed up my appreciation for the area several notches. 4/5 just because they do have a few kinks to smooth, and because i am waiting to see how their plans for many events and community evenings (readings, games, and trivia, etc) pan out. but i am sure they will be wonderful and i'll be back soon to tick that rating up one more! welcome to the 'hood, volumes!really great place to sit down with a drink! you can come in with a friend or two, bring work, study, read--you can really do it all here! there are some high top tables along the wall, along with lower tables in the center. what i really liked about the seating is that there are smaller tables available, but also longer tables with benches set up as well! really a nice set-up; doesn't feel cramped at all. what i really liked about volumes bookcafe is that the area up front is designed like cafe and the middle-rear end of the establishment is designed more like a bookstore! it's a really great ambience and i enjoyed browsing their book selection and the staff picks!what a wonderful neighbourhood spot. the ambiance here is fantastic. they have board games up at the bar, so you can check some out and play games in the afternoon or come here to enjoy coffee and a read. also a great place to do work if you're looking for that kind of cafe! i would definitely come back!favorite coffee shop in chicago. friendly staff, cool events, nice drinks. love love love! lots of books and magazines and board gamesnice place to hang out with friends and play board games for hours!! love the vibes there.nice little independent book store ! bright and welcoming atmosphere. i appreciated the thoughtful arrangements of books . i like the little owl cards that offer a brief description/ review of some of the books and would like to see more of the employee reviews of books! maybe a list of favorites? just a thought! books are expensive and i always appreciate another readers opinion before committing to a $30.00 + purchase ! i will definitely be returning ! however, not for the coffee.. the americano , while priced competitively, was not very good at all and was a little on the bitter side. much better coffee just up the street.. worth it for the books though!cute cafe bookstore hybrid with good coffee and very interesting/personal book choices displayed (you'll see a lot of books displayed on the front shelves by black,queer, female authors which is very nice and cool!) there's always an event going on. closes pretty late so it's a great place for late night coffee/book shopping. an amazing addition to the neighborhood.what an amazing spot in wicker park! everyone support this local bookstore /venue!! great selection of books and a wonderful variety of events to check out at night as well.my favorite coffee shop and study area in wicker park! the place is set up in such a cozy and comfortable way that it makes it such an ideal place to study and get work done on a rainy or sunny day. i come here all the time to study!i just want to say that i adore this place.  the entire staff is so friendly and they make the customer feel right at home! i do wish there was a larger selection of children's books, but that can be overlooked because of all the other great things about it!i fell in love with this place on my first visit. the children's section has a place to sit and read as many books as you want. another great thing is that teachers receive a discount on all purchases.sleek, modern set up and would be a great spot to study or get work done. my favorite part was a shelf near the cash register featuring a couple of books wrapped in brown paper with small drawings and short descriptions of the book inside. they call this "blind date with a book," where for a $3 donation you can select a random book and be surprised by your selection after purchasing it. i think that is such a unique way of discovering new authors and exploring new topics, and the money goes to support local schools, which is always a good cause. i definitely recommend stopping by here, browsing the shelves, and maybe treating yourself with a surprise book.locally owned, hip, comfortable, smart, clean, eclectic, no pressure, and not overpriced. destination worthy.for me, it's perfect. it isn't large, but it's well-done. they have some cafe drink, a few pastries, and plenty of books. they seem supportive of local authors, and provide a space and activities to encourage the writer. this is not a space for someone to sit for hours or spread out their homework, but it is a nice place to get a coffee and chat with friends. or pursue the new book selections. or get a start writing your own.4.5/5i love this place!!1) cute, nerdy, but fitting bathrooms2) child reading area3) variety of books for sale, both new and old. mostly ny best sellers but still a variety of books, there are some lounge chairs around the area that allows you to just kick back and read4) mini cafe inside, the drinks - eh, so so. nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done. price is reasonable.. typical $3.50-$5.50. i got myself an iced vanilla latte. it wasn't anything special, but i still enjoyed it while studying there5) about 20-25 seats available to study, read, and lounge at6) free wi-fi7) dope environment/atmosphere8) great location in wicker park9) plenty of outlets all around the study areai will definitely come back here!super cute place!! i was hoping for more cozy seats to read/lounge, but the cafe seating is more than fine. i love the book selection- mostly best sellers- and they will special order for you if they don't have what you're looking for. let's be real, it's not a barnes and noble that has a million different titles. small but cute gift selection as well. there's a rewards program in which you give your name and email and for every $100 spent you get a $10 credit.in regards to the cafe, i don't drink coffee so i got a chair latte. it was warm, not hot (but tasty nonetheless) from a barista with a chip off her shoulder, but that's whatever, she made a good drink in a timely fashion.  small baked goods selection but the brownie i had was delicioussss. overall, i will definitely be recommending to all of my book loving friends!cute boutique and coffee house, but too eclectic of a selection (and not many copies of each book- so each time will be a mystery on what can be found). staff picks are very contemporary, but not trade paperbacks easily accessible in other places. a lot of local chicago authors. i don't know how this place stays open...i. love. this. place. great for a quick cup of coffee or to sit and read for a while. it's a gem on milwaukee. for the size of the bookstore, they have a great selection of reads. i just go and browse for fun.it can be hard to rate a place that's just opened and they are still figuring things out. i'll keep going back and see if they have improved and update my rating. for now, i think 3 stars is right, especially when you compare what's just down the street from a coffee and book store perspective. i love the concept, i thought before they opened what kind of cool cozy environment it would be. but it's not. it's half a small book store, half a cramped coffee shop with packed seating. there is another half book store, half shop just down the street (toms) that does a much better job of using their space. if you want to buy a book and get comfy and read, you're going to have to take it somewhere else. i grabbed a vanilla latte and it was served in a plain black mug. again, maybe it's just an opening week thing but i hope they serve coffee in better mugs going forward! the latte was just ok, a little sweet for me. it does look like a decent selection of books and easy to navigate. i'd say go check it out and let them iron things out as they get going. welcome to the neighborhood!i used to love this cafe until i was served by a very rude employee at volumes bookcafe. i ordered an iced chai and i waited for 20 minutes until i had to go up to the counter to ask what happened to my drink. there weren't many people at the cafe and the lady who took my order previously was taking other people's orders and making their drinks. i kept my cool together and kindly asked the lady who took my order, "i ordered an ice chai..i was wondering when it's going to come out?" and she responded , "oh....yeah haha...i...totally forgot about it....:)". she didn't even apologize one bit and had smirk on her face which was very offensive. she made me feel less of a person. she was obviously rude and obnoxious that another employee had to apologize on behalf of her. the cafe is lovely but i don't think i'll come back here again. it was a very unpleasant experience.  it is honestly very unfortunate to see cafes lose customers because of rude employees.the combination of a bookstore and wine shop is essentially my version of heaven. the events here are phenomenal, the staff is incredibly helpful, and this place is definitely worth a visit.visited last weekend. great service and good coffee. they found the book i was looking for which was an added bonus. i look forward to coming back. they had a beer tasting in the back with solemn oath which was a nice surprise. i know this has been in business for a year but it's a great addition to the neighborhood.i love this place. they have a reward program for the regulars. although i am a lover of classics, this place has a fresh selection of the latest and greatest books. their coffee bar is amazing - great hot cocoa with marshmallow (very light and not so sweet). their sitting space is ample and inviting. also, their staff notes commenting on the book put a caring touch and a make a great difference. a must visit in the wicker park area!my new favorite study spot. i was originally planning to go to wormhole next door, but i didn't even have to go inside to see that the place was packed on a sunday afternoon. so, i wandered five steps north to volumes and was pleasantly surprised by the number of open tables. i didn't feel like getting anything caffeinated, so i opted for the matcha latte which honestly just tasted like hot milk, hence the four, not five stars. however, it's a good little spot for studying/working/catching up with friends, so i'll definitely be back for the ambiance.i really like this place, love that you can get coffee or wine and read at one of the tables. i do wish there was a slightly larger selection but that's ok.i love supporting local businesses so decided to stop in here to get a kids book for my nephews. selection is small, but that's ok. more fun shopping for books here than on amazon and i liked the book i chose. long story short, their credit card system was "down", so i had cash and paid that way after they swiped my card and said their system wasn't working. when i looked at my credit card statement and saw i was charged there as well, i called the shop, as paying almost $40 for a kids book isn't ideal. 5 days pass, no call from the shop so i call again. eventually i connect with kimberly the manager i guess and she makes it sound like it's way too hard to go through their records and offers a store credit. i said i prefer a refund, she says she will have to get back to me. 3 more weeks pass and i have called every few days with no resolution from the establishment. pretty frustrating and unprofessional, seeing that they didn't care to resolve the problem. i won't be recommending people here.i loved that this place doubles as a book store- lots of comfy chairs to sit and read as well as tables for doing work. the prices were also great (not too expensive) and the menu is pretty large, including alcohol!very comfortable place to work with stable wifi and great coffee. they serve metropolis coffee here and have lots of cute trinkets around the shop. i love the bookstore vibe combined with the coffee shop. i would say that the working tables are not large and i prefer huge working tables. the tables are a little wobbly as well so be careful of your drinks! they have lots of cool events planned during the week so it really feels like they're trying to be a community.overall, very clean, comfortable, and they have fun board games and free coloring which seems super fun!volumes is one of the few cafes i know that serve alcohol! get tipsy and enjoy a book :) this is a wonderful place to work or peruse some novels. it's bright, friendly, and relaxing place to be. the layout of the cafe allows you to find your own nook... and book to settle down.not sure how such a calm and productive coffee shop managed to open up in the heart of wicker park! fully equipped with a beautifully designed bookstore, plenty of seats and outlets, and a decent beer & wine list. there's also a little kids section tucked into the bookstore side of the cafe!beautiful bookstore. it is a really nice workplace with a lot of outlets. i had the matcha latte which was absolutely delicious. love the vibe and will be coming back!love this place. work just down the street and i go in for a cup of hot tea a few times a week. staff is friendly and accommodating. great selection of books.i love the concept and had a great experience here! the employees are nice, and my friend found a cool book of poems. the books are definitely more main stream, but i enjoy the vibe and the decorations are cute! i will definitely be back!this place is so cute! they have an awesome reading corner by the children section. finally a place in wicker park where you can wine and read. :)i love this place.  great selection of books (it's a small place so it doesn't have every book ever published....just a very nicely curated selection).  great kids section with nice seating.  perfectly nice cafe/seating area.  an array of coffee/tea/wine/beer beverages.  my only only only recommendation would be to have at least one vegan cake or snack option.  i wanted something to go with my coffee but  there were just a few pastries and no animal-free choice.i really wish there were more book cafes these days. this one is super cute and welcoming, with free wifi and clean bathrooms. if i lived in wicker park, i'd be here everyday, i think. the book section is a somewhat small, but that only adds to the warmth and coziness of the place. definitely worth checking out if you love books.a wonderful place in the heart of wicker park. my friends are i frequent different neighborhoods in the city and when we strolled in volumes, we loved it immediately! it's an uplifting place to browse for books and have some great coffee, including an ice frappe and some tasty treats. the place is bright and new, yet cozy enough to want to stay for a while. the staff is friendly and helpful.we really like volumes and when we come back to wicker park, we wouldn't miss going again. they must be very tuned into the neighborhood since they have so many events in their store. great idea and certainly builds a community within a community. in general, i felt along with my friends, that this is a place where you can feel the almost camaraderie of the customers. you feel wicker park in volumes.fantastic selection of books both indie and mainstream, great support of local writers and best of all? great drinks and pastries.it's a small shop and could certainly use more seating but they only have so much space. they work it well and employees are always kind and helpful.this is the place to get almond milk hot cocoa. trust me.this place could not be cooler. it's everything an independent bookstore should be: well-curated, with coffee and wine and a great staff, plus great readings and open mic nights.they have fantastic storytimes on wed and saturdays at 10a. i think it's the best new place for kids. their kiddie section has a super-comfy "windowseat"  covered with pillows to which the kids are always drawn. behind it is a tall wall with a window, that sort of separates this large section from the rest of the bookstore, so we like coming bc my squirly kids can be hidden from the "adults." there are two kids tables for coloring, reading, etc. this week they have a castle sitting out for the kids to color while they're there, which has been a hit with my kids.a unique experience. upon walking inside wormhole coffee you'll be transported to a place filled with items from an 80s time capsule. there is a decent amount of seating but it's usually packed. bring headphones if you want to get any work done on your computer since the ambient music is louder than most coffee shops.beverages and service are slightly above average but let's be honest you're going out of your way to experience the atmosphere here not be blown away by the coffee beans.if you like craft coffee mixed with 80's nostalgia mixed with video game memorabilia then you have to pay a visit to the wormhole coffee. it was packed when i came in on saturday morning and the coffee is worth the wait. my friend ordered the koopa troopa drink, which is like a peanut butter cup in liquid form. i was kicking myself for not ordering that while i was waiting for my hand brewed coffee. but for coffee lovers, the rotating selection of brews is excellent here. the baristas know what they are doing, my coffee came out perfect. surprisingly it was a great temp where i could basically immediately have a sip once my brew was ready. the atmosphere is amazing. i love all the intricate details they have placed throughout from the stained glass nintendo to the delorean in the back. i wish i lived closer so i could come here more often, but it's def on my list as a must visit to take friends when they are in town.i love this place!! my only complaint is that it's difficult to find a place to sit. all you 80s babies will get real nostalgia vibes from this place - from the decor, music and even the coffee titles. the coffee is able to match the cool ambiance. my personal favorite is the peanut butter koopa-troopa.. smooth and creamy peanut buttery goodness. it is in a cute area and there are some awesome thrift stores near by that are worth checking out!this coffee shop is the mf bomb and i love it! i love the vibe here! not sure if it's because it reminds me of brady street coffee shops in mke or if it's because it has that cool hipster vibe bay view has but i dig it and i continuously find myself here whenever i'm in wicker park. they have a delicious latte called the koopa troopa that i highly recommend getting. i'll be back here for sure whenever i'm in the windy city. give this place a try!wormhole is definitely a trendy/hipster modern day spot where they bring back memorabilia from the 80s. they even have a model size back to the future car and a old school macintosh computer. they have alot of cool signature drinks on their menu. however - keeping with my standard - you have to try their hot black coffee or cold brew to determine if their coffee is on point. i opted for the cold brew since it was a hot summer day. i would have to say i am relatively disappointed. the cold brew fell really flat. no flavor whatsoever and way too much ice. dissapointing. cool coffee shop concept - need better coffee.edgy coffee shop! great music, knowledgeable baristas, and fast service! it has a lot of nostalgia in terms of 80's and 90's movie memorabilia! ghostbusters, gremlins, aliens and more! i got my iced soy chai latte: i was impressed! 5 stars! there is ample seating inside and plugs for all your devices to charge! there is also outdoor seating as well. this will be my office for the morning!this place has plenty of character, and at least a few unique options for coffee drinks. i had the 'cool but rude' and it delivered a pleasantly memorable coffee experience with strong hints of ginger and curry sauce. health concerns aside, the overall taste was better with whole milk versus skim milk.it's also worthy to note that the decor inside the place was fantastic for any vintage 1980's fan. from the delorean from back to the future to the original game boy to an original apple computer, there are plenty of bits of eye candy. overall, i'd certainly recommend trying this place at least once.easily one of my favorite spots to get work done. if you order a tea, they prepare it with loose leaf tea, and provide a free additional steep if you'd like. not a bad spot to hang out, but most of the people here seem to be getting work done. dimly lit so if you're not next to a lamp, i could see it being difficult to read if you're bringing a book here in the evening. employees are friendly as well.not your typical starbucks, this place is one of a kind.i love all their 80's movie theme decors/menu, it really made the place more hip. cute spot to chill.hi um the coffee here is great :) actually just had probably? the best latte of my life last night from here (honey bear). i love the vibe of this place. i'm a huge nerd and really appreciate all the star wars and pops i saw throughout the shop. such a cool little gem in chicago.this place brought me back to my childhood with nintendo's, movie posters of awesome 80s movies and just a funky vibe! it's the only coffee shop i've ever been to where you can just be you and you won't be judged by anyone! the staff are very friendly and kind and that's the main ingredient to a great coffee shop! it should be like you real home, not your second home.their coffee is...well, let's just say you won't be disappointed! brought to you from halfwit coffee roasters, so you know it's good stuff, but it's just made with a lot of nerdy coffee love and i guess that's what makes this place such a cozy hangout spot for the all time fans of the 80s or for those who just wanna go somewhere cool and just being themselves. i had a special latte called a shot in the dark (not sure if it's a reference to the movie) but it was might good!what a cool coffee shop! i love, love, love the decor! takes me back to my childhood.  want to take a picture with keanu reeves...head on over. also love that there is a couch seating area in the back with old video games.  totally creates a great ambience. what a gem in wicker park! close to blue line on milwaukee it is also quite convenient to get to.coffee and service is great as well.  will surely be back.  seems to be pretty crowded but surely it's for a good reason.cozy old school coffeehouse. the vanilla bean and peanut butter koopa troopa were both excellent. decandent and good enough for both satisfying my coffee and dessert urge. only wish they had more pastries available though.my so fell in love with wormhole's coffee. i tried their honey bear latte and i have to admit that it is one of the best tasting coffees that i had i  chicago. drinks:honey bear latte: a slightly hint of honey and latte. very nice and good under a rainy day. koopa troopa: peanut butter mousse mixed in as a latte. my so likes it but definitely not my fave. i like my peanut butter in solid form. ambience: very very cool ambience. a very 80s feels with a back to the future car in the back. furbies, pop figurines and cat paintings on the wall. definitely a sight to see. coffee bean: bought several types of coffee beans here. they ate roasted by half wit roaster and we gotta say it's pretty good (espresso wise). a local chicago roaster and we will be ordering more online!ps. they can do a little more work on their latte art. lol :)i'm not a coffee drinker, but i would go to any length to get my paws on a peanut butter latte: the kooper trooper. wh is a trendy, hipster modern day wormhole that transports you to the 80s/90s, and everything old that people love to resurface. like, an antique macintosh. i do not belong in any of these sentences, yet i was still welcomed with the smiles and aroma of some quality coffee. hop on over, even if you aren't a coffee drinker!spacious enough for personal space or group parties! nostalgia, anyone??pretty cute spot with video game and movie references, lounge area seating, and tasty drinks. most of my friends and i ordered the peanut butter koopa troopa lattes, while one ordered the honey bear and one ordered the cool but rude latte. i was hoping the koopa troopa would have more chocolate flavor (not too much of a pb fan) but it did not. nonetheless i still liked it and it wasn't overpowering. i tasted the cool but rude and would have liked that better i think. i would probably come back to this place if i'm in the area to check out their next specials and have a pastry!back to the future car, 80s music, old movie posters, first macintosh, floppy disks plus really yummy caffeine concoctions so what is there not to like?! order koopa troopa or vanilla bean and hangout and you're are set!fun 80's themed coffee shop in the heart of wicker park.  where else can you grab coffee and see a delorean (like the one from back to the future)?  they also have old nintendo games you can play to transport you back in time.  there are many tables and seating options throughout the shop and also outside. the drinks are pricey, but no pricier than a starbucks. the $5 cool but rude ginger & curry sauce latte i tried was delicious. both the ginger and curry flavors were subtle, but present. the honey bear has a fancy name, but it's a simple coffee drink that's delicious in a simple way.  there's paid street parking, but may be hard to come by. free on sundays.....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .  (   ` - ` -  ' - '   '  - - - ' ' ( _ / . _ ) - ' ( _ \ _ )if you are a sci fi movie fan from 1980/1990s, wormhole is a must-stop!  buy some half wit toast coffee while you are there. and did i mention....the best latte i have ever had. cool but rude latte with ginger and curry. outstanding. bottom line, they had me with alien facesucker on the millenium falcon. you rock, wormhole!came here on a sunday around 11am to meet a friend from out of town and instantly loved this place as soon as i walked in! the ambience is super cool and they have a variety of unique coffees.  they have lounging chairs, couches, and table/chair options.  they also have a cool spot in the back where you can play video games!the service was super good and the workers were friendly as well.  i had the honey latte and it was super good- i would definitely recommend it / get it again. the orange blueberry scone was also very very good.  the flavor was rice and it was a nice size.  i spent about $10.50 for these two items.they also do offer milk subs such as almond/soy.very cozy atmosphere with a hint of retro!there is street parking (free on sundays).  it did take me about 10 minutes to actually find a space and still had to park 2 blocks down - but not terrible!  i would definitely recommend this place and cant wait to come back!  i wish it was closer to my house.hi, my name is casey and i'm a caffeine addict. it doesn't matter where i go, i make sure to get my fix in. anyway, during my last trip to chi-town, i came across this awesome coffee shop. the chai latte that i ordered was delicious and i'm a sucker for latte art so they get bonus points just for that. definitely my favorite coffee shop in chicago not just for the drinks but for the atmosphere. if you're looking for a chill, hipster, 80's/90's vibe, this is the place for you. they've got a delorean on display, nintendo games on an old tubular tv and decor such as et, sesame street and lunchboxes.if i didn't have to pay for parking, i probably could spend the whole day there. i would definitely find myself back to this place the next time i'm in chicago.*** workspace ***it's a bit dimly litted and most of the seatings are for lounging. if you're the type to work sitting on table, your only options are a big communal table or a hanging bar table nailed to the wall. it's not my preferred work space (esp. because it's always bustling) but i come again and again for the delish coffee and to relax surrounded by geeky retro memorabilias.*** coffee ***phenomal and one of my favorite go-to cafe. it was love at first sip. all their drinks have personality (in both name and flavor). each drink is unique but in general all of them have a well-balanced spice notes.a coffee shop gem that is right around the corner from my new spot. lucky me!my go-to is their lavender mint latte with oat milk and activated charcoal. what's amazing is i don't even have to be boujie, (or however you spell it), they're already boujie themselves! #winthe inside is decked out with old school movie props (i'm never familiar with this sort of thing since i haven't seen nearly enough movies). they also offer a ton of free stickers with fun quotes. the only reason i give them 4 stars is because you can't come here when you're in a rush, like before work. sometimes that's a great thing but it's too bad because now i can only enjoy them on a weekend.nothing wrong with a nostalgia trip now and then (heck i dressed up my son in vintage ocean pacific for 80's day).  from the movie posters to doc brown's delorean, there are bits and bobs of fun pop kitsch all around to catch your eye and steer your conversation away from it's topic for a bit. my friend and i met up for caffeine and convo and loved pace of this coffee shop. great place to work, read or meet up. my honey latte was delicious and the croissant was perfectly buttery and flaky. there's table seating, communal work table and comfy couches. laid back friendly vibe.  can't wait for max headroom to start working the counter.wormhole is such a cozy coffee shop with a very friendly and attentive, great regular and iced coffee, and rotating specialty drinks.there are a number of different seating options, even a couch with video games. plenty of outlets, as well.good latte and chocolate chip croissant. neat decor inside with back to the future delorean inside. not sure if it's one from movie but definitely a delorean. nice indie coffeeshop vibes!!one of the best places for coffee in chicago. i got their vanilla latte last time i was there and it was delicious. i've also gotten their regular coffee and really enjoyed it. they have a good selection of sweet coffee drinks with solid black coffee as well. they have a small selection of baked goods but you can't go wrong with their croissants. the staff are super friendly and the staff is super attentive at keeping the space clean. the space itself is very cool. there's a lot of comfy seating and you could actually play their old 90's games. the controllers were a little old and didn't work quite right but it was still cool to see. if you're in the area definitely stop by or even if you're not in the area it's close to the l!what a great find! my boyfriend and i happened to walk by this coffee shop and i'm so glad he convinced me to check this place out. walking into the coffee shop, we immediately loved the 80's and 90's decor with the delorean from back to the future, the old school apple computer and floppy disks, and all the movie poster paraphernalia displayed everywhere. i ordered the cortado and my boyfriend ordered an iced mocha. our coffee came out extremely fast and i loved it! the cortado was strong (just the way i like it). my boyfriend also enjoyed his iced mocha. in addition, the staff are super friendly. i will definitely keep this place in mind the next time we're in town.i have come here a few times with a girlfriend of mine who lives in the area. the coffee is tasty- i love me some cold brew! their muffins are delicious, too!the place has a retro/hipster style and i enjoy the fact that the seating is set in a way that you sit next to strangers while you all are doing your own thing. and since i love meeting new people, it sets up that opportunity, too.the only reason i'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the service is kind of abrupt and not as friendly as it could be. otherwise, i enjoy hanging out here for a coffee&reading session.i adore the quirky feel & nerdy decor of this coffeeshop. there's a variety of seating from chairs to cozy couches. the lighting towards the rear of the shop is quite dim so just a heads up. the wi-fi is reliable & fast. outlets are kinda sparse depending on where you sit. coffee is always good. i haven't had a bad experience yet.this place has 80s character and good drinks to boot. i ordered their seasonal shot in the dark latte, with lavender, mint, and activated charcoal and wow!!! wasn't sure what to expect, but the flavor combos really work. we loved the 80s decor and broken-in couches- such a great place to hang out and play some cartridge video games (mario, tmnt, blades of steel, link), grab a spot at a table to work, or sit at their coffee bar close to the barista action.i had to go to wicker park for a event and was looking for a place to meet friends in the neighborhood.while browsing places on yelp came across this place with pretty good reviews and especially reviews from sarah and alex compelled me to try this place.the decor is unique and pretty youthful with old unused car on the attic ,macintosh and old telephone which gives pretty good vibe.service was pretty good and quick.i tried the honey bear latte and it was good and friends had cold lattes and they loved it.cons:free wifiunique ambiencepatioreasonable pricesunique tastecheck this place and you will like itthrowback thursday phoenix begins on a chicago wednesday with a song called blue monday....i am a believer! believer!! capital b. this wormhole works. it's about time i fire off these five stars given that i drank up another peanut butter koopa troopa (pbkt) yesterday, snapped a never-before-done photo (by me) with the "my other car is a delorean" bumper sticker," flew out to phoenix last night and today...driving along i-17 north and what am i coming up on...a delorean!? the delorean.  "outatime"  total replica, only 30-some in the world. not only that, dude exited same ramp as did i so we ended up in a walgreen's parking lot - having a chat. he loved it that i showed him my photo of the wormhole coffee.  so back to the future...long have i loved this house of coffee, from when i first set eyes on the delorean (among other retro stuff, especially the mac) and when i first set lips on this pbkt - a peanut butter mousse, dark chocolate latte. yeah.  so, indeed no, i have not had any other drink here - not even my regular black coffee.  how can i drink anything else when the pbkt is like drinking a decadent, rich peanut butter and chocolate souffle.  i liken it to a souffle because it's just so perfectly airy and rich. creamy and delicious, not at all overly-sweetened. and i'm not a latte or "fru fru" coffee drink person whatsoever.  i don't even mind that - when i'm sitting on that comfy couch - that i figure out how old i am. it clicks that i'm listening to remakes of what i listened to in college. by the way, nice job, "orgy" on not screwing up "blue monday." and then, i remind myself that i like the '90s and beyond music too so i'm  not that old after all. phew. you're young. you're thin! get a pastry. they have donuts, assorted cookies and a chocolate candy bar maybe even...and one time, i know i got myself a macaron here.  i did!....  (december 2014 but i'd wager they still have 'em)if you need a sugar fix, a caffeine jolt, a pbkt kiss, a blast from the '80s past or a trip back to the future...this place has you covered. hey, all that and bumper stickers too. i swear it's how wound up standing behind the bumper of the delorean this fine afternoon.think a 80s and 90s throwback vintage coffee shop with a great menu and latte art, but high prices and slightly disappointing coffee drinks. this coffee shop in wicker park has been on my bucket list for quite some time now, and i am sad to say that it didn't quite measure up to my expectations.first off, my mocha drink was barely warm when i got it to drink at the shop. the latte art was fantastic, but i could barely taste the coffee or chocolate flavor. it just felt like a mediocre coffee drink from quick vendor, and not necessarily a dedicated coffee shop. parking is hard to come by, but possible. paid metered parking on milwaukee ave, and free street parking in the residential area behind the coffee shop.we loved the selection of lattes, but we weren't impressed with our orders. the vanilla latte had vanilla bean flecks in bottom of the cup (which is amazing in theory), but we honestly couldn't taste it. the cool but rude latte (with curry paste and ginger), was extremely sweet, though i loved the spices. the decor is quite a scene. i might bring friends in just to see the interesting wall art and back to the future car installation. not much seating.the wormhold is a neat little place, decked out in 80s decor. the coffee was good, which is the main reason you'd come to a coffeeshop. however, i was underwhelmed by the baked goods. for me, i love to pair my coffee in the morning with some form of a baked good, whether it be a donut or a muffin or something else. i tried a few items from here, and they were all only okay. the donut was interesting- very, very dense, and not like a donut at all. i tried a muffin as well, but i guess since everything is vegan, they taste different than i'm used to? certainly not bad, but not what i was expecting. i know most people love this place though, so i guess it just wasn't for me! coffee and service were both great, however.nostalgia is a funny, fuzzy thing. it's also a powerfully selling tool and this cuteass geek-chic coffee shop delivers 80s nostalgia in glorious spades. i mean, they have an actual delorean (the time machine from back to the future) inside. it's as if they're actually sending you through time. meta. it is worth noting that most of wormhole's patrons (and staff!) are likely born after the 80s. like i said, nostalgia is a funny thing. you can be nostalgic for a time when you didn't even exist. not that this applies to me. i'm old and definitely on this earth before the decade came to a close. anyway, my regular drink order is the "cool but rude." it's a ginger + curry latte. sounds insanely weird but is actually subtle and delicious. i've also tried the peanut butter koopa-troopa. it's not bad but i don't love  peanut butter flavored things. it is a top drink choice for many though. the vanilla bean latte is also popular, but seems like such a plebeian pick. but hey, your choice. conclusion: a must visit if you're in chicago and into anything quirky, sci-fi, geek-chic, nostaglic, 80s...all of the above.the wormhole coffee brings you back to the '80s, with its great collection of tmnt, star wars, ghostbusters, and back to the future (yes, a replica of the car was situated on top of a makeshift divider) figurines, posters, and other paraphernalia.  in addition, they have locally-roasted coffee, vegan donuts, and hot/cold beverages, including ever-changing specialty beverages.  a group of us came here after having lunch in the area, and the place was noticeably super packed!  we ordered: the koopa-troopa (a peanut butter mousse and dark chocolate latte; more strong and bitter, with a slight hint of peanut butter; came with a nice latte art on top); holy water (with jasmine green tea, melon, and honey, iced; this was super refreshing, and while it was more melon-based, i really enjoyed it!); a regular glazed donut, a sprinkles donut, and a crumbled frosted donut.  the yeast donuts were large and airy, and tasted pretty good.  there is a hodge-podge of furniture - solo chairs and sofas where you can do some work, play catch-up, and/or to just relax.  imagine a friend's living room where you just hang out.the place isn't much for large groups, but maybe up to 3 people.  i loved the '80s decor, and i'd be interested in checking out their other specialty beverages that seem to change often!some residential parking can be found off of milwaukee.+holy water+vegan donuts+'80s decor+limited seating+limited parking off of milwaukeemy type of place! video game themed and cool spot to hang out. i like their cool but rude latte with nice ginger spice in it.an 80s coffee shop run by someone who used to run darwin's in cambridge? seriously that is awesome. the space is filled with 80s memorabilia including plastic and tin lunchboxes that i just wanted to take down and bring to work, discs next to a macintosh computer (pictured), and just a funky vibe. was in the neighborhood and decided to stop in, i definitely want to do work there soon to take me back to my baby years especially bc there must be more to see on the wall. oh and i ordered a soy chai tea with a croissant. yum!not enough seating for the amount of people coming in and out. chai was definitely made in-house, but had too much cinnamon for my liking. staff seemed friendly enough though, and the 80s decor is awesome. update: came in a few days later and tried the koopa troopa. the peanut butter balanced the strength of the coffee nicely. could've used more chocolate in mine, but will likely reorder this.love the coffee and the specialty coffee drinks if you're on the mood for something different and maybe a little sweet. i can honestly say that i'd come back for the decor as i had i'd come back for the coffee. it takes you straight back to childhood in the 80's!  super fun to sip your brew and check out memory lanethis is probably my favorite coffee shop. i love how they decorate the shop in the old fashioned way! i definitely enjoyed playing the mario game on nintendo. it brought back the memories i had in the past, i missed playing the game! i had a chai & my boyfriend had dopp something i forgot what it was called. it had peanut butter and dark chocolate in the coffee. he said the peanut butter shouldn't go in the coffee, but it was ok. however, i loved my chai! (not pictured)when i sober i like coffe there but i dont like place too much. staff its ok when i am drunk i love peaple who work there when i got hangover i hate them lol ... but coffee its amazingwhen i am high ... i realy recommend brown sugar... its amazinga 90's kid haven! what is there not to love about this place! nintendo and coffee, chill hipster vibes, delorean car display, awesome art, all in the heart of wicker park. yes please! an overall good spot with tasty treats and drinks! nuff said!loved the 80s nostalgia, the atmosphere was fun.coffee was okay. not my favorite. i had the troopa and i didn't like it, hubby had a vanilla latte and it was goodeasily top 3 best coffee shops in chi. i've given less than 10 five star ratings on yelp. coffee shops around the country should take note. this is what a game looks like:- creativity designed decor: homage to old school films like back to the future - probably the friendliest, happiest, and quirkiest team- the specialty lattes are actually balanced with the right flavor profile and balance without losing the essence of a latte. most places stick bunch of random ingredients together that sound good on paper but betray their coffee essence and taste horrid. see how it's done - get the honey bear or the curry latte.excellent coffee - i can't remember what they use. it's quality stuff. maybe a wee bit overpriced for chicago, but whatevs.i used to go here when i was unemployed (*sobs*) and during the day there was almost always table seating. my roommate said weekends are awful, though, so i don't bother. it's also a little dark inside for my liking.overall, great coffee and a decent workspace.had a cold brew yerba mate with ginger and lime drink that tasted nothing like mate, but was still okay. the music they were playing, however, was terrible and made me have visions about entering the gates of hell.very cool place. it has a back to the future feel to it. i had a lavender and mint latte and it was super good. the flavor was awesome. no need for any sugar which is rare for me. the pastry selection is very nice.cool spot with quick service and good coffee. definitely a good area to spend a day working or just relaxing. love the touch with using mugs for those dining in.great coffee, great ambiance.  loved the decoration and the service was great/super friendly.  and the novelty of the delorean is definitely worth the trip alone.i have to say, this place is spacious on the inside and gives a cosy atmosphere, and adding on top with the retro gaming vibe. i got the honey bear latte when i visited here; if your looking for a subtle sweet drink, i would recommend it. my friend and i were able to find seating on the couches in the afternoon and the service was quick!what a wicker spot. the coffee is warm, welcoming, and strong and the atmosphere is odd, unique, and 80s-90s themed. great place to sit down with your computer, book, etc. and get some work done.this place is unique to say the least, got the iced koopa troopa which only comes in the small size but it was good. best thing about this place is they let you bring donuts in from outside even though they sell their own there. pretty cool !one of my favorite coffee spots in chicago. love the music and the nostalgia 80s decor. i like to sit here and read or journal. when it's crowded on weekends, it can be a little hard to focus on work though, more of my go to leisure spot. the specialty drinks are on the sweet side, but experimental and i like the lavender charcoal latte when i need a break from the usual black coffee. from the han solo cardboard cut out, to the floppy disks, the details in this shop are just so on point. love it.so, i moved to the chicagoland area this past september and i haven't had a chance to write any reviews about the places i've visited here yet. but wormhole definitely deserves a shoutout. overall, this place is awesome. i absolutely love the vibe/theme of the cafe which is a nice throwback to the geeky side of the 90s with tons of decorations that really make you want to dig up your old comic books and action figures. my favorite decoration was the lifesize delorean on the back wall. they even have a cathode ray tv set up with classic nintendo games in the back and the music is fitted to the theme of the cafe which i thought was a very thoughtful touch. as for drinks, i definitely recommend the honey bear latte which comes with a seasonal honey or the koopa troopa which has a nice subtle touch of peanut butter and dark chocolate. but honestly all their drinks are great and they serve extremely smooth coffee drinks -- some of the best in the chicagoland for sure. unfortunately, this brings us to why i didn't give the place 5 full stars.  the place is a little bit small for how busy it gets mostly in terms of seating as there are a lot of people who come here to do work/read/chill. not really a fault of the place but the bigger issue is that the drinks are definitely on the pricier side. expect to pay about 4.50 for a small latte here. but one does have to keep in mind you are paying for a lovely drink and setting so that definitely makes up for it.this is a great spot for doing work or for hanging out with friends! i visited after work on a tuesday and it wasn't packed at all. i ordered the honey bear latte with honey (soy milk). it was absolutely delicious.i will definitely be coming back here and i recommend this spot to anyone who appreciates a nice "hipster" coffee shop. it's in a great location- right by all the shops and bookstores.one of my new favorites. thank you, man behind the counter with black hair and a beard - you steered me right with the cool but rude latte. holy smokes. and to think i was considering a simple vanilla bean latte! lol me. the cool but rude is perfection - don't get thrown off by the curry. it's spicy and sweet and got that hit of ginger that you didn't know you wanted. this was my first time in and it won't be my last. i love that everything here reminds me of my childhood and that there's plenty of couches for me to come chill on soon.best java and fun atmosphere!  the baristas creates yummy drinks!  wish they were in the suburbs.the koopa - troopa is a1. love the peanut butter + chocolate hint! their customer service is amazing and their workers are so friendly.i was walking around with my friends when my boy told me to try this place out. i was shocked. i never looked back. the moment i saw their menu, i damn near fainted. the creations were some things i've never seen before. the one that caught my eye was the coffee w/ in-house made curry sauce & ginger. this was one of the most unique coffee drinks i've ever had. from the first sip to the last, it just gets better. the best thing about it, the curry sauce & ginger is well pronounced and has a soft kick. these are one of the coffee drinks i'll never ever forget and something i'll keep craving. this is just way too perfect.this place has wonderful gourmet coffee but has a very chill and nerdy vibe that also doubles as a truly safe space if you happen to be of q***r identitymy favorite cafe by far in chicago.  great coffee and they make fantastic lattes with interesting and seasonal flavors.  my favorite year round is the honey bear latte which is delicious without being too sweet.  had the seasonal cider/beet/thyme drink which was delicious and he best cider i've ever had.  you could really taste each and every bit of each ingredient (except maybe the beet which was probably used for just the color).  tried a pastry as well which was great and not stale like many coffee shops.  will come here over starbucks any day.  great decor with nostalgic pieces throughout- limited seating and lots of people loitering around with laptops.  they have a punch card - buy 10 drinks and get one free!as a person who was born in the 80's and grew up in the 90's, "wormhole" reminded me of the good time during my childhood and adolescence.  we saw cartoon lunch boxes placed along the walls, "lisa" apple 2 computer found on the condiment table, and a random "michaelangelo" from teenage mutant ninja turtles leaned against the window by the front door.  no, that wasn't an exhaustive list of knickknacks i spotted.  the seating arrangements kind of took me back to my college years, with comfy sofas, large communal tables, and the clientele.  i felt there was something in common among most patrons who hanged out there.  the space was somewhat similar to a community lounge in a university dormitory, except there were too many activities going on at the same time.  i would get easily distracted if i were to try to finish my term paper.  fortunately, hubby and i came over for a quick coffee break after work; no tricky mla or apa format that i ought to pay attention to.  the hours are great, 7am to 11pm daily.  they serve "halfwit coffee."  if you purchase a bag of coffee beans, you can get either a free 8oz. coffee or $2 off on anything else.  the cta damen blue line station is just a few blocks north of wh.awesome place to get coffee with friends! love how they have a nintendo. it took me back to the golden years of being younggotta love their koopa-troopa peanut butter mousse and dark chocolate latte! try it, you won't be disappointed!great place. they have the old school video games, my son loves. i come here to get some work done in the winter sometimes.when people come into town, i take them to wormhole b/c it makes me seem cool, with 80s & 90s pop-culture memorabilia all around the shop.wifi is consistent here, and during non-peak hours it's pretty easy to find a spot, though they're not the most comfortable seats.my one issue with wormhole is that on my last visit, i ordered a cortado to-go and the cashier said, "we actually prefer to make cortados to stay, but we can do it to-go as well.""ummm okay. i'll take it to-go then....."*silence*lol what??? what does wormhole gain from making cortados to stay? does the integrity of the drink decrease when placed in a paper cup versus ceramic? is it against coffee etiquette (i can't believe there's such a thing, in america nonetheless) to sip cortado from paper cups? maybe they keep a limited amount of mini-cups and they don't want to use them all nilly willy. who knows.anyway. yes, cortado to go please. thanks.i could not wait to write a review for these people. everyone was so sync with one another.andreas was very passionate about the shop. tory was so knowledgeable about her craft. i wish you all the best, i truly do.you guys have to check this place out. they have such an awesome theme , and even though it is dedicated too displaying different memorabilia , it still looks like a calm and casual coffee shop.the decorations support the coffee shop feel and are not one bit overbearing.i love this place. stopped by while waiting to be seated at a restaurant and needed some tea to warm me up while i waited outside. they had a pretty good selection of teas to pick from. it was a bit pricey than average but the taste was definitely worth it. i'll be returning to chill and read a book.known for their lattees, they are delicious and well spiced but pricey. the decor is a wonderful vintage nerd-town collection, bathrooms are clean and genderless, but usually very busy and not many tables for being productive, it's more of a social atmosphere.the decor and atmosphere are great.  a safe space for people of all orientations, genders and nerd levels to have an oat milk cappuccino.  the microfoam, coffee and tea were excellent.had the koopa troopa coffee and it was tasty! t had mocha and peanut butter in it. good for getting busy work done but music is a little to loud for studying. the place has a video game 90's vibe to it and all of the decor was unique. will definitely be back!place is very cool. love the retro throwback feel. drinks were pretty good too! i'd give it 5 stars but the two girls working there had an attitude and were not friendly at all. i mean if you aren't happy there don't work there lol. other than that great placerustic coffee shop with an old school vibe. providing locally roasted coffee that tastes simply amazing. strong and fresh. great for a social meet-up or studying with plenty of seating.the 80s. it's about trying too hard. trying too hard takes a lot of work. just like the 80s. explains why they don't have time to work on making the coffee good.how can you go wrong with a place that has a delorean inside?  you can't, people.  you can't.pb koopa-troopa is my go to, cause peanut butter and dark chocolate and espresso.  hot, iced, whatever.  it's 80's nostalgia name and an amazing flavor combo!chai and other fun summer tea creations are available too, and the honey bear latte is good for the non chocolate lovers.wormhole has all the details down, including their game controller punch cards and floppy disk wifi password display.  just the right amount of irony in a wicker park coffee shop.when i went to wormhole coffee it was as if i was transported to another time period by the decor that is inside of the cafe.i consider myself a coffee critic, i know a bad coffee from a good coffee quite easily, and i get picky if the title of the drink says it is "cinnamon or nutmeg" i then expect to taste that in my coffee.after taking in the neat decor of the cafe, i went to order and i got the honey bear latte to go and it still had cute heart on it, and it was sweet - but not overpowering. i know that i will be going back wormhole coffee, to try more of their menu items. it's a bit hidden on the block, but once you find it - you won't regret it.obnoxiously loud and terrible music playing most of the time making it impossible to read or work. employees are pretty chatty behind the counter too so no way to have any peace in here. the coffee is good, had the honey bear and the vanilla bean. yes this place is cool and quirky but it's not suitable to put down your laptop and get anything done.my absolute favorite coffeee !!!! i love this place, the coffee, the vintage, the unique atmosphere, the neighborhood! if i didnt live on the south side i would be here everyday! honestly the bestcame here on my biannual trip to chicago and fell in love. husband got a classic latte which he said was amazing & i got a seasonal rooibos peppermint tea which i also really liked. we visited midday during a monday and the place was completely packed-i can't even imagine what it's like on a weekend. we didn't try any of the food items, but they looked good, and several people had bowls of cereal with their drinks! overall we enjoyed the cafe and would recommend it to anyone looking outside of the normal coffee chains.cool place but i hate the coffee..they use ipsento beans which are acidic and gross.  i don't know how anyone can drink that and say they love itwormhole coffee is the quintessential hipster coffeehouse with an appropriate amount of grunginess. it has always been packed every time i come here, but there's usually some spot on some couch or chair, but i never expect to get a spot at the communal tables as easily. i've only had the koopa troopa (peanut butter & dark chocolate latte) because what else would i possibly want. overall, this is a great place to get some work done but maybe not if you really need to focus because it tends to get loud with all the music and voices.this place is super unique. every coffee i've had here has always been on point. seating can be tough sometimes but other than that this place rules.free street parking on sundays!! i came in specifically to try their koopa troopa, and was not disappointed. it was busy inside but the line wasn't very long at 4:15pm on a sunday. it took them less than 5 minutes to make my koopa troopa (peanut butter mousse & dark chocolate latte, 8oz/$4.50 + $0.50 soy milk, ), which was delicious! i could taste the peanut butter a lot more than the dark chocolate, but i really liked the richness and thick consistency of this latte. however, the soy flavor may have overpowered the dark chocolate flavor, so it may be more prominent with regular milk. i would definitely come back here to purchase some freshly roasted beans, try their pour overs, and of course, order more koopa troopas! they have a good amount of tables available inside, but it seemed like all the seats were taken by people studying or doing work. although the street parking was free, it can be difficult to find a spot since the street was very busy.the atmosphere is great however the redhead manager has a terrible attitude. next time you go ask her is they make cuban coffee....she will tell you that they don't do that here because our machines are very expensive and she doesn't want to put sugar in them. have you ever heard of cleaning your machines to satisfy customers!! i wish i had her name but she ruined the entire experience. even her staff was embarrassed with her crap hipster attitude......response to the below:this is exactly the point of my original review. it has nothing to do with the sugar, it's your condescending, rude attitude that made the the experience to your location awful. i prefer to review on my good experiences however your lack of customer service and blatant disrespect is what rattled me. thank you for your response because now everyone can see what i am referring to.super cool eighties-movies themed coffee place. i would definitely come back. the staff is funny and the warm chocolate is tasty.when i was visiting chicago, i made it a goal of mine to come here. it was even better in person. came here on labour day at around 9:40am, luckily it wasn't overly busy on that day. it was nice and quiet, a perfect place to work while enjoying coffee. service was wonderful and wasn't pretentious at all.my favourite part of the place was the details of the place from the nes to the floppy disk wifi display was incredible. the whole place was covered in 80's decor  and they even had a delorean- but this place wasn't all for show, their coffee is just as good! i ordered the cool...but rude latte and it was so flavourful and full of different spices.since it wasn't very busy i was able to play on their nes, they had quite a game collection. that part of the room felt very much like playing video games at someone's living room-ah the nostalgia and i'm not even born in the 80's haha.hung out at the wormhole on a saturday morning to drink some delicious coffee and catch up on reading my book. this coffee shop provided a cute 90s vibe - the gremlins poster on the wall sealed the deal. coffee was delicious and there was plenty of space to sit around and catch up on reading. recommend this spot for a down to earth vibe with some delicious coffee and plenty of chairs and comfy couches.we were in the neighborhood for dinner last night and were excited to check this place out after hearing about it from friends. it was busy but not excessively so. we didn't have an issue finding a place to sit. in fact, it seemed like seats were turning over regularly during the time we were there. maybe a function of a saturday night? customer service was great. the barista working the register was friendly and funny while taking our order and talking to us about the shop. it was a nice change from some of the barista drones i find at other coffee places. my husband ordered the macchiato. he said it was okay but not great. i had a vanilla bean latte, which was really good. there was a strong vanilla flavor that melded well with the espresso. and, in contrast to larger chain coffee shops, the vanilla wasn't cloying or sickeningly sweet. the decor is fun, especially for 80s kids (or people who have an interest in that era). my husband and i loved the old lunch boxes on display and reminiscing about the ones we and our siblings had. the delorean is impressive, of course, but i was more enamored of the smaller, nerdy touches -- video game character magnets made out of perler beads, stickers, etc. also, i found this sign (see photo) on the table near our seats and love the socially conscious way wormhole is doing business. we're glad to support them in this and will absolutely be back.love this coffee shop for its eclectic decor- my favorite is the back to the future car. i also spotted an astros vintage lunchbox which made my heart fill with pride especially after our world series victory (i was wearing my astros hat as well ;)) the staff is friendly. the coffee shop was packed sunday afternoon- so it's a local favorite. my soy vanilla latte was oh-kayyy- not as warm/hot i would like it to be. my friend loves their jasmine green tea.fun and hipster vibe going on in wormhole. vintage displays all around the shop! definitely not a place to work or study for me. great place to meet your friends. i don't drink coffee, but i decided to try their cappuccino. it was okay, but i loved the teddy graham on the side. so cute! some of the seats are kind of uncomfortable. but i definitely recommend this shop for people who are into both the 80's and coffee.i'm an 80's baby and this place hit me right in the feels. talk about cozy and nostaglic! the baristas were fun, friendly, and fantastical and their awesomeness can only be matched by the food and drinks. they even offer some vegan pastries! a++the coffee is warm, but the service is not. my "hey how are you?" was met with an anticipatory blank stare as if my friendliness only exacerbated his impatience. my friend got the same vibe. the coffee was good though. ‍pretty cool coffee place! this place has an interesting mix of hipsters, coffee snobs, and 80s nostalgia. it looked like it would be a good place to sit and work for a while, or just hang out. i got the cappuccino, and while it was expensive, it tasted great. it also came with a teddy graham on a tiny spoon which is kind of adorable.amazing coffee, friendly staff, array of baked goods, and space. we ordered the peanut butter koopa troopa latte, honey bear latte, and the breakfast donut! both lattes were fantastic! the koopa troopa was creamy with deep notes from the peanuts with this roasted flavor. the honey bear was perfectly sweetened, creamy, and topped with a delicious and luxurious foam. the breakfast donut paired well with our lattes. the donut itself was dense with a sweet glaze topped with oats and cranberries. we really enjoyed the interior of the space with its open space, plentiful seating, and light shining from the windows. being there and enjoying the food and coffee just makes for a really good time!this place is a little hard to find, since the sign is just a wh on the outside. the service is fast and polite, and they have a great atmosphere inside. i ordered a jasmine tea and it came with a french press for more tea if i wanted. there is  a couple of spots to plug in and get work done on work tables and a couple couches to just hang out as well which i liked a lot. i came in at around 9:30 and the place was pretty empty, but by 11 it started filling up. in the back there's an old game console (n64) which you can play, and some games like scattegories and scrabble. definitely felt the "hipster" vibe here.one of my favorite places in the city to go grab a cup of coffee and clear my head. by far some of the friendliest staff i have ever met. great coffee, and not too expensive!for a while i thought that dollop in the loop served the best hot chocolate in town. but this place is better. the crowd is cool and there are quite a few power outlets. great place to hang out and get stuff done.does your coffee shop have a back to the future delorean inside of it ?80s toys and  movie posters ?a tv with a  nintendo playstation and games ?a funky random music playlist ?  delicious coffee including a ginger /curry coffee and honey bear latte ? friendly fun staff?i  i didn't think so !these are just some of the reasons why this is my my favorite little  neighborhood coffee shop. i basically get the same thing every time i come in here . cool but rude ,a ginger/curry latte . or the honey bear latte  ,which is exactly what its sounds like ,honey latte .they also have delicious pastries and macaroons incuding a jameson caramel macaroon i had here once . seating is usually pretty good if you need to use the wifi. theres 3 long big tables ,couches and a diner style bar  table .although during busier times it gets jam packed and you wont find any. i only wish this place was on my way to the blue line before work .one of my best coffee shops in the city and thanks to imran shakur, one of my coffee crime partner and i hit this up a while back and the rest of history.  it is hard to come across a place like this everyday so i really get out of my way to go here whenever i am in the city.  you will enjoy coffee and non-coffee related drinks but i would recommend you steer clear from those since caffeine is where it's @.i have tried their cortado, hot chocolate, pour overs as well as cold brew and everything really is legit.  the people that work here take coffee seriously so do not take a lot of pics and disturb them while they are at work!such a badass spot all 80s themed! ordered the honey bear latte i believe it was called soooo good!! also grab some stickers they are free hahatalk about a blast to the past! this place serves up delicious coffee along with a satisfying serving of 80's nostalgia. while it may not stand out from the outside, it definitely fits in with the ambiance this place exudes, because as soon as you enter, you are transported to a cozy  laid-back cafe with amazing service and decor. when we went, it was a bit crowded and difficult to find seats with a table, yet we obtained a seat at the bar where we watched and conversed with the baristas about other great places in wicker park (was it obvious we were tourists?). we ordered a koopa troopa and honey bear latte (interesting names!), and they weren't overly sweet, which i enjoyed. the latte art they put is rather "artistic" also, which you should be sure to appreciate... haha.overall, this place is definitely a must see in the wicker park area and is very close to the damen blue-line stop. service is friendly and the vibe will make you want to stay and relax for a while. once you enter the wormhole, it will be hard to escape! :)such a cute place! i had my usual, a vanilla latte, and was not disappointed. the latte art was great and made me feel like a lot of care was put into the drink. i didn't try any pastries as i arrived a bit close to closing time, but i'm looking forward to trying some in the future. the atmosphere is great, very retro although i didn't get the full 80s vibe the shop boasts. the back to the future car in the back of the cafe is definitely awesome though!really cute hipsterish coffee shop. kinda has a nerdy theme with a dalorean sitting atop the wall.they have cute decorations like star wars mugs and an old apple macintosh pc here you fill up on sugar and created. the names of their drinks are pretty clever too. i believe i ordered a koopa troopa which had a pretty latte foam flower in my cup. lots of seating, free wifi. and it was pretty busy for a sunday afternoon. we sat at the bar where you can see the baristas making coffee and it looks like a science experiment when they use they're instruments. i also had a yummy blueberry lemon scone. nice and crumbly, and messy.great coffee, interesting selection. come here for the atmosphere: 80's pop culture. enjoy your tea with alf lunchboxes and a back to the future delorean above your head. sit on one of the couches in the back and play nintendo (the cool console from the late 80's). i chose super mario bros. 3.terrific atmosphere, superb customer service, delicious food.mocha puffs was delectable but cinnamon toast was mediocre. i seriously liked my visit here. i will likely visit again.wormhole always has very talented baristas, quality ingredients, a perfectly hip atmosphere, and unique drink options. last time i was there i had the cool but rude, a latte with ginger and curry and it was awesome! they somehow find ways of combining ingredients that no one else thinks of and create espresso masterpieces. two other musts are the koopa troopa (peanut butter latte) and honey bear (honey latte). in terms of food, they have some pastries, cereal, and easy to grab and go savory croissants. i was pretty impressed by the ham and cheese croissant - it really hit the spot for a small tie-me-over after work but before dinner. don't come here expecting a full meal or anything though, that's not their business.some of the other great perks include ample working space (there are always a few web designers and graphic artists working on their laptops here), free wifi, an awesome tv/nintendo/couch setup to play classic games to your hearts desire, and a friggin' delorean floating above everything. yeah that's right, they have a delorean. there are also great figurines, posters, a classic mac, and other pieces of geek history strewn around the cafe. there's also a well stocked shop for all your home coffee needs (chemex, pourovers, beans, etc.)wormhole is definitely part of the heart of what makes wicker park cool, and whether stopping by on my way downtown or even driving in from the suburbs just to come here, they've always delivered consistently great coffee and a great experience.best coffee place so far!!!i have been trying the bazillion (roughly) coffee shops in chicago, and this one is amazing.  went in and first thing i saw was the ninja turtle greeting you at the front door.  then i looked up, and saw hans solo and the delorean.  what a unique twist already right?then came time to order a drink.  while some were your classic coffeehouse drinks, some were unique, in the best way possible.  the prices are great, and are very reasonable all things considered.  the service was great. friendly, quick, and extremely pleasant and not cold and bitter like a lot of places like this in the area. this place is small looking, but deep once you enter. and in the hour i was there, never slowed down.  with the quick service however, it was never an issue having to wait for seating.a great spot to work from when you're on the run but also a great place to hang out. they have vintage seating with video games set up for a group. i worked all morning from wormhole and had the honey bear latte multiple times. if you're deciding between the starbucks and wormhole, the vibe is very worth the extra walk down milwaukee.i got the kuppa troopa special and i loved it!! also who doesn't love a spot that has a delorean in it!with the "stranger things" series craze on netflix, this was the perfect time to travel back in time through wormhole coffee! the cafe theme here is extremely hipster and geeky/techy - it's unlike anywhere else i have ever been. since i didn't grow up in the 80's, i can't say that i used to watch/play all of these things growing up, but it sure felt like i could travel back in time and play video games through their old tv and nintendo console. all of their furniture is eclectic, different, and mismatched. their sugar and milk station is set up like an old office desk complete with the original apple monitor and have plenty of puzzles and board games. the seats were completely full on a saturday afternoon, but we were able to snag seats on the couch by the tv. although this place is clearly for doing work or studying, i could also see how it's perfect for friends to lounge and play games too! you can get the best of both worlds here.i was contemplating between the peanut koopa troopa or the honey bear latte. when i tried to ask the barista about the sweetness of the drink, and whether it was too rich (since i don't like my drinks extremely sweet), she seemed annoyed that i didn't understand that those are the sweetest options. i decided to get the honey bear latte less sweet and of course it was too dull for me. i was able to adjust at the milk station. i wish the barista was more thorough in her description of each drink.my boyfriend opted for a kemex, which was freshly brewed and presented in a kemex beaker and additional mug. i liked how the coffee was extremely fresh! it takes a little bit longer, but it's worth the wait.adorable atmosphere, and some of the most creative coffees i've ever had! got the shot in the dark--lavender and mint latte with activated charcoal--and it was 100. my friend got the koopa troopa--peanut butter mousse and chocolate latte--and it was also 100. and there are lots of free stickers. i'm obsessed with this place.my airbnb host recommended this to me and i am a huge fan! really good coffee and a perfect place to just sit and work. loved it.i love this place. one of my favorite places in chicago and on earth.they've got a delorean, how else could it be better than this?super fun space to relax. i feel like i'm in a time warp, sitting in someone's living room enjoying a coffee. really like the vibe in here and the "artifacts" add to the experience.  so glad i stopped by while traveling through chicago and wicker park.this place is so interesting. it's an eclectic mix of ghostbusters, e.t., teenage mutant ninja turtles, old macs, nintendo...i mean. it was almost like stepping back in time! well, stepping back in time to a really fun, friendly coffee shop with super creative drinks and really friendly staff.after perusing the menu, i opted for the "cool but not rude" - a ginger and curry powder latte. the curry powder was not at all overpowering and actually paired really well with the ginger. it almost tasted like a chai, but slightly more savory in a really good way!there's lots of seating all around and free wi-fi (for which you get the login info off of floppy disks!!). i only spent an hour here, but wish i had more time because i think i could really hang out and do work here!best coffee i've ever had, so much delicious foam and always beautifully served even in the to go cups! the koopatroopa is my absolute favorite and my boyfriend loves the honeybear. the place has a really cool vibe and watching the baristas make the crazy concoctions is entertaining in itself!one of my favorite place in chicago. the first coffe shop to must go. the delorean of back to the future also you can play old video games. coffee extraordinary. black tea great toothis is a nostalgic person's paradise and it'll take you back in time to when you had big hair, bad fashion sense and all the best entertainment that has ever existed...hence, the wormhole.  let's go back in time together to enjoy the simple pleasures of yester-year when life wasn't so difficult.  walking into this fantastic little coffee shop sort of did make the worries of my day wash away because of how encompassing all the familiar games and doo-dad's were.  it took a couple of minutes for me to keep my eyes from wandering off to all corners of the coffee shop so that i could focus on what i wanted to order from their awesome menu.i say the menu is awesome because it was - they offered all the usual things such as coffee, lattes, cold brew coffee and so on and so forth, but what really caught my eye was the the board filled with specialty drinks.  come to mama!  i love my specialty drinks and although i was contemplating the idea of ordering one for here and one to go, i simply settled on the koopa-troopa latte (aka peanut butter latte).  i've been desperately awaiting the time that my travels brought me to this neck of the wood so that i could get my hands on one of these lattes, and finally it was mine!  it was utterly delightful!  i have never tasted any one thing just like this - the wormhole definitely gets 5 stars for uniqueness.  i'd come into the wormhole expecting to get this drink, but i was almost swayed by the other drinks on the board.  in spirit of the 80's theme, let me just say "i'll be back" (cue arnold schwarzenegger voice).  i am going to get my hands on some more of those drinks - they just looked and sounded too good to not be drunk.  what is even more superb is that they have a punch card for those frequent flyers who do plan on coming back for more!  it works just the same as any other punch card where you buy 10 drinks and get the 11th one for free.  yes, you'll have to spend about $50 on drinks (oh my gosh, that's a lot when you put it that way) to get to that point, but it'll be easy sippin'...especially if you can play some pacman while doing so.  yes, seriously...they have old-school games to play while slurping coffee.  i didn't take advantage of this when i was here, but i will.  oh, yes i will.  i almost forgot to the mention that they have yummy baked goods that i didn't try, but again..."i'll be back" to try those too.by the way, there is a lot of seating in the wormhole and there are plenty of outlets as well.  it's the perfect place to do work with a break for some fun in between.  the seating is extremely comfortable and like me, it might just make you a teeny tiny bit unmotivated to go back to work.  the only thing that maybe would have had my butt moving was the fact that i couldn't listen to one more queen song.  no disrespect to queen or the other 80's music, but i can only take that in small doses.  the wormhole, though...well i will take that in a couple large doses.  please and thank you.the honey bear latte was great! but i guess i wasn't white enough to have a proper answer for milk options. lolthis coffee shop is super unique! i came here after a meeting i had in wicker and decided to try out one of their specialty lattes - something with activated charcoal and oat milk! the prices were pretty reasonable and the latte was pretty good, too. this place is super busy all the time from the looks of it but does have a lot of different areas for people to work in - get there early!great, little coffeehouse with gritty, 80s character. so nice to sit down for a properly-sized cortado in a shop not adorned with industrial metal and fake decorative grasses. recommended.if you are a woman of a certain age, or just straight up cool, you will want to spend some time here, either admiring the delorean and gizmo's portrait, or relaxing with a perfect iced tea.luckily, on my visit to wicker park, i did both that humid august day. wish more coffee shops  had as much character (love the nostalgia factor for all us children of the 80's. makes me want to re-watch my transformers and jem episodes. admit you want to, too).it's a great place to chill out or bring ur books and laptops. flavored coffee is little bit too sweet. maybe it's just my own taste. i like my coffee sugar free. but still it's a great place to visit and will come again!coolest place in chicago! great seasonal/speciality drinks, great meeting friends/working place. fits in hip ol wicker park and lives up to its cool punk ambianceit was a slow sunday morning and i needed a caffeine boost. i am glad i came here on sunday before i decided to venture out to the suburbs. i stepped inside and it quickly reminded me of my childhood. ah the memories of growing up in the 90s. anyway, i got the koopa troopa and i was in another universe. this coffee shop is so awesome and i will definitely come back to try the honey bear latte.this is one of my favorite local coffee shop. on our off day from work, my husband and i enjoyed for a good cup of coffee, it's 15 minutes drive from our house and we are not hesitate for the drive. it's because of the goodness from koopa-troopa and vanilla bean, just made our heart content. i mean who say no to the good coffee, let alone the atmosphere is friendly and retro style decor style not to mention the staff are nice too. the music background really gives you the hype to start your day with a good energy. i would bring all my visitors to come here at least once.i love the vibe in here. the decor is so retro and perfect. i just wish there was a little more variety for food. i could have used a sandwich when i visited at 5 pm. but other than that, it was really great, and i'll be back for sure.this coffee is fantastic.  you will taste the difference with the very first sip.  it is so delicious you don't even need to dress it up with heavy creams or lots of syrup. the decor and vibe are one-of-a-kind, but the coffee is the thing that will bring you back.awesome 80s themed cafe! friendly staff! unique lattes, i got the cool but rude latte (ginger and curry)i felt so at peace with inner 90's kid at this nerdtastic independent little coffee shop in wicker park. seriously, come inside and check out the delorean on display as well as all the other pop culture fare from 80s and 90s past scattered throughout. i stayed here for hours on my laptop on one of their comfy couches, and had the chance to try their iced chai tea latte and some coffee. service is awesome, i was greeted right away! there are plenty of outlets throughout the store as well so you can come and stay for awhile. and the music, oh the music! i didn't even have to put my headphones on because they were playing the entire frank ocean channel orange album as well as some other soulful stuff during my visit. the restrooms are also all gender friendly which is soooo 2017 and progressive af. i think i've definitely found my new favorite coffee spot in my new city as i'm an anti-basic becky starbucks girl and ain't sorry about it.pretty interesting place! it's an 80s themed coffee place. ample seating but is usually crowded. drinks are good, recommend the honey bear iced. good place to get work done.love this place!great coffee, superb lattes, and the bakedgoodies are delish!  clean and inviting a place where a coffee (or tea!) lover feelswelcome to work or chat with friends.have since moved their delorean from the front to the back of the place...yes, the real deal!  love the vibe here.  check it out...weekends here can be crazy, but that tells you something, doesn't it?!peanut butter + chocolate was a match made in heaven and the koopa troopa is the officiator. love this place, super retro vibes w the delorean and all. the crowds and the caffeine kinda put me into sensory overload, so not a great study space, but yah you do you boo boo.awesome decor. there are many authentic retro posters that are beat to see and the delorian is worth seeing. coffee was good but personally not my taste. and the pastries or the one i had was not good. if your going though to work on your computer and chill it's the perfect spotsuper cute, super hipster. everything about this place is perfect. the service is great, the employees are very sweet and the coffee/beverages are amazing. i had the chai and i definitely recommend it. this area is also very cute and i advise walking along this street, it has a lot of shops and places to eat as well.there are four non-chain spots for coffee in the heart of wicker park on milwaukee avenue. bru is just too expensive and a little too snotty. filter is hatefully run by hipster assholes. and while intelligensia is cool, they're a little too far off the beaten path for this silly comparison.but wormhole gets it right, treats you right, and provides hands down the best sit-in experience of the three... and that's without factoring in all the cool retro design features of the cafe itself (from the delorean overlooking the cafe, to the theme of the menu, to the 80's/90's trinkets scattered around the cafe). as you'd expect at a good and popular place, seating can be limited and it may take a bit of time to get your drink during busy hours. but if you can sit down, it's a great place to hang out or work on some stuff.i'm sure you can find 30 places that serve better quality coffee if you really wanted to. but if you just want a decent espresso drink or cup of coffee, and a decent place to chill out for a bit, wormhole is the no-doubt place to go in wicker park.hands down one of my favorite places to grab a cup of coffee in chicago.  if you are an 80's kid and love movies you need to make it a point to stop in. the first thing i noticed was the delorean affixed to a raised platform in the back of the cafe!  huge huge huuuuuge fan of back to the future so naturally i thought this was awesome.  the place is covered in nostalgia.  from movie posters, to ninja turtles and star wars toys, to good ol plastic and tin lunchboxes!  the wormhole will take you on a trip down memory lane.  speaking of trips, your tastebuds are in for one too!  the coffee is awesome.  always hot (or cold if you choose) and made fresh to order.  my go to is the cool but rude: a latte with ginger and curry.  i have been know  to buy two of these they are so flippin good!!!  i've had others but this is my go to, i don't think ive ordered anything since ive had this . . .the pastries are great as well.  homemade pop tarts are a must try.  there is ample seating but be sure to get there early as it does fill up quickly.  oh and to top it off, they have a nes and games on an old school tv!!! i mean come on . . . if i didn't have to adult on a daily basis id probably come her for breakfast and just lounge on the couch and spend the day playing nintendo.  i will always make it a point to stop in to wormhole when im in chi town . . . . you should too!!!i came here to see the delorean and the 80s decor.  also i was looking forward to trying the vanilla bean latte.  both were great. latte was perfect and the shop itself is awesome.  only issue i had was with the pricing $5 for the latte is a bit pricey, however it's worth it for the experience!great music. great coffee. great service. great interior with game/anime theme. great retro 80's/90's vibes. great selection of oldschool nintendo games. but all this (usually) comes with a long queue - both for coffee and bathroom!tip: the wifi info is on the floppy disk - how hip is that.i tried the peanut butter and chocolate (i think?) coffee and it was too weird for me. it honestly did not taste good. however, that was my first time there and i'd be happy to update my review when i get a chance to go back. it's a funky 80s themed place and i would definitely meet there with a friend or to study, but my tastebuds are pushing me to give this a 3-star today.wormhole is just...awesome. if you loved the 80s and 90s, you're in explicit heaven. you'll find everything from an apple 2e that sometimes has the wifi password on the side, to a delorean from back to the future, to legend of zelda/mario themed drinks, to yoda, thundercats, alf, ghostbusters, tmnt, and even the light up finger et. b! beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. you can tell what i remember the most of my childhood.they have some unique takes on coffees with honey and pb and all sorts of things like that, which i think most people would coincidentally enjoy. our group tried and shared a bunch of drinks and were extremely satisfied with the result.then we have the only problem - this place is too popular for their own good. it's impossible to find seating, the lines are out the door, and good luck getting to the bathroom. however, that doesn't mean the place isn't awesome - it is.1462 n milwaukee ave (wicker park) when i visited : 2.27.17what i got: koopa troopa latte (12oz)[slip space rupture detetected] hello future! yes the coffee passport is missing in action like luke skywalker in star wars vii, and the political scene may seem to be the darkest time line now. however, after an already awful week bled into a working weekend, i found myself scheduled to work late shift at work. thus i warped in wicker park on late into a monday morning and finally went to wormhole, and wound up writing. the cafe itself lends a generous nod to late 80s/early 90s pop culture. an iconic  metal delorean body rests above its back wall and various artwork adorns the walls of a similar themes. various potted plants (mostly desert type) are found spread throughout the cafe, breathe further life and calm into the patrons passing through wormhole. the lighting inside manages to balance a calming, dimming nature as the more long staying patrons may retreat further into wormhole. this darker progression blends well with the natural light which indirectly cast through the large front windows facing southeast toward toward milwaukee ave. seating options offer up the usual low bar window seats, tables and chairs, and a select few comfy couches and chairs in the back.  as for the drinks themselves, wormhole offers bean based beverages from halfwit roasters. their geeky/alternative aesthetic continues to provide inspiration behind their specialty lattes. i ordered up the koopa troopa which was touted as a dark chocolate latte with a  peanut butter mousse. these flavor notes came through, and with them they also brought undertones of toffee and specculous for strong sweet taste that satisfied but managed not to overpower for fizzle out as many hyper sweet frappuccino style drinks tend to do these days. beyond flavor alone, the latte was well made with an admirably accessible temperature and partially blended foam on top that showcased the advertised mousse up top but also allowed it to bleed through over time and contribute a pleasant nuttiness to the rest of the drink below.  with so many good coffee offerings in this neighborhood, it's hard to honestly attempt to give them all a fair shot. despite this and my distance to the spot (being in roger's park)  wormhole is certainly worth initiating your hyper drive for and making the trip out. overall rating : 9/10the best for a reason! had the cold brew. delicious on a hot summer day and the atmosphere is solid and the decorations, priceless. great stickers and everything on the menu looked great! only negative is the super crowded venue where everyone is staring at their computers.the wormhole manages to be that rare spot that is good for both studying quietly and chatting with friends.  also, there's a delorean.  and a ninja turtle.  and a lot of vintage toys, lunchboxes, mugs, and other nostalgia-inducing nerd objects and art displayed in a surprisingly tasteful manner.  my favorite are the italian star wars posters.  moving on from the decor, seating options are mainly small couches, chairs, stools, and shared tables.  everywhere i've sat has been comfortable, though we're usually trying to cram an extra person or two into a smallish space since it's a popular spot.  there's a decent selection of tea here, and the staff know how to steep it properly, green at a lower temperature.  you'll get a cup of tea and if it's resteepable, you'll get a steeper cup of the leaves to bring back up for refills.  my friends seem happy with the coffee. bathrooms are gender-neutral single-seaters.  there are no changing tables.   i'm knocking a point off for not having more allergy-friendly snacks, but generally i love this place.stopped in on new years day, and i'm sure they were one of the few independent coffee shops open in the area during the day, but their service was particularly slow. even with three baristas bouncing between taking orders and making drinks, they still seemed to spend more time chatting than getting orders out from the counter...that being said the cappuccino i ordered was great. nice and smooth. price was right and the atmosphere is fun, 80's arcade game style. i'd come back if i was in the area.excellent coffee with some unique specials that defy the imagination.  cool atmosphere.  outdoor seating.  clean bathrooms.i stopped by here one night and enjoyed a nice small chai latte. the vibe of the coffee shop was  pretty hip and there were lots of cool retro details. there was plenty of space to accommodate for those who were looking for more of a sit-down space to get some work done; however, i opted for a cup to-go. the chai latte was nicely made and i even got to see a nice design on it even though the size i got was pretty small. the latte itself wasn't overly sweet, which i enjoyed greatly. the nice, hot drink was just what i needed on a cold winter night. i will be back in the future to try the other drinks on the menu!dream come true. this place is magical. for the fan of 1980's & coffee this is your haven. the delorean is the closest i'll get to having a real one and just being surrounded by people and items that represent how much i love these films makes me happy. my dog is named marty after mcfly and my favorite band is mcfly. this place is meant to be. fantastic muffins. perfect lattes. large cafe. cute bar stool seating and other comfy seating throughout. wish i lived down the street. i would be here every day .first time here. their business card is a picture of a nintendo remote control. cute. drinking an americano coffee (their strongest) with a chocolate chip pastry (delicious). yummy combo.get the vanilla latte. it's the most popular and it's the best. i love doing freelance work here or meeting up with friends. good vibes. cool people. great place to get some work done.this place has the best locally roasted coffee, the nicest baristas, and the best place to sit and relax or do work in. the koopa troopa is always my favorite and consistently tasty and the decor does not disappoint. the delorean on the far wall is so awesome.this place is pretty cool! they have the back to the future delorean in the back of the cafe. how awesome is that???? and lots of other back to the future nick nacks, like bumper stickers that have movie lines. "you are my density" is one of my favs.the weekends get very busy, so if you want to get a good spot, go early or wait.my friend and i both ordered tea, and what's great is that if you get it for "here", they'll have it in this great tea strainer. and after you're done with your first cup, you can get a refill of hot water for a second strain. more for your money! i always love getting more for your money ;)need quick transport to the 80's!the aptly named wormhole does the trick--not so subliminal décor drives the decade to you.  the delorean raised near the ceiling is remarkable.had a latte which was very good.for those who are intrigued with the artistry of the barista (how dare you!?!), get the cocoa--the rich brown is a perfect contrast with the creamy top to create quite an aesthetic.   i had a sip of the drink, rich with cocoa, but it's more sweet than i'd prefer for myself.  the recipient felt it was good, not great.adorable 90s themed cafe. i'm so glad i stopped by during my weekend in chicago. i loved every bit of it. they had a working nintendo game console from the 90s! it was awesome! lots of toys, books, decor, etc. from the 90s. nostalgia at its finest. wish we had one of these back in california.there is plenty of seating. it's a great place to study or chat with friends. their menu is pretty unique. i got the crucial taunt (earl grey, lemon, cayenne) and it was definitely interesting. it was a balance between: mmm-this-is-surprisingly-good and this-is...-interesting. i probably wouldn't get it again, but it was worth trying. by the way, they sell aeropresses here. i got one for my boyfriend for christmas last year and he loves it. i recommend getting one for any coffee lovers.this place was recommended by a good friend who is from the area and their recommendation was on point. i came on thursday afternoon and it was super chill finding a place to sit. also the setting is great with the variety of nerd things you will see from the calvin and hobbes canvas to the stain glass classic nintendo remote. also the drink menu was fitting for the theme as well. i got a vanilla latte and it was legit. it a calming place to be in as well as the customer services with the baristas. no complaints, i would recommend coming to this coffee shop for studying, hanging out, or just to get me time.were i a local this would definitely be my go-to coffee joint. should be no surprise there since i asked someone that worked in one of my favorite shops in the neighborhood what the best coffee shop was in the area and without hesitation he suggested the wormhole. great strong iced coffee at a decent price. good music but not too loud, colorful staff and clientele and a mishmash of vintage decor to furnish the place. plenty of outlets to charge up your various electronic devices whether doing so at a desk or sinking into a big ol' comfy couch. bathrooms were pleasantly clean as well. all of the things i look for in a good cafe were present and accounted for.this is a great place to do some work or studying. there are plenty of outlets and the noise level is definitely manageable. their drinks are good and very reasonably priced. the staff is super friendly, and the atmosphere is definitely chill with their interesting decor. there are different seating arraignments so you can either lay back with a book on the couches, grab a bar seat and work alone, or sit at a table and duke it out with group members.cool little spot with pretty solid coffee. the delorean caught my eye from the street so i knew i had to stop in. really cozy feel inside, never felt cramped. service was really great and prompt. beats many of the shops in the surrounding area.really liked the nerdy decor of this coffeeshop and how you can bring a laptop to spend the afternoon there chilling. the space is a bit limited on the weekend thoughthe coffee is good, we got the "cool but rude" one with a bit of a curry aftertastethe coffee is fantastic. my cousin who i've come here with says it's a bit overrated, but he's a barista and coffee snob. i honestly don't care too much as long as it isn't full of sugar or burnt. the effort they put into the coffee is evident and you won't be dissappointed.the business itself is great. the staff is of course hip and a bit quirky, but they are still very friendly and don't come off as snobbish. there are a lot of nerdy fancy coffee places popping up trying to cash in on the tech-startup fueled craze. this is place is one of them, but it doesn't seem too forced. the atmosphere is just different. there are plenty of people in there writing their third novel on their macbook, but there also several dressed down locals obviously just chilling before starting their days. drop by if you are in the area and then maybe grab a selfie with the delorean. you will have fun.okay so i'm going to gush a little - their decor is geek inspired with lots of pop culture memorabilia from the 80s and 90s. there's an old tv set with a nes and a delorean towards the back. i love their rotating list of specialty drinks and it's a great place to pop in your headphones while working.i haven't talked about the coffee because it's the crown jewel of wormhole. the coffeeshop roasts their own coffee in the basement under their halfwit brand, which was incubated internally by former wormhole staff. their moonbat blend is the best for making cold brew at home. and what's more is that through halfwit, wormhole also offers barista training and development for other coffeeshops around the city.very inclusive, very community-oriented, local coffee roasters themselves. the only "bad" thing is they get very busy at peak hours.we live very close to wormhole. went in every day. the cashier told us we get a "10% neighborhood discount since we live in the neighborhood."  one morning, my wife mentioned it and the rude lady told her "you can't use that, it's only for people who work in the neighborhood."  so now, pettiness over a 50 cent discount on mochas, keep us from coming back. all the cutesy, kitschy, 80's stuff doesn't make up for rude customer service.how i wish wormhole was closer to where i live, so i could visit regularly!wormhole is situated on a busy stretch of milwaukee, and you have to know where it's located, as the entrance is relatively unassuming.  the interior is a little grungy, but who cares?  the coffee and specialty drinks are worth it!  wormhole offers your familiar espresso fare, but amps it up with drinks like the peanut butter koopa troopa (mocha) and honey bear latte (with local honey).last note: this place has "ny sizing", where small is 8oz.  so the drink's a splurge, but you're worth it!i stayed home last night and burped the old ladies wormhole and man was that worth a 5 star review!!!! yeeeeee haaaaaaaw!!!!!!!!in the heart of busy busy wicker park and it reflected inside.  the coffee shop is ecclectic with hipster-friendly decor all over including the back to the future car in the back and gizmo wall painting. i came here because i needed to get out of the house and do some work so i was looking for a place that was spacious and had wifi/plugs.  there's definitely a lot of seating (tables and couches) but it was so packed the whole day i'm surprised we found seating near outlets.  they play popular hit songs so i kept thinking i was in a bar - and definitely wanted to go to one afterwards!  i got a chai latte which was good but came out lukewarm. this place is cool but i wasn't a fan of it being soo jammed packed, pretty loud (from all the people and workers dropping stuff), and the drinks were kind of mediocre compared to the surrounding coffee shops in chicago.  maybe i'll come back.  wifi was solid.cute themed cafe to hang out in. the staff are friendly and the place has tables and couches for studying. the place is usually busy so it might be difficult to find seating. lots of plugs near the tables to charge up any electronics along with free wifi (password is on little cards on the tables). ordered an earl grey tea - they give you the tea leaves from the first steep and when you finish your first cup you can go back and get it steeped again for free. any kind of milk toppers are extra $0.50 (and if you want another milk topper for the second steep it's another $0.50). standard tea - nothing special or amazing about the tea, but it was served quite hot. menu selection seems like the standard coffee shop with some snacks. i don't drink coffee, so i noted that selection was limited to non-coffee drinkers (ie: no non coffee based/matcha lattes or tea lattes).one down side is i prefer to study with illumination, and despite being in the cafe in the afternoon it was quite dark. also, since it's so busy it might be a little noisy to get work done (so bring headphones). as such, i wouldn't really recommend this place to get some work done. if i were to return, i would probably return to hang out with friends opposed to studying.music was loud, people doing their own thing, mostly hipster folks on their laptops which helped me and my wife focus and get some work done.came here with a friend based on the raving yelp reviews. we both ordered caffè mocha and asked for cocoa powder on the surface. i double asked the barista about the latter. he said you got it. all the artistic coffee shops i have been to, make the mocha with espresso, milk and chocolate (and/or cocoa powder). when our mocha came, there was no chocolate or cocoa neither inside or on the surface. it was cold and the taste was more like a latte and bland like old coffee. while drinking that disappointment, my friend and i were checking out some cool star wars and gremlins toys in front us. the interior decor is from the 1980's basically and it's so hipster and interestingly geeky. while discussing if one of the gremlin toys looks like yoda, the barista took that gremlin toy and put it somewhere else like we were about to steal it or something! no sense of humor or a friendly face!. we could not comment anything on that cup of coffee with a unwelcoming face like that. wormhole wouldn't stand a chance if it was for the coffee. the best thing about them is the location and the interior decor. for the coffee quality, would give less than 2 stars, for the cool vintage hipster design 4 stars and for the service that night 1 stars. maybe we came on a very bad evening for that barista.can't believe i have just been walking by this place for 3 years! definitely stop in if you haven't yet. the vibe is cool, and these baristas definitely know how to make a latte!awesome vibe...vintage throwback decor... delicious made to order drinks as well as some unique signature concoctions you won't find anywhere else.great place. great food, atmosphere, and coffee. i love it because it spontaneous with old school movie poster and back to the future car. i came here with my boyfriend, well this is his college hiding alot to do work. so it a great place in the morning to come. the banana nut bread is food and the hot coffee and cold brew is delicious. well be coming back just to read a book or to do some homework. go visit, you won't regret it.overall, the wormhole is a cozy coffee shop to bring friends, family, dates, or to go solo and read a book. this cafe can definitely serve as an off-the-grid study spot. lastly, they are open from 7am-11pm every day of the week pouring locally roasted coffee and serving an assortment of desserts including some vegan donuts.today, october 21, 2015, i walked into the cafe 80s. i ordered a pepsi perfect and taught some kids how to play a game "using their hands." then this dude came in with his crew (pretty sure he had a few short circuits in his bionic implants) and we got into a tussle that ended up outside. i had to borrow some poor girl's hoverboard and tried to get away but those boards don't work on water! i won't bore you with the details of the rest of my day but it was pretty crazy.wormhole might as well be called cafe 80s with its homage to all things 80s, and of course that amazing delorean. i love coming in here and getting all nostalgic about my childhood. oh yeah, and they have great coffee too. but they need more fax machines.it was my first time going into the city to have a study session and i decided to check out the wormhole. i am really glad i did because it was an awesome place to study and i ran into an old friend here.i arrived around 3 pm on labor day 2014 and it was pretty packed but there were still a few empty spots to grab a seat.i ordered a vanilla latte 8 oz for $4. i sat down at one of the sofa while i waited for my cup of joe to come out. about 5 minutes later, my name was called and i picked it up and also got the wifi password from the floppy disk at the front of the store.i migrated to the bar area where the baristas were making their coffee. the seating here was a bit uncomfy, especially for a short person because the stools were so tall that but my feet were dangling and there was no back rest to the stool. my back started hurting from hunching and i kept getting distracted because i was admiring the skills of the baristas making the drinks. and not to mention, it is a bit loud. about an hour after, i migrated to the table that is shared by 6 people. it is a bit crowded but enough elbow room for all of us to be on our laptop. this is where the outlets are too for people who need to charge their phones/laptops. this was where i got most of my work done.overall, i really like the theme of this coffee shop. it has a video game theme on top of the 80s music they kept playing. i loved it! the coffee was delicious, too and very reasonably priced!i would definitely come back to study here or catch up with a friend. they have a lot of cool stuff around the store that i wanna check out next time i come back, like the old school video game console, the small section of quirky gift ideas, and the cool car in the back of the store.i'm a starbucks barista but your vanilla bean lattes bring comfort an pure yummy bliss to my mornings:))))delicious lattes - i had the honey bear and my fiancé had the vanilla - both were outstanding. however, the girl taking our order seemed to be having a bad day and was not friendly at all. seemed to be inconvenienced by us ordering coffee and asking questions.this coffee shop is so cool !!they have random stuff from 90s and 80s . the place has really great coffee ! i got a iced latte and it was so good !  i really like the place for getting work done . it's is a little busy but people seem to be respectable of you if  are reading .great coffee! been here several times and the quality has been great all the time, if you are lucky you will find a seat during the busy hours, in the morning there's seating available most of the times. last time i was there i had a cortado, which they serve you with like a small cookie which is cool to balance out the richness of the coffee. i also recommend their cold brew now that summer is coming up. i've tried their lattes before and they on point. good atmosphere.luckily enough to come across this spot on my trip to chicago.  great ambiance, plenty of seating for working, and amazing coffee!  i had the honey bear latte and loved it!  it may have been a special so no promises it will still be there!  i have a feeling though that this is one of the places where you can't go wrong.the one thing i'll say is that food is limited to pastries.  there are no sandwiches.  but i guess that's typical in town for coffee shops not to have kitchens.  different than boston.  who knew!check it out.hands down best coffee i have had in a very long time. this place screams 80's and hipsters, but still has that local neighborhood feel even with its growing popularity. and rightfully so. any place that brews their own coffee that they grind, then make individually and also sell fresh on site is worth my time. i had the vanilla bean latte which was seriously amazing if not life changing. if i moved to chicago i would live off damen so i could be close to here. this is seriously how i want to start my day everyday.the ambiance is very mixed of locals, business people, students, hipsters, 80's kids and the like. come early or wait for the line to go away like i did, because we got the couches in the front and didn't even wait for our coffee. we also bought t shirts for this place because not only were they awesome but also on recycled materials. how can you not love that?if you are a tmnt fan, bttf fan or love 80's this place will knock your socks off. i will let that be the surprise! the decor is awesome to photograph or just be around if you can find a seat. for a place so small, they do fit a lot of people sitting so if you hangout you can probably get a seat. overall absolutely loved this place, the quality, the prices were fair, decor was awesome, staff was amusing and ambiance is worth the trip. went all during my vacation to chicago and will be back!my new favorite coffee shop. came here to get some studying and work done and was the perfect place. got a very vanilla bean iced offee was awesome! place has wifi and ton of super comfortable couches and lounges chairs and some outdoor tables and a small sit up bar. lots of 80s nostalgia and even a delorean in back. food was lacking, only some donuts. but came for a awesome coffee and a place to hangout and get some work done. will def be coming back soon. was just busy enough. so as not to be bothered.along with the original he-man castle, apple mac, and other 80s paraphernalia that rocks this house, the tea here (green) was yum.bruuuuh i'm in tha bedroom of a teenager frum da ninetiezzz. wuuuuuut. fr worf a trip jus fo tha vibes. choose coffee shop company well cuz i brought dis fool who trynna talk nonsense n i'm jus trynna type. bruh

i can't stand dem childrin. holla atchyo gurl.i stumbled upon this shop on a cold january day and found myself in heaven. absolutely love this place, my go to study spot in wicker park. the peanut butter koopa troopa is a winner here, even for a non-coffee lover like myself.the best part is the environment: so many awesome nerdy things! back to the future delorean sits above you and star wars posters everywhere. great place to watch hipsters and students thrive in their element. this place gets crowded quickly so if you wanted a nice spot on the couch, better come early!what a quirky little place. it's like i stepped into a time machine powered by a flux capacitor and went back to 1985. errrrythang is 80's here. a back to the future delorean is up above, a nintendo system so that i can whip some butt in blades of steel, metal lunchboxes line the wall, and an old fossil - like mac computer sits for our viewing pleasure. unlike filter where i go to relax and get work done on my computer and yelp my behind off. here i come to play. play video games all while being visually stimulated by 80's relics. now my drink would be the supa dupa peanut butter koopa troopa for people who are supa dupa fly like me. it's a peanut buttery mocha like drink that's quite delicious. add to that some cereal, say what? that's rite for a $1.50 i can get a bowl of apple jacks (other cereals are available) that will yummy my tummy! milk and cereal, milk cereal, cereal and milk, cereal and milkto sum this place up. it's a playground that assaults the senses with 80's memorabilia,  endless nintendo playing, supa doopa peanut buttery coffee drinks, cheap cereal and if you stay till closing you can usually get some free pastries. come check it out with your homies, video games and cereal, you will feel like your back in college.their rocket sauce - yerba mate with some fruit and kick is really good spacious good vibes all aroundi have always loved wormhole since the first time i set foot in it about a year ago! they're open late, have great coffee and tea, and that atmosphere is so fun and quirky. they've got comfy couches and chairs. the staff is efficient and welcoming. it's a great late night study spot. i would recommend giving it a shot. personal favorite drink: honey bear latte!best coffee shop i've been to. plus they have a delorean so you can stay there forever!great spot overall, great location, great vibe and good coffee options. really like the seating and reliable wi-fi.however, slightly snobby staff (some of them) that talk down at you like rebelling high schoolers, (eye rolls, blank looks if you don't know the options). came here once and one girl was outright belligerent for me asking her about the menu.their teas are a solid buck pricier than other coffee shops, and they tell you they can't just give you some hot water to re-steep a pot you already have in front of you with tea you already bought, because of course pay for another you cheap-o! (comes with another eye roll).other than that, really enjoy coming here.delorean in the back, wifi password on a floppy disk, light music, nes system to play, what's not to like? coming from austin, the wormhole became my go-to coffee shop, making me feel right at home. what makes it feel like austin? no, it's not the hipsters, or the weirdos that frequent the place, but it's the general inviting environment. it's a coffee shop that makes you want to stay, rather than get your coffee and gtfo.if you like peanut butter, get the koopa troopa.this coffee shop epitomizes wicker park. the place with all of your childhood favorites; old school plastic lunchboxes line the top shelves, 90's movie posters line the walls, and there's a whole shelf filled with board games in the far corner. the kicker, however, is the full-model replica of the delorean from back to the future and the old tv hooked up to a nes system that's playable! the vibe is really chill, with people meeting for coffee or working on their laptops. the only downside is that space is limited and fills up fast, so if you're coming to work, have a back up plan just in case. i had the peppermint rooibos tea and a regular coffee, both which were delicious!by far my favorite coffeeshop in chi because... halfwit coffee.i first heard about wormhole from a barista @ gaslight coffee roasters in logan square. don't tell anyone, but i got a decaf coffee there and loved it. came to find out that they actually get it from here and wormhole brews up halfwit. seriously, it's a mean cup of decaf. if one has to drink decaf, it should be this one. when i finally made it over to wicker park, i figured i'd try something new and pick up a bag of the 'moonbat blend.' i split the bag w/ my brother; kind of wish i didn't. i did a medium grind and cold-brewed  for 12+ hours at home. dude, best cold-brew ever. flavor is rich and full-bodied. tastes good as a traditional french press as well. if you're in town, you'd be a fool to pass this up. head down to wormhole in wicker park and pick up a bag of halfwit coffee! it's the best.as far as the coffeeshop experience, two thumbs up. the place is decorated with cool nerdastic gear: old video games, a macintosh, and star wars collectibles. they have bar seating with plenty of natural light--nice view of milwaukee for people watching--outdoor seating and some couches/chairs indoors. they have a pretty creative drink menu other than the standard lattes and macchiatos. i'm guessing it changes from time to time. my friend & i picked up a honey bear latte & a 'cool but rude' ginger/curry latte. it was the business. 'spicy' but not played out like a chai. nice & creamy microfoam. generally, i have to ask places to cut out the sweetness but here i don't have to. they get that sugar is not a main flavor component in their crafted beverages.great nostalgic place with their decor. they have a delorian raised up in the back. my cold brew coffee was great and only $3 even.i'm a caffeine addict all the way from california, and all i can say is wow--wormhole cafe, you guys are the bomb.i have this little thing where i try to order a regular cappuccino from as many cafes as possible from wherever i travel to. so far i've maintained this tradition in san francisco, sacramento, new york, los angeles, chicago, and san diego, and i can still confidently say that wormhole stays high on my list of favorites. first off, the cafe decor is absolutely unique. i can't believe that they have one of those old dinosaur-aged apple mac computers! the cute little cafe keeps things interesting while you're waiting for your drink.like all my favorite cafes, the wormhole also has a variety of vegan pastries. during my first visit i had their cinnamon roll, which was delicious. the second time i came, they were closing so all pastries were free. free. free food. the baristas were all super chill, polite, and patient, and encouraged us to take whatever we wanted. i literally died and came back to life on vegan pastry island. i was so happy. and i didn't even get to the coffee yet, which i'm sure you can tell by now was phenomenal. i like my coffee strong, and the baristas definitely attended to that. i did order a small however, which i felt was a bit smaller than other cappuccinos i've ordered, but it was worth it. oh wormhole, why do you have to be 2,000 miles away from me? i would totally be a regular! :'(this place is super cool! the interior is decked out with 80's arcade and gaming memorabilia and there is a delorian casually parked inside as well. the coffee was the show stopper though, yeh brew there was fantastic and the baristas incredibly experienced. not to mention i got to play super nintendo whilst drinking it! two thumbs up!situated in the middle of wicker park, wormhole is the coffee shop to study at. the vibe and ambiance is great- perfect for knocking out a paper or any other work you may have. this place isn't super big, but there's enough seating if you get here earlier in the day, and sofas in the back. my go to order here is their mocha- rich, smooth, and overall pretty tasty. the drip coffee is good too if you prefer that over an espresso drink! the music can be a little loud at times but usually it's not a problem. i've never had a problem with a wifi here so that's a plus! hipster friendly, comfy and cozy seating- come out here especially on a dreary rainy day and you'll never want to leave!didn't have a good experience with the staff. the manager who allegedly called me many times to pick up my refill, felt it was necessary to shout my order and punctuate each word by pounding the tabletop. i felt humiliated, as i was engaged in a business meeting.cute and quirky at the same time! this place will bring you back in time, right back into the 80s! it features all sorts of 80s memorabilia from the back to the future car to tmnt and gremlins all around the shop.i got the honey bear latte, which was one of their specials. they had interesting specials, one that was the peanut butter koopa troopa, and another that had curry in it! so cool. i was much too full after dinner, or else i would have tried the pb drink...the honey bear latte was great, but a little too strong in honey flavor for my liking.this time machine shop was filled with hipsters typing away at 10pm still, and was a full house! i loved the free wifi (find it on the floppy disk) and the combination of tables, bar stools, and couches. choose to your heart's desire :)fun place, with shirts and coffee accessories to buy on the side too. overall, great atmosphere and working place. i'd love to be back!this place has the best latte i have ever tried in my entire life. i tried the koopa-troopa, a peanut butter chocolate latte. it had just the right amount of sweetness while still being able to taste the espresso. i went into the coffee shop around 9 pm on a thursday and there was plenty of parking on milwaukee. there was also a lot of tables with lamps for studying.the kids w/ ironic facial hair may pat themselves on their backs for the real time 80s irony of this place, but the real irony is luring the 40+ year olds inside who will not hesitate to drop the $4+ on a caffeinated beverage to look around and fondly reminisce about their 80s youth without the stain of the bad hair bands (both the scrunchie and "music").note: if you are now criticizing my use of the word "irony" above, you merely prove my point.p.s. just drink the damn coffee, it's good (halfwit coffee roasters, yum!).the wormhole has become my go-to coffeeshop since moving to logan square. i usually go for the cold brew (definitely on the acidic side, if you're into that) and an iced vanilla latte when i want to splurge. i'm no coffee expert so i won't say anything about the espresso, but i do think the vanilla latte is deliciously creamy and appropriately sweetened.i really like their music choices - the baristas have eclectic tastes, ranging from drake (jumpman jumpman jumpman), to weezer, to 80s pop. if you're working, there aren't many outlets at the bar, and unless you get a table early, the seats closest to the outlets are already occupied. if you've got a long charging cable for your laptop, you might have to apologetically navigate around people to plug it in. the two (gender neutral) single user bathrooms are kept nice and clean. the lighting is a little dim - the windows do most of the work.coming here in the summer, i noticed the ac works really well, so those of you who get cold more easily might want to have a sweater on deck!great scott!! in a very hipster haight-ashbury kind of area on milwaukee is this coffeehouse time warp that takes the theme of time travel to another level. with a monolith tv console found in the back and a stack of nintendo games like paperboy and contra beckoning beneath an actual back to the future styled delorean (complete with upturned tires) the atmosphere preserves the warm fuzzy nostalgia of the 80s. the latte i had hit the spot on a chilly day and the baristas are pretty open and friendly. there is less pretentiousness here than other places. i took home a 12 oz of guatemala coffee beans from a local roaster, halfwit, which wasn't too bad brewed black. i figure i might have let the coffee sit too long before the pour which made it taste slightly bitter. but the venue is good for reading, studying, and informal meetings, one was being conducted at the time i was there. and of course zoning out for hours in front of an old school oak tv console trying to beat king koopa.super nice staff.  openly provide wifi for customers and support laptop work in the cafe (as a real cafe should do...unlike la colombe!).  and iced vanilla latte is delicious.  not too sweet!also, i love the cute retro coffee station desk in here.i just wanted a macchiato and double espresso to go and the counter guy refused. apparently it's "store policy" to not grant the customer what he wants. i was so annoyed at the pompousness of this place.it's not hard to find a great cup of coffee in the city, and i can get one with out the side of elitist attitude.this is the coolest coffee shop in chicago. i don't live close but occasionally will take a special trip out to sit and absorb the heavy hipster vibe. there's nothing about me that fits in but i strongly connect to the 80s nostalgia. the drip or chemex coffee is perfect. the staff always seems sweet and even gregarious. truly love this shop. if you are a visitor in chicago this is worth an uber.cozy atmosphere with great baristas. ive never experienced an excessive long wait for my coffee but the short wait it worth it. their imports are great & i had best cup of dang coffee i ever had in my life here !super cute cafe with great coffee and a very convivial vibe. not efficient for studying/working without headphones though.i love this place so much!!!! great place to hang on weekends. good service and delicious drinksthis place is extremely overrated! beware. the coffee is mediocre at best and the atmosphere is incredibly pretentious. also, why does their yelp page only have one dollar sign? in addition to the coffee being bland, it is way over priced. wormhole is one of these new aged wanna be fancy coffee places that at the end of the day is just not that great. a perfect place for hipsters and aspiring hipsters-dark all around. better coffee in wicker park is la colombe or honestly the mcdonald's off of western has better drip coffee.hopefully someone is saved from being scammed by wormhole from reading the reviews on this yelp page.immediate reaction after sipping: the space is hip with many things from my childhood that bring back fond memories, mocha was good and not too much chocolate taste which is good, and the hot chocolate was a pleasant surprise, nothing bad to say -so if you around go to see the delorean first name hipster last name hipster. we went and got a mocha and hot chocolate about an hour before they were closing i assume the staff was tired because they were not overly friendly. we grab a seat at the coffee bar and waited for drinks. when she saw were sitting across the bar and called our names for the drinks i still had to get up which was fine but didn't really make much sense we were right in front of here. i thought the mocho was ok nothing special the highlight was that that was not too much chocolate so that you can actually taste some of the espresso. my wife was really happy with the hot chocolate because they still did latte art on it which was a nice touch. i really like the gremlins artwork.through the glass door and down the rabbit wormhole we go. your destination is childhood nostalgia with a shot of caffeine. the wormhole coffee is armed with a flying delorean, a collection of metal lunch boxes, an original nes, and even calvin and hobbes comic books to pique your interest.people may think that all those items must be a gimmick and the java must be terrible, but they are incorrect! the wizards of the coffee bean have created life altering concoctions such as the drunken citrus mocha and the tim curry. the former is a booze infused mocha with a hint of citrus that is sure to make you giddy, as if you pounded back a few shots of tequila. the tim curry a combination espresso, milk, ice, and indian spices. it is as ridiculous as it sounds, but awesome like home alone 2.i visited on a friday afternoon it was pretty busy. my drink was delicious. i had a soy latte. they have copies of the new york times which also really pleases me. there is a good amount of space and seating but it's a popular place and people do stay for a while to work on their computers. i like the feel of the thick wooden counters. there is a delorean in there up on a giant shelf as a decoration. seriously. the service was very good and staff were very good at making drinks and they really seemed like my kind of people.  i'd like to note that they were all easy on the eyes too.  the volume of the music was just right. the music was alt pop. interesting yet easy to listen to.the vanilla bean latte is heaven. probably my favorite latte of all time..... i can't even describe to you how incredible it was you just have to come in and try it. they actually make a paste from the beans instead of using extract. hipster af but it's too good to be judgmental about.the coffee is great and the atmosphere is amazing! oh, and they have some good tea as well. the only thing that lacks is service. the baristas can be a little rude sometimes.the inside blends with the streets outside.coffee is the best i have had in this city. try the homemade vanilla and the honey latte.coolest coffee shop ever! walking into this place is like a blast from the past...old movie posters, the back to the future car displayed in the back, octopussy & nintendo game references. not to mention super comfy couches and chairs.i kept it simple and ordered their homemade vanilla bean latte but i was so tempted to try their peanut butter koopa troopa which looked and sounded heavenly. we all loved our lattes. you can tell they use high quality ingredients as i have never tasted such a delicious vanilla bean in my life.if you are in the area, definitely check this place out! it blows starbucks and carribou out of the water!this is a solid place.  quick and friendly service, plus a cute and quirky electro-retro vibe.  i had the iced chai latte, and while i think the person who said it was the "best in the world" might be exaggerating, it did hit the spot.  if you are in the area it is worth popping in here for some quick refreshment.wormhole is my happy place.the allure of wormhole is in its decor, which is dedicated to star wars, nintendo, and all things nerdy.  there is a back to the future style delorean in the back!  the place has a great ambiance to it- definitely a trendy style coffee place.  don't go with a group, because seats are hard to come by, and especially seats together. you can play mario cart and super mario brothers on the nintendo in the back.there are homemade pop-tarts and twinkes available, but those usually run out early in the day and you are left with meh muffins. no other food options.  the coffee menu is pretty minimalist, but of a good quality. they have really create latte creations (chocolate peanut butter, honeyed ginger!)so the problem i have with "hipster" coffee shops is that it's always crowded and loud. no matter what time it is here, there is always a ton of people stuffed in a small space. i also pretty much only ever go to coffee shops to do work so a place that's crowded and loud already slightly aggravates me. on top of it all, much of the seating is a) on sofa chairs - really difficult to write anything on a chair b) shared seating at a large table - ugh, for a person who prefers not to be crammed next to unknown, anonymous people, this is a nightmare and c) at the bar/against the wall stools - the depth of the table which is way too narrow. then on top of all that, apparently the last i checked, the only iced tea option was the scarlet iced tea which straight up tastes like medicine. you can see why i have a difficult time focusing on their "cool" decorations when i'm already so uncomfortable. clearly, wormhole isn't my ideal coffee shop.this is by far one of the best (if not the best) coffee houses i've ever been to in chicago. it's quite inconvenient for me to get here as it's in wicker park and i don't live near here, but it's worth it to take the bus/train if i want to get away and just hang out somewhere dark and mellow.i like that the menu is in big print above the counter. there are plenty of tables, counter seats, and a long navy-blue couch. electrical outlets are dispersed everywhere. the decor is super cool, and staff are cheery, helpful, and friendly. the iced vanilla latte was good but it's been maybe a month since i was here so i forgot if its taste had any interesting characteristics from other iced vanilla lattes i've had. i like that they use corn-based compostable straws. they also offer free wi-fi. restrooms are neat and clean. place wasn't overcrowded when i was there. i'll come back here again for sure and i recommend it for people who are looking to drink good coffee and experience the calm and cool ambiance of this coffee house.sweet. oh, love this place. the drip coffee was excellent and every single thing in here was from the 80s, which brought back sweet childhood memories. they even have a nintendo in the back (!). i hope to be back one day to spend more time at the wormhole -- it is excellent.i've been to wormhole coffee a few times. love:the decor. the kitschy. the nerdy. the science fiction-y. the 80's stuff. the videogames. i love all of that. the pictures on the walls. the nerdy apparel for sale. the nerdy names of drinks. i love that about wormhole. it makes me smile and will definitely keep me returning. heck, there's even the delorean from back to the future.latte art. their art is on point here. i enjoyed immensely the aesthetic of all of the drinks i have ordered here. this adds a flourish of fun and sophistication. in my mind, it also justifies leaving a bit of a tip to my barrista, too. meh:peanut butter koopa troopa. i read a lot about this drink and it didn't blow me away like i had hoped it would. i was expecting something sweeter, i think. maybe you can chalk it up to the fact that i'm not a big coffee drinker. perhaps i just don't know any better. it certainly wasn't bad--just nothing special or particularly appealing for me. seating. good luck finding a seat here, let alone an outlet. cross your fingers that your laptop has good battery life if you want to get work done. people who have a coveted outlet tend to hang out for a while (they know a good thing when they see it). generally, if you hang around a bit awkwardly, a place to sit will open up. the times i've been here and the barrista asked "for here or to go," he raised his eyebrows slightly when i said "for here." clearly even the barristas know it's often unreasonable to find a seat. music. it's a little bit loud for my tastes. the barristas are also pretty lively and loud, which could be disturbing if you're there to do work. overall, the wormhole is a fun spot to have a drink, but i wouldn't choose it as a place to camp out for the day to get work done. the scarcity of outlets and the general din don't lend themselves to productivity. that being said, this spot sits at a solid four stars for me. the nerdy 80's theme is just too appealing not to fall in love a little bit. this is a place i would especially recommend to similarly nerd-minded friends, especially if you're in wicker park!this has probably become one of my favorite coffee shops in chicago. it's tied with sawada for sure.great experience. it's a cool atmosphere to sit and enjoy your coffee. definitely a hit with millennials and sci-fi fans. a step up from chain coffee joints in quality, but a leap up in price. the decorations alone are a reason to stop by, particularly if you're a tourist. ps: very awesome macaroons!i used to love this place, but haven't been there in a few years.  my boyfriend and i bought coffee, he got something fancy, i got a regular black.  they both tasted pretty awful, mine tasted like mud. at least his had lots of sugar and cream but it couldn't disguise the entirety of a bad cup.  we walked out of there laughing at the pretentious, rude servers.  god forbid you ask them to explain anything on the menu without watching their eyes daringly twitching into a full on roll.as someone who lives around the corner, the hype of this place has definitely faded for me. while i do love the decoration and feel of this cozy spot, i feel like someone needs to call out the service. i'm a server so i understand the stress of the food industry, but these people are unnecessarily rude. i have yet to have a positive interaction with the staff and, as a customer, i feel like an inconvenience to them.this was hands down the best coffee i've ever had and i might now be a connoisseur but i've had my fair share of coffee and holy shit this place tops even my grandmas.where to begin! i've been wanting to go to this place for sometime now, and i finally had a chance to go there! i ordered their oolong tea and oh my freaking god it was delicious!!!! my boyfriend ordered a latte and he enjoyed it as well. it's a very cozy and cute place with unique decor. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone. oh and their playlist was great too lol.i wanted to knock wormhole down a star for being so busy i often don't go in. truth is, it's busy because it's such a cool little coffee shop. first off, the delorean. then the amazing 80's nostalgia everywhere including wifi passwords on big floppy disks. atmosphere, 5 stars easy. the coffee is awesome and they have a great selection. their specialty drinks are different and delicious. the peanut butter koopa troopa (any mario fans out there?) is an amazing treat! if i was evil is give you 1 star and hope a few less people go so i can grab a seat at the window and people watch!everytime my partner and i vacation, he finds a few quirky or quaint little coffee shops to pop into and try. in chicago, it was the wormhole. now, you need to understand that i am a starbucks-style coffee drinker through and through. i'm talking pumps upon pumps of flavor syrup, sugar, milk -- the works. i joke that michael scott from the office (who once drank just cream and sugar) and i have similar opinions on what makes good coffee. my partner, on the other hand, enjoys straight, black coffee. needless to say, it's somewhat rare when we can find a coffee shop that meets both of our flavor preferences.enter the wormhole!i'm not sure what my partner ordered, but i know he enjoyed whatever roast they had recently brewed. for goodness sake, he has a t-shirt from this place, so obviously he enjoys their stuff. i tried their homemade vanilla bean latte which was delicious. this was probably the best latte i have ever had, and even my black coffee, old-man partner enjoyed it -- and he's not into the super sweet stuff.not only do they have excellent coffee, they also have some cool 80s memorabilia and swag. my partner was especially floored by the ghostbusters desk reference. we didn't get to stay and work, read, sit, or really hang out, but it seemed like a great place to do all of the above. there's a mixture of seating and it wasn't loud at all -- probably a great place to park it for an afternoon or catch up with a friend.guys, you have to know what you're awesome. regular brew - great, bear honey latte - even better. fast wifi, cool and hipster interior, great location and working hours. gonna miss your placewormhole is in wicker park, a super cute neighborhood in chicago.  i was passing through on my way back form o'hare, and decided to make the detour to study for a bit.  i found street parking super easily.  there was lots of room inside.  the lighting was a bit dim, so i opted for a seat towards the windows.  lots of eclectic decor.  i got the cool but rude latte, which has ginger and curry powder.  it was delicious and just has the slightest kick from the ginger.  their espresso was delicious.  i only wish i lived closer so that i could come more often.if i worked here i would make sure someone made me a manager or key holder just so i could sneak in after-hours. i'd climb my way into that shell of a delorean and kick the crap out of the fake flux capacitor, like dorothy with her ruby shoes, wishing more than anything i'd be thrown into a future at least 100 years from now where hopefully the economy was better, and perhaps intriguing men stopped thinking it was cool to keep several different girlfriends at one time. who am i kidding? both will never happen.i just stopped in for some tea and the staff was polite but super strange. i'm not sure if they just thought i was strange, or if they were just the kinds of people who don't really know how to throw themselves into customer service. tea only comes in an unusually small to go cup, and even though they have larger cups, they will make no exceptions. they have "fancy tea" or tea that you can tell was actually at one time a plant. they bag the plants before dropping it into the hot water, which adds to the authenticity factor of the tea. what i don't understand is why this process took forever. even when i was handed my drink, it was with reluctance. it seemed to be hard for them to communicate. then the guy instructed me to wait a little before drinking the tea to allow it to brew in the water. anyway, mad props to the fact that this is probably one of the few non-asian places that sell jasmine tea, which is my favorite. i will be back for this alone. i agree with the other yelpers though. the customers who hang out here seem to have no soul, and are completely fixed on whatever they are working on with their laptops. it's a little unnerving because you wonder if any of them are possibly making plans to take over the world or hack into significant computer systems belonging to companies which help run the world. who knows. kind of a sketchy lot for being dressed up like hipsters. there's no talking in here. when you walk in, it's like a scratched record and everyone glares at you at the same time. i'll remember to be nowhere near here should there be a zombie apocalypse.love it! soooooo many comfy couches and one of the best chai lattes i have ever had! this is a great place to work or binge a new show somewhere other than your bed.if you're looking for a hipster coffee place with amazing retro star wars artwork all over the place, look no further. this place is great for a 3 hour catch up chat or working on your homework or your new novel. it's great for whatever. and the prices are pretty good!! plus they have some great specialty coffee - they have a honey bear latte which my friend really enjoyed. and they have a peanut butter koopa troopa drink.recommend!excellent coffee ! their selection of coffees is not your typical franchise flavors but definitely palette worthy !this place is legit!atmosphere - brought back a lot of memories of my childhood with all the 80s and 90s stuff inside. there's a to scale delorian in the ceiling! and a working nes?! how cool is that! food & drink - just had a black house blend coffee. it was really good. medium body, balanced, and a little sweet. my wife and i also had a scone that was delicious. i think it was a vanilla blackberry scone, or something of the like. if it wasn't and i'm totally off, they should make scones like that. price - very fair pricing. most of the drinks were 12 oz for 3.50-4 bucks or 16 oz for 4-4.50. real nice. before we left, i bought a few bags of whole bean coffee which came out to about 30 bucks. caught me a little off guard, but i'm sure they'll be worth it. overall - i'd definitely go back! if not for the coffee, then definitely for the working nes.if you are trying to find me, look no further than the wormhole...i've spent many hours over the past few years at this cafe, slaving away over impending deadlines and leafing through giant textbooks. maybe even more time then i spend at home. that said, here's my list of pros and cons:positives:-cool retro vibe and decor-vintage nintendo games in the back-lots of outlets-fun pastries from fritz (some are vegan, fyi)-outdoor seating in the summer-knowledgable baristas who know what they are doing-open later than most cafes in the area (until 11)-free, fast, reliable wifi-frequent buyer punch card that gets you your 11th drink for free-great location on milwaukee ave. in between the damen and division blue line stations near all the wicker park actionneutral:-unique music selection (ranging from indie rock, to 80s pop, to 90s rap): it used to be pretty flawless and i'd always have my phone out to identify the songs. however, recently it hasn't been...umm...to my taste.-creative drinks with funny names: they are not the best drinks you are going to have anywhere in the city, though most are really good. i would highly recommend the peanut butter koopa troopa! seasonal drinks in particular tend to be hit or miss.negatives:-limited seating for how popular it is, especially near the outlets. really difficult to find multiple seats together.-really loud (doesn't bother me, but could be a distraction)-difficult to find free parking if you are drivingso clearly, the pros outweigh the cons!ghostbusters. nintendo. e.t. the delorean! those were from my times and for nostalgia's sake, this five is a must-give.  to legitimize that....the atmosphere is great. i love to be surrounded with props from my childhood. are tired from all your studying? get up and take a walk around this cafe. it will not disappoint! coffee is strong. my personal favorite is the chai latte. stay alert and perk your ears up. a barista will call your name for you to pick up your coffee. don't be the annoying person with the headphones and music blasting. we don't want to hear the barista shout at the top of his/her lungs with your name on repeat.i don't think i've ever seen a local coffee shop as busy as this place. maybe it was because it was a saturday afternoon, but the wormhole was jammed full of coffee lovers and the line to order was almost out the door. from the length of the line and the amazing yelp reviews, i knew the coffee here would be worth the wait.i ordered the honey bear latte (housemade latte + honey), which seems to be one of the most popular orders here, and it was divine. the slight hint of sweetness from the honey made the latte so smooth! i was seriously tempted to order another one after i finished. the ambiance and interior design are definitely on the hipster side, which is a change from what you might get at some of the other coffee shops in wicker park, such as buzz killer espresso or intelligentsia. i'm not sure if this would be a great place to study or have a quiet conversation, especially on a saturday afternoon, but if you're in the neighborhood craving a caffeinated pick-me-up, definitely give this place a try!!i have three qualifications for a great coffee shop:1) delicious coffee and treats2) cozy and unique atmosphere 3) fast wifiwh succeeds in offering all three, but really this is one of the most unique coffee shops in the city. if you enjoy coffee shops, you owe it to experience what worm hole has to offer!not sure how to publicly respond to the owner of wormhole in regards to his request for me to forfeit my 1st amendment rights so i'll just write it as an update.a) how dare you threaten me for expressing my view? you really are a nazi.b) it's not a vessel or receptacle, it's a cup.c) nobody tried to force anybody to slice a cup in half you self absorbed dbag, i merely asked for a to-go cup.d) if there are bigger problems in the world why aren't you out there solving them?focus on the cup and the consumer mate, that is your lesson here.this place is awesome on all counts.  the throwback decor is comfortably tattered, the barristas cheerful and capable, and the wifi reliable.  oh, and the coffee?  lit' rally the best i've ever had.  my favorite is the honey bear latte, which i've tried with and without soy, and there is something so rich and creamy, and not-too-sweet, that has made it my favorite caffeinated treat when i'm in the neighborhood.  it won't be as quick as the big chains, but the finished product is worth a few extra moments, and plus ... froth art!  it does get crowded, but if you have the opportunity to settle into an armchair with a good book or your laptop, you won't feel rushed to leave. and you can even trust fellow patrons to keep an eye on your stuff when a bathroom break is required (but don't quote me on that in case someone unscrupulous happens to cross your path).  thumbs up all around for the scene and the coffee.  whether you need somewhere to freelance or are looking to pop in for a beverage while shopping on milwaukee, seek out this place!i've been here a few times when i've visited chicago from iowa city.  if you're a certain kind of child from the 80's, then you will love this place.  they have a delorean in the back, multiple homages to mogwai, and a functioning nes in the back to play.  plenty of star wars and ninja turtles gear as well.  and their espresso is named triforce.  need i say more?  i've had above average coffee here in many styles, ranging from espresso to aeropress.  in other words, this place is the best and worst of coffee hipsters, in one place.  customer service is generally fine, a bit standoffish but nothing atypical for an artisanal coffee shop.  i have had more friendly, engaged customer service elsewhere but i would still recommend wormhole for their unique atmosphere and go back.absolutely loved this coffee shop experience. relive the 80s in a couple thousand square feet. great decor and vintage items. tshirts are a little pricey but the manager was gracious enough to give me a discount on the toddler tshirt i bought! very friendly and helpful staff. 5 stars for sure!much cooler than your average cafe. these guys put the word 'retro' and made an entire world out of it inside their wicker park shop. it's like walking into a time machine, or hell, a "wormhole" and seeing all those things you loved in the 80's and 90's like vintage star wars merchandise or the nes. the coffee is not half bad neither. i cannot speak for much since i'm not one of those coffee aficionados but i always enjoy my stay here when i'm in the area and they always have some interesting drinks to offer. one day, i'll come in, order a coffee and will finally get a chance to just sit down and play some super mario bros. on their nes because every time i come in, that system is always taken which breaks my heart a little. one day...the iced vanilla lattes from here are such a delicious tasty treat. wormhole has a great way of doing sweet lattes without them being overpoweringly sweet. wormhole is a great place to grab a coffee while you are out shopping/walking around/ waiting for a table at a busy wicker park restaurant. i think the décor is a little silly - but i understand that some people like it. i never stay 'in' to drink my coffee.really cool spot, reasonable prices, not too loud to be distracting while reading but loud enough to create a great sense of white noise in the back.oh, they have a nintendo that you can play.  so yea, five stars.latte was great! i have been wanting to check this place out for a while... and ended up here during our wait for the bongo room. everyone was friendly, selection of drinks wasn't too big or too small, and again both my husband and myself really enjoyed our lattes.  just minus one star for the decor, i love the retro idea, and the memorabilia, but it doesn't seem like much time or energy was spent decorating the walls cohesively. you may go and feel like you're in your friends basement. (though, perhaps its just part of the charm to some people.) that being said though, we'll definitely be back, and it will be recommended to friends. :)nice upbeat music. thematic decorations yet clean. somehow they managed to shove a back to the future delorean in here so props for that. coffee tastes great. if you opt for "here" they give you a mug and plate. they also provide a variety of baked goods. feels like someone's home! a little too dim for a study spot but great for conversations and chillin. one of my favorite coffee places here.this is one of my favorite independent coffee shops in the city.  dark matter is great, too, as is buzzkill but the wormhole is my go-to when given the opp to pick.why do i like it so much?creative drink specials (like the honey bear latte)quirkiness of the space (fun 80's theme and a working nintendo console that i have played a few times!)variety of seating space (couch in window, chairs and tables for comp users, counter area, and sink-your-ass-in couches in back)the best chai tea!careful attention to detail by staff (artful lattes and just good blending of flavors in general)dispense-your-own water this is truly the place to go whether you are in the area (the busy milwaukee ave section of wicker park) or not. i go out of my way to get here at times, too.oh, yeah, and the back to the future delorean is neat (it's real!) as is the gremlin stuffed animals that are sprinkled about.high-fives all around for a pretty cool joint! it's very wicker park-like and that's fine by me. decor is vintage and super fun. i mean, they have a car inside on display.....(pause for dramatic effect).... in addition, you can spot an e.t. figure, old-school tv complete with the original nintendo set up to play, and a bookshelf of games in the back. and of course to pretty hip looking and fun baristas behind the bar. those to me are great ingredients for a fun little spot to hang.do this: try their herbal iced tea! it's red and beautiful and totally refreshing.don't do this: sit up at the bar for a long period of time! maybe it's just me, but those stools are lacking padding and overall comfort. if you can snag a spot at one of their bigger tables or even a comfy couch - do so! your behind will thank you :)great coffee shop! it's a very hipster bar, and i enjoyed all the little decors from the star wars posters, to the delorean everyone talks about, and all the little knicks and random gadgets they have sprawling everywhere.my girlfriend and i ordered the peanut butter koopa troopa and honey bear latte. i chose the koopa troopa to try something different, but it was ok. i'm just not used to the peanut butter taste in my coffee. however, the honey bear was outstanding! it was very smooth, with just the right amount of sweetness. the beans were very fresh, and the baristas know what they're doing. definitely stop by for a break, i love wormhole!edit: i gave this place one star after my last time in (see below), i updated my review to three stars after the owner showed concern about my experience. i will be coming back to try again, hopefully i will have a better experience and be able to increase my review further. i work at a coffee shop, so i know my order is sort of stupid. i order a cold brew in a 12oz paper cup without ice. every time i order this the baristas here are super rude about it. this time when i went in and ordered this, she tried to talk me into putting it into a plastic cup. when i declined this, she scoffed at me telling me the cup would leak, then proceeded to talk shit about me to her co worker. i don't understand why they won't just make my order, if anything i'm paying more per volume probably.the only thing i knew about wormhole coffee heading in was that it was close to where i was staying and that they had a delorean in the shop. having a close inside joke with somebody about deloreans, i knew i had to make my way in plus the shop clearly had some inspiration from back to the future.walking in, i felt that the name had done the coffee shop justice. it was as though i'd been sucked into a wormhole into the late 1980s. from movie posters to video games present, it could not have felt more like a parallel world.had i stayed to do work, they continued with floppy disks with the wifi passwords. wifi : babywurm; password: slowdownchewyourfood. lol.i had a lovely cappuccino at wormhole. in fact, i went back for a second before leaving. definitely a spot to check out!while wormhole has a lot of creative specials, i always opt for their chai - so top notch! always hits the spot, and i think the best chai in the area.wormhole has seriously sweet decor, complete with a friggin' delorean hanging in the rafters. there are other 80's era movie posters around, as well. so much fun hanging around in here. when we came, it was super packed, i don't know how anyone finds a seat. you need to get either very early or very lucky. lots of laptops, so they looked like they were in for the long haul.now, onto what matters. i tried a shot of espresso. i had the triforce, which was very good. it is sweeter than your average espresso, so it works great on its own without any sweet add-ons. i would happily get it again, but they refuse to put it in a to-go cup. very annoying. what if i wanted to sip slowly? given the lack of seats, i couldn't sit and stay awhile, so it was either pound it or stand around. c'mon people.to be very honest, i don't understand the hype and appeal of this place. it's one of wicker park's most popular coffee shops and study areas, but i feel like its coffee and warm drinks are mediocre and the seating area is small, uncomfortable and poorly lit. i'd recommend checking out the other coffee shops in the area."a wormhole, or einstein-rosen bridge, is a hypothetical topological feature that would fundamentally be a shortcut connecting two separate points in spacetime that could connect extremely far distances such as a billion light years or more, short distances, such as a few feet, different universes, and in theory, different points in time. a wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in spacetime," says sir wikipedia. the bleakness of october weighed down on chicago like a ton of worms. which happened to be my location. wicker park, milwaukee ave. to be precise. i almost missed it but out of the corner of my eye i saw a sign that said the wormhole. innocently, not knowing the forces that lay within, i pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside. immediately and with a surprising lack of commotion, i was transferred back to the 80s. i never got to experience the 80s because i was born in the 90s. until now of course.the 80s turned out to be a lot like i would have expected. this was a time when ghostbusters, teenage mutant ninja turtles and calvin and hobbes were popular. you could play video games with the original nintendo on tvs with rabbit ears. back to the future was new and popular. that meant that deloreans were also popular. the original apple macintosh was a cutting edge piece of equipment. and apparently it was highly popular to eat cold cereal in public. all of this and more can be seen in a visit to the 80s. perhaps the most surprising thing was that somehow good coffee existed back then. before my time warp experience i was on a chicago caffeine crawl and this turned out to be stop the third. somehow they managed to suck a synesso back through their wormhole. they use halfwit coffee. surely that company wasn't going way back in the 80s. which brings me to a new question. how does the coffee retain its freshness and consistency traveling back and forth through time like that? when i stepped out the door back into current time, was my pour-over which was brewed in the 80s, then 30 years old? if so, i'm happy to announce that 30 year old coffee can be amazingly delicious. an unexpected trip to the 80s could really mess up my plans. but that was not to be so. all i had to do was step back through the door and i would be transferred via an einstein-rosen bridge back to the present. i did so and continued my journey into the gloom that was present day chicago.yay, i'm a fan. yes, the coffee was really tasty and delicious. the only stressful part was how close the seating was to other costumers/limited seating. i felt uncomfortable most of the time in the space. but their coffee is really really delicious, i would recommend it as a great spot to grab and go!i think i just found my new favourite coffee place to get work done you guys. usually i would never travel all the way to wicker park just for a spot to do work but i'm glad i did this time. the ambiance of this place was totally my kind of thing. i walked in and i saw the delorean straight ahead and a heathers poster on my right and i was totally sold. there are also some cafe's where you just want to put your earphones in and not talk to anyone, but here, i really enjoyed their playlist plus i didn't mind that someone wanted to strike up a conversation despite the work i had to do. super comfy and the staff were really friendly. i got their 12 oz vanilla bean late for $4.50 which i thought was pretty reasonable. it was really good too. i sat there for a few hours and got a little hungry so i got a ham and cheese croissant. i didn't enjoy the croissant as much as i liked the coffee though. so i'm just going to stick to their drinks the next time i visit. and yes, i'm definitely going again. :)today was "feels like 18°" and i was craving really warm coffee or tea. my friend recommended trying wormhole in wicker park.we arrived around 5 p.m and all the couches and chairs were occupied. people were doing all sorts of things from practicing calligraphy, reading, studying, or pretending to study but really browsing through facebook. how cozy was the thought that came into my head. the figurines, calvin and hobbes comics, action figure posters, and the car in the back of the store gave us the familiar and nostalgic feeling of childhood and geekiness. if you are a geek in any way, you will appreciate this place!i ordered a vanilla bean latte and my friend ordered hot chocolate. the drinks took a while but they were excellent. we settled ourselves in comfy couches and i joyfully read through calvin and hobbes while sipping on my latte. having permission to be a dork in a public gave me the greatest happiness. although i hate to, i have to knock off one star because it's not the most private place. due to its popularity, you often have to share a table with a stranger. i know that this is okay for most people, but sometimes it's uncomfortable to share conversation over tea when you know someone can listen in on it.  bring your laptop, a book, a hobby, and a nice friend! what's a wonderful way to spend the day but in a worm hole.when i started dating my now gf last january i was introduced to wormhole. probably one of the top 5 reasons i fell in love with her is the discovery of this fantastic coffee shop. of course the vibe is fantastic, but the care the baristas take in making the delicious beverages is beyond. my order used to be the normal latte but i switched it up recently to the vanilla bean latte. they use vanilla bean paste - to die for. skip bongo room and just go here!great place to get homework done in wicker park. delicious coffee and teas. staff is very friendly and the patrons tend to be equally as friendly, i've been here on several occasions for over 6 hours for homework-cramming and have never had an issue. my only reason for taking away a star is that last time i was here, i was sitting on a couch and developed full body hives... not sure how often they clean the couches or which chemicals are used. i'll be careful not to wear shorts next time, and definitely not to sit on a couch.i got to wormhole in a quickie, and ate a delicious cookie. oh, and i must mention the coffee. mocha, cocoa, honey bear, citrus, and vanilla beannnnn...(please sing in lucky charms tune). but really, this place is where the magic happens - people watching, talking, working (ew), sipping, slurping, and maybe even some chugging (yes, the coffee is that dang good).i squirmed my way into wormhole on a sunday evening and i couldn't be more in love with it now. it's definitely my favorite coffee shop in chicago. i'm actually not a regular coffee drinker (cue shock), but when i do drink coffee, it better not be bitter like some other coffee made by a green "regal" lady. wormhole uses amazing halfwit coffee, and mannn does it hit the spot. their drinks are absolutely delicious. i do love me some regulars - cappuccino, mocha, lattes, but their specialty drinks are particularly delicious. and if you don't like that strong stuff (in the alcohol world, the equivalent of everclear), then their specialty drinks are mmm, mmm, good (think of smirnoff ice. c'mon men, you know it's delish). my favorite specialty drink is the honey bear latte, but i've heard great things about the peanut butter chocolate.but that's not all lovers and friends, wormhole and fritz pastry 'bout to do it again. yup, that's right - they sell fritz pastries. and though i literally live 4 blocks away from fritz itself, there's something about pairing these delicious pastries with wormhole's amazing coffee. i would definitely recommend getting a pastry, cookie, cupcake, or any of that sugary magicalness. my personal favorite is the chocolate chip cookie with pretzels on it. it's salty and sweet and absolutely delicious.the coffee and bakery items are great, and even though the staff was nice to me, i can tell it wasn't genuine and didn't feel welcome at all. as soon as i walked in, i was stared down at by everyone in the shop. it's pretty obvious that if you don't fit the "hipster" criteria, they don't really want you to hang around. i stayed anyway to get some work done despite the noisy environment. nonetheless, the layout is pretty dope and the coffee is delicious.okay so the place is amazing, i love the vintage set up of it and of course the ever so famous delorean! next the coffee was so good! i ordered the koopa troopa, i love the unique mix of peanut butter and dark cocoa (best of both worlds) i would love to try the other coffee that they offer. i also tried the huge cookie but wasn't so much impressed with it but anyway, over all it was a great coffee experience! def my fave coffee shop!big shout to the wormhole for 1. letting me bring in my dog and 2. vegan donuts.  good coffee, better staff.whenever i have visitors come in from out of town, i take them here. wormhole's decor, trendy location in the wicker park neighborhood, and tasty drinks are guaranteed to make out-of-towners fall in love with chicago. i can't really say i am a regular here - i live too far from this area for that - but when i do go, i really enjoy the peanut koopa troopa and the vanilla bean latte. the drinks are not overly sweet but are made just right. i wished i lived closer so i could go everyday.fun happening place akin to a non-corporate starbucks. great nerdy/geeky decor that looks like it was ripped out of the big bang theory. but the highlight of it all is the coffee!it's all about the americano and the peanut butta koopa troopa! these are my go-tos and i've never found the need to try anything else. though i'd imagine it'd be just as good if i did. if you're looking for a spot to spend $5 on coffee. this is it. i especially love the artistry on their cream. i've seen flowers, roses, smiley faces, hearts and a stormtroopers head made and it's all very impressive.great coffee shop, with the best aroma of coffee i've ever smelt in a coffee shop. you smell the coffee outside the doors, all around their outdoor seating.they offer a vast variety of brews, with little-to-no dark roast selections. i almost always choose dark roasts, and was hesitant to order, given their absent dark-roast selection; however, the medium roasts were amongst the best i've ever had... even when juxtaposed with some of my favorite dark blends. the space is open and airy. the prices are on point. the shop sells knick knacks. this is one of my favorite cafes.i heard nothing but good things about wormhole. i even heard that it was supposedly the best cafe in chicago. i came here very eagerly to try the supposed "best cafe in chicago" as well as pick up some halfwit.the cashier was a bit snooty. the place wasn't unusually busy and it wasn't at an unreasonable time (4:30 pm) so i don't know what that was about. in fact, the whole place gave off a strange, buy-and-get-the-hell-out kind of vibe, which is unusual from everything i've read. i got the peanut butter koopa troopa (i normally get a cappuccino but i figured, why not do something different.) i didn't see pourovers on the menu but i did see chemexes on the merch table. (strange how the more pretentious cafes don't do pourovers. when you brew coffee with a kettle, that earns you the right to be a dingleberry.) i also got some kenya alimu halfwit, which i'm excited to try in my chemex.my girlfriend got the chai, which came fresh from a powder. my koopa was one of the tastiest things i've ever gotten from a coffee shop.due to the powdered chai and strange vibe, i gotta knock off a star. i'm definitely willing to return though.edit: the gm messaged me and went into detail about how there are, indeed, pourovers; i thought they didn't do them, so that was my mistake. he was a friendly guy who cares about his shop, so i'm bumping this review up to five stars. especially since the halfwit kenya alimu beans i bought were really, really good. probably my favorite beans i've gotten in chicago.wifi adequate but make sure you nab a seat at the tables to get in vicinity of any plugs. i won't lie; the baristas are cute and sometimes chatty. vanilla latte and honey bear latte are popular and soothing choices. the banana-pudding flavored "cosby" was a surprisingly mellow winter drink. the "cool but rude" with spices and curry powder can be kind of too sweet but you can always ask them to make any drink with less sugar. the coffee is strong but *do not buy the cascara coffee-cherry tea* that they sell in the bags. it's about $10 and you will be disappointed. it tasted nothing like coffee nor tea, but like wine. in the summer they have an iced drink called "rocket sauce" that's a combination of ginger, lemon and mate. it tastes like a lightly sweetened lemony ice tea.i was there once til closing and they gave pastries away for free :-)cool decor, less-than-average coffee, subpar baristas. as i waited for my americano, i listened to the barista tell another customer how he is moving away and he had "completely checked out". unfortunately it was very evident in the 2 beverages i ordered. my wife & i love coffee & will make-do with anything but the coffee was so bad, my wife threw her's away after 2 sips & it was just an americano. the 80's decor didn't make the coffee taste better, but it was fun to look at!first time going there and i really liked it. definitely one of the best coffee shops in the city, i got the americano and i thought it was good. i tried the honey bear latte as well and it was delicious. i really like the whole 80s theme. i can't wait to go back and try something new.my only complaint is it being too far from where i live.i love the chai latte and the coffee here! i've tried their ice coffee with soy milk and vanilla soy latte so far and it's all been great. i love the decor - they have a delorean car model in the cafe and a bunch of cool gadgets referencing classic movies and games.they also have a punchcard where if you get ten drinks, you qualify for a free drink! i'm definitely interested coming back and getting more punchholes!back when i used to live in wicker park, this was my go-to spot! the delorean that they have is as cool as it gets, and the retro decor brings me back to good times. i recently went with my boyfriend, who is a die-hard back to the future fan, and he was psyched. service is always good, even cheerfully accommodating to special requests. i've never gotten anything i didn't like. they also have retro video games open for anyone to play, so it's a great place to meet people and chill. the only downer is that the last couple of times i've been there, it was full so there was no seating space, so we've had to leave after getting our coffee. hopefully next time it won't be so busy so we can hang out!amazing drinks. i had the koopa troopa and the honey bear latte. love the video game aesthetic of the place. it is packed most of the time so don't expect the best seatinggreat ambience for getting some work or studying done. most importantly, they're open till 11pm today while most other cafés in the neighborhood close around 8pm. as someone who gets off work at 6 and gets home by 7, this place is pretty much my only option. recommended drink: honey bear lattewho doesn't love a coffee shop with the bttf delorean inside and who makes intricate artwork in your tasty latte foam? i'm impressed!final verdict:local indie coffee shop i love to stop in at any time i'm perusing milwaukee ave!!i must admit, i am mostly reviewing the wormhole with the romantic image engrained in my mind upon my initial few visits in 2011. i remember meeting james (?) who was/is the owner (?) when it first opened. they were even giving free t-shirts away to publicize the spot. i still wear mine to bed. it's a "hipster" size small and hugs me in places i wish it didn't, but that's another story... i recently moved back to chicago, and returned to the wormhole a couple times since. wormhole has become incredibly popular (yay for them!)... and rightfully so! however, while their coffee and pastries have remained solid and their baristas are friendly, it gets so crowded/ busy at times that my sipping-coffee-and-reading-a-book-sundays are increasingly difficult to enjoy. (i swear, it's that delorean! love it for its kitsch, but geez that attracts so many people there.) though i still have a special place in my coffeehouse heart for the wormhole, luckily when it gets too hectic to hang out, i can hop to other wicker park/bucktown spots for a little less traffic.many people remark on how awesome this place is for their atmosphere and decor. i mean, they have a delorean! but, for people who like coffee, this place is just as awesome. i'm not talking about their lattes, which are great, believe me, but their simple, just-coffee coffee. a simple pour-over may seem a bit trivial to some, but the technique and the measurements and the timing all adds to how that cup of coffee will taste, and wh has yet to disappoint. even with beans from roasters that i've visited and tried the original roast, the flavors are on point and wonderful. the quirky atmosphere is a little pleasure to the wonderful cups of coffee you can get here, and i will keep coming back week after work for a good brew.honey bear latte iced or hot, just makes my day!!! i love going here when i'm on my weekend stroll around the neighborhood. i also always bring friends and family who are in town visiting to check out wh.  it's just such a fun place to enjoy some good coffee.if you like lattes and 80s memorabilia, then look no further than the wormhole. the lattes and pastries are tasty, and some are even vegan-friendly. try the homemade vanilla bean latte or the peanut butter koopa troopa (if you want something a bit more unusual...and super mario themed).it can be difficult to get a seat, as the shop has a steady stream of customers, many of whom tend to linger. but when you can enjoy your coffee and get work done in the company of a delorean, who can blame them for lingering?+++i was extremely impressed with the friendly staff++- i liked the koompa troopa, would have never thought to mix peanut butter, chocolat and coffee product, but it works, it does not need sugar+they let you linger around all daythe wife liked the honey/milk latte, it does not need sugariced coffee was regular-(although minor) they ran out of sugar and cream, i guess there wasn't constant upkeepits like a computer cluster (for those who went to college before 2006) with a lot of lingereres it is very difficult to get a seat if you don't get there earlya sucker is born every minute and i am a sucker for bizarre combos of food and drink. i debated between the pb koopa troopa (for some reason, i kept want to say chupacabra, a legendary folklore animal), and the ginger+curry latte... can't remember the name. anyway, i wanted something a bit sweeter and opted for that pb version. the girl who worked at the counter assured both are permanent items so i'll have to go back to try the other.while sipping, i see the baristas weigh their coffee beans. is that how they  ensure precision for each cup? coffee nerds rejoice! i could be wrong, i don't know, they just might be doing something else, but man, it is good.hoping they'll continue to make other interesting creations. i missed out on my chance in south korea to sample the mozzerella latte and sweet potato. (hint, hint)thundercats. alf. ghostbusters. tmnt. e.t. for nostalgic purposes, i'm going a fiver. "which way does the line go?" would be my only gripe on a busy day. but other than that...this place is magic. #fact.i've been to wormhole twice (and counting) now. my first visit was on a rare sunday off work and i decided on a whim that driving 25 miles from palatine to wormhole's city digs for chai was a completely normal and not-so-inconvenient thing. a practical jedi, i am not. was it worth it? #ubetcha!i even strayed outside my usual beverage comfort zone (the largest size chai tea latte w/soy) for the wormhole's seasonal treat: chai-der. supakewt name + supadelish blend of chai tea and hot apple cider = a blissful afternoon into evening for this little mogwai.a coffee shop that is also the home to a back to the future delorean?what else do you need to know?  that they also have a nes set up with games and a couch for your gaming pleasure?oh, that they have a peanut butter koopa troopa latte that will take you to peanut butter heaven? that their baristas are actually worth paying $4-5 for a latte?  artists, i tell ya!  i appreciate artwork in my lattes.that their chai tea latte is so good they should of named a spice girl after it?  wormhole chai spice?  no?  yea, i lost myself there, too...it was working in my head for a minute.i could go on, but really what else do you need to know?  if i'm telling you it's good, well then it's damn good.  worm your way over to wormhole for some drinkable artwork in a mug.*don't forget to pick up a punch card for future visits, because you will be back.i stop by this place every time i'm in the area, so i think it's about time i give it five stars. yes, they have good coffee, let's get that out of the way. most cafes have decent enough coffee, right? onto the stuff that makes wormhole unique enough that you should visit whenever you can. drinks: i always love trying out what's "exclusive" to any place, and wormhole has some pretty cool drinks. the honey bear latte tastes like a warm cup of honey nut cheerios. i love peanut butter and chocolate as much as anyone, but i appreciate that the peanut butter koopa troopa still tastes like coffee and not like one giant reese's cup. the cool but rude has such a "clean" spice that's refreshing even in a hot drink. space: this is a cafe you want to hang around in, not just grab your drink and go. if all the cool nerd art isn't capturing your attention, grab a seat on the couch and watch whoever's playing super nintendo attempt to reach the next level in mario. or just space out and listen to the great music pumpin through the speakers at a reasonable volume. your choice. if i'm anywhere near this place, i make a point to stop by. you should too.there's a reason wormhole coffee has been on america's best coffee 'peanut butter koopa troopa' says it quite well.it's a quirky place with a lot of random things hanging on the walls and nestled in places that you might have grown up with. very hipster like atmosphere.there's not as much place to sit about as you'd expect of such a popular place, but everyone is friendly enough to share a couch or table with you if you've a mind to work there for a while.i've indulged in tea here, since it is my go to drink, but have also enjoyed their honey bear latte.i've tried to find this place twice already. driving around in circles, on milwaukee ave, with no luck at finding it. is this place real?  and can i play wow here?i love this coffee shop! it's got the car from back to the future on the back wall and is a great place to unwind with a coffee with a friend for get some work done. very hip and excudes a great vivegreat looking cafe, it a shame staff sucks. they were rude and didn't know how to make the coffee i wanted. the woman that made the coffee had no idea what she was doing. it was 10 degrees outside. i ordered a espresso. i asked to add some warm to it to bring down the temperature,but not ice. ice to coffee brings up the acidity level and make ice steaming coffee more bitter. espresso is bitter enough. she had no idea what i was talking about it take the coffee people probably a good 15 minutes to make, but all them had a great conversations and joking around. hello, trying working.cute spot with lots of memorabilia and unique drink choices, along with the classics. super packed and not much free seating! when we visited, drinks were significantly backed up, but the cashier let us know beforehand, in case we didn't want to wait.we came for the delorean. it was glorious. since we were there already, we sipped tiny macchiatos and nibbled on pastries (a vegan apple pop tart and a black raspberry macaron). the wifi was plentiful as evidenced by the droves of young people with laptops at the tables. and the whole place is a feast for the geeky eyes. see if you can spot marvin the martian or the millenium falcon.i love the wormhole; they captured my heart with two things:1.  the cosby.  a hot or iced coffee drink that tastes like banana pudding.2.  an old school tv with vintage nintendo video games.  we played a bit of super mario for awhile.i think we were the only ones feeling the warm fuzzies.  i think we may have been the only ones with functioning emotions - the ability to hug, tear ducts that work, and hearts that beat.  all of the patrons in here were robotic!  they were mostly leeching on the wifi and barely moved.  i'm not sure if some of them were even breathing.  on top of being wifi leeches, some people here were careless about taking up large amounts of space at large tables and on the sofa.  welcome to the wormhole, you do not exist.we almost got our drinks to go (one cosby and one "koopatroopa," a chocolate peanut butter beverage), but we spied some open seats in the back and got really lucky when some mindless drones left the sofa.  i decided it was time to go once we had both huffed and puffed a little too loudly after losing at super mario a few too many times.i like that the place is decorated in 80s memorabilia.  i excitedly pointed at the lunchboxes when i recognized the "beauty and the beast" one that i carried in second grade.  the fake delorean on display is pretty cool too, and if you didn't already catch this, the beverages have fun names that reflect the 80s as well.good theme.  great coffee.  lots of robots, i mean hipsters, camping out on macs.  it was time to pack up my rainbows and sunshine and move along.very cool 80s themed coffee shop. you have a few different crowds that cycle through and there's a bit for everyone. large community tables make study and work possible if you can tune out the noise, the bar by the coffee roasters is a good place to read too. they also have a tv in the back with old games and nooks at the front and back of the shop with couches for larger groups to sit together. whether you're stopping by to hang out with friends, waiting for the bongo room or a quick sip of coffee it's very comfortable and relaxing.i'm currently in here sitting on one of the most uncomfortable couches i've ever had the misfortune of sitting on (in an oscars race it'd probably get a nomination but the statue will end up going to another god forsaken couch), but it's worth it right? completely.wormhole is such a gem of a place and conveniently located steps away from the damen blue line stop. at any given night you can be shoulder to shoulder with a couple on a first date, a local catching up on some reading, or a student (me) frantically trying to finish a 15 pg paper before a looming deadline. it has the kind of unique decor that seamlessly blends together cool, kitschy, and comfortable.  there are plenty of seating but expect none of them to be too forgiving on your bum and a lot of people  that are forced to sit on chairs end up placing their drinks and plates on the floor. errrrrr, food on the floor? i don't know about that. the ambience of the place makes up for most of the shortcomings though.and the drinks! reasonably priced and (the ones i've had) really satisfying. they have a "top five players" list consisting of what i'm assuming is their most popular drinks: homemade vanilla bean, honey bear latte, peanut butter koopa troopa, cool but rude, and smoke signals. all good and worth trying (and all below $5) but i'm finding it hard to really say anything else about them. not unique enough, i guess? solid nonetheless. a well-deserved four stars for the friendly/quick service, the 80's decor complete with calvin + hobbes art in the restrooms, and overall ambience. oh! the walking dead's steven yeun (glenn) swung by here a couple of weeks ago also.i'm a regular here. they have great coffee, multiple different kinds of seating options [from couches to bar stools], friendly baristas, tons of outlets, and an 80's sci-fi kitsch explosion that suits my nerdy-tinged tastes. great pastries and nostalgia inducing breakfast cereals.clientele range from the daily commuter getting a to-go coffee to the all-day hacker, freelancer, or graduate student working on their latest project.  mostly 20s-30s crowd of hipsters, intellectuals, "outdoorsy"/hippy/yoga-lovers, and some norm-cores. dude-bros mostly absent, thankfully!it can be super busy especially on weekends in the late morning hours when brunch-seekers are waiting for tables to open at the near-by bongo room, so be smart - get there early.great little coffee shop in wicker park! first impressions mean everything, and wormhole lived up the the hype. the space is huge and inviting: lots of seating, including tables and comfy couches. the food selection is everything you might expect from a good coffeehouse: lots of locally made baked goods. but the real stars at wormhole are, of course, the espresso drinks. i almost always opt for a regular latte or cappuccino, but i took the recommendation and went with a "specialty drink" since all of the flavours are made in house. the vanilla latte did not disappoint! just the right amount of sweetness, great taste, and smooth espresso. yum!(late and non local customer)the wormhole was my first coffee shop stop in chicago when i visited over the summer duringa cross country road trip. i definitely was not disappointed. the decor (the de lorean) has to be one of the best in any shop ever. i got to talking to the barista chris(? lost my notes so i may be totes off) he walked me through his coffee journey and how he's lived in all lower 48 and was moving and looking to get out of the coffee game after 10 years. dude was super nice and pulled a really nice pour over. he even cracked open one of their new single origins for me to smell and holy shit it smelled more blueberry than the freshest blueberries. the decor, the video games, the atmosphere, the baristas and the manual brew won't disappoint. if you were to come to only one shop in the chicago area, this is it.ok, so maybe it's hipster heaven in here - but they make one hell of a good cup of coffee.i have been going to wormhole coffee for a while now, and every time i go in i wonder how they got that delorean in there. like, was it brought in pieces? did the employees all carry it in through the door? is it one of those things where it's really small and you put it in water and it gets bigger? i need to know, but i'm terrified to ask. besides my constant fear that everything i say is stupid, i also wonder if it'll lose the appeal once i know the truth. it's like, do i watch the x-files all the way to the end, or stop watching when everyone tells me it gets bad? i don't know what to do, you guys. anyway, the coffee's good, the staff is super nice, and they play good music. it's a great place to hang out, write some sad short fiction, check your email, or stare at the wall and think about your life.there's something about sipping on a peanut butter chocolate coffee drink while playing old school nintendo that makes me grin.don't be afraid to snuggle with all your fellow geeks because wormhole seems to always be elbow to elbow. pro tip: duck hunt has a two person mode where 1 player can control the ducks.i walked in here on a saturday around 3pm on a nice day and it had a lot of customers but the service was fairly quick. it had a cool retro decor with a lot of references to movies like star wars, back to the future and gremlins. i had the koopa troopa and it was deliciously refreshing. they had a few sofas and tables for seating and in the back of the shop under the delorean was an old television with super mario bros, on some old game console i don't know, for customers to play with. also, the cashier guy had a cool cat shirt and was very nice. in all, i would totally go back for another coffee to explore the place some more.after randomly stumbling upon this place, i was instantly surprised by the interior and how awesome it was! it's a really unique coffee shop, with a 1980's/90's feel. complete with an old apple desktop!i chose the honey bear latte, which was perfect! a hint of honey, not too overpowering, and it's just delicious. highly recommend this place! the baristas were very nice, so if you want to explore the menu they're patient. definitely a great place, i'll be back next time i'm in chicago.this is one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. they're open super freaking early, and they stay open till super freaking late. till around 11 pm, which is unheard of. also-- the coffee is amazing. i'm not much of a coffee drinker, but i definitely get either their honey bear latte or the vanilla bean latte whenever i'm here. they also make great espresso shots! they make really good chai too. the reason i love this place is because there are so many convenient places to work here. they have a communal table with chargers and free wi-fi. i love wormhole, and i'm not writing much about it because you can see everyone else loves it too :) it gets crowded fast though, so come early so you don't have to stake out for a seat.tried this place on a recommendation from my sister's roommate while i was visiting my sister in chicago. i needed a place to hang out for the day and get some work done, and this was a wonderful place to do it!i'm not incredibly familiar with chicago, but i was told the neighborhood is fairly hipster and this place oozed quirkiness. this was immediately apparent when they told me the wifi password was on the floppy disk. they have a full sized delorean in the back, as well as a tv with an nes hooked up and a few couches.i sat down near the back where i found a spot and there were many other people there working hard (or hardly working?). it was fairly quiet but had a good bustle coming in and out, so definitely not silent.i had a latte and a cinnamon roll and both were solid. i was hoping for some warm food, but i didn't see any on the menu which was my own fault for not checking it before i went.definitely recommended for the ambiance and being a great place to work! the food and drink weren't amazing, but definitely not bad and i would visit again.the coffee here is legit. decor is entertaining and original, and service is good. the honey bear latte is quite possibly the best latte i've ever had. it was smooth and creamy, and cut the acidity of the coffee well. it wasn't ridiculously sweet so that i can still taste all the natural elements of coffee and milk. all in all a well done beverage.wormholians are probably not going to be happy with my a-ok rating, but it's my truth. i judge a coffee shop by more that just its coffee. if my review were just about coffee, then sure it would be a solid 4 stars. and the people behind the counter are super friendly too. i feel like wormhole has an identity issue. it wants to be hipster hangout/artisan coffee joint/1980s nostalgia market. it's confusing, the feng shui is off kilter and i don't even fully understand feng shui, i just know when it's off. pick an identity and run with it. here's my unsolicited advice: if you are going to have 80s memorabilia, then at least display the nicely maintained pieces, not the smurf and gremlins who look like they went to all night binger and fell in the sewer. i went there to study and get my sf ritual coffee fix. apparently, ritual was just a visiting roaster and they are gone now. insert sad face on this san franciscan. coffee good. get it to go. atmosphere weird.after a series of weekends filled up with to-do's, our idea of adventure was finding a neighborhood coffeeshop and just chilling out with good coffee over casual conversation! we found this place thanks to yelp and ended up spending 3 good hours and after a few good drinks, vowed to return soon! the only 1 missing star is because some of their cool seating is so old that we were sunken in and uncomfortable.came here on a recommendation from my glorious airbnb host, kirill :) i did not regret the visit. i felt as if i was transported back to my childhood. my old mac computer was converted to the cream/sugar coagulation station, posters of my favorite childhood films were up, even the lettering on the chalkboard menu was written in pac man fashion (the best video game in the whole world!).... this place kills it with their coffee chemistry obsession and 80's ambience. at the end of my coffee cup experience, i just wanted to run up to my hip bearded server and give him the biggest kiss! this place is a winner... #nailedit!10/10cute coffee shop that has a true vintage feel. they have an original nintendo in the back that you can actually play with some olddddddd school games. also an og mac computer in the front. the store is laid out well so that there are plenty of places to sit and study if need be. the couches in the back are great for catch up sessions with friends the coffee is very good as well!check this place outmaybe i'm too old for this place or not hipster enough. don't get me wrong the coffee is very good, but i can get metropolis coffee many other places nearby. i disliked that their large is truly a medium. i need a lot of coffee and that isn't going to cut it for me.  like any typical wicker park establishment, it's hipster-dominated and usually i'm fine with something about this place just rubs me the wrong way.  there are so many coffee joints within walking distance i find that myself frequenting others instead of wormhole.this is place is a geek's haven. i'm gonna be a regular here for as long as i'm in chicago. and fyi, they only serve coffee and a few muffins/cookies (they don't have a microwave). a detailed review coming soon.maybe one of the last cool places on milwaukee, the hipsters messed up the hood...killer vibes, super friendly staff, good drinks/snacks, and instant 5 star rating for having a delorean time machine in the shop.i'm in love. absolutely madly in love with the wormhole. it is my new favorite coffee shop! everything about it is fantastic! if you love the 80s. you, too, will fall deep in love with the wormhole.i've been wanting to go here for awhile and when i finally did i was anxious to see what an 80s coffee shop would be like and was kind of expecting to be let down. from the second i walked in and saw the delorean and all the cool 80s decor, i knew things were going to be good. it is a very hipster type of shop, it's in wicker park afterall, but the workers are amazing. hipsters i'm sure, but the non pretentious type which is always refreshing. i went on their one year anniversary so i actually got a free cupcake! awesome! and the cupcake was delicious.i'm having a hard time remembering exactly what type of coffee i got but i know it had something orange flavored in it. it was fantastic and they did that fancy schmancy coffee artwork in it. love it!after getting our coffees and cupcakes, we sat on the couch right in front of the tv. i had the same type of big ol' tv in my house growing up so that was fun. and we started playing nintendo! i think i impressed my friend with my super mario 3 skills. little did he know that i am a master of super mario 1 and 3 in nintendo and i totally owned him. i had no idea they had nintendo in the shop so that was a huge bonus! plus they had tons of games! i could have sat there for hours hogging the nintendo! suggestion...add a second couch/nintendo area so i don't feel so bad about playing for an hour straight while jealous onlookers eyeball me.then the music. ah yes, the music is amazing! i heard some journey, elton john, and a lot of the 80s classics. i absolutely love 80s music and would have loved to hear a little more of the less known 80s musics...maybe just some popular songs instead of just the mega hits! either way, it was totally amazing and i was annoying my friend greatly by singing along to everything.as i said, i'm totally in love with the wormhole! i'll be back and soon, taking all of my friends to this awesome coffee shop!great place to check out if you're in the area and want to get some work done. i loved the honey bear, i could taste the honey and coffee beans perfectly. barista's are solid, environment is comfy, and all the 80's nostalgia hits home for the alternative crowd. loved the music and volume, it was just right. definitely will come back!!!wormhole cafe is like a breath of fresh air. they care about their environmental impact and it shows! from a green standpoint:positives: the shop offers mugs and glassware to all of their dine-in customers. their to-go cups are made by a green company that relies on post consumer materials for production. they have recycling in shop, and have all of their drink add-ins (milk and sugar, etc.) in large refillable containers instead of the packaged single serving options. for their napkins, they have recycled paper, which is way more responsible than using virgin paper products. their baked goods are not wrapped in plastic, which is how a lot of coffee shops keep their pastries, and they serve all food on washable plates with silverware. negatives: there are those days that you go into the cafe and do see the majority of patrons with disposable cups... not sure if it is a specific employee who prefers it, but it would be great if it happened less. all and all, wormhole is a great example of how a company can keep their carbon footprint small and be responsible in their impact on the community.i felt like trying a new coffee spot since i was in the city and this place had some really good yelp reviews. i tried the peanut butter koopa troopa like many people recommended and i was not disappointed. i also got a sprinkles donut which was square shaped with a donut hole on top. i loved how dense and not super greasy the donut was. can't wait to go back here!needed a place to hang out for a few hours while working and waiting for my next meeting.  trusty yelp app, coffee/tea filter, and wormhole appears!  instead of running away as fast as possible (as suggested whenever the random wormhole appears), i bravely headed straight there... and to my delight, the adventure was wonderful.vanilla bean latte - $4 - beautiful and delicious, and the small was a perfect 8 oz of caffeine.free wifi - along with the caffeine, will allow me to get lots of research/work done (once i finish this review that is!)decor - there's a delorean with han solo in the back, nintendo 8 bit art on the walls, old school lunchboxes across the backwall, and even a little tv with a video game system hooked up for kids (and adults who never grew up) to play while relaxing on some comfy couches.this place is awesome.  it's a wormhole straight to my old school years of youth.  verdict:  check this place out... and i'm going to attempt to get back to work, as long that glowing triforce behind the coffee bar doesn't distract me too much.super cool coffer shop. took the l train all the way out to wicker just to check it out. has an 80's movie theme including a back to the future replica car. the entire decor is creative and fun and give a good comfortable coffee house vibe. very friendly staff. smiled and personable throughout our conversation which sadly is rare in independent coffee shops (even highly rated ones i find). the coffee was amazing. i got the honey bear latte with soy and couldn't have been happier.  perfect amount of froth and foam. so glad i checked it out!i gotta be real, it was 100% the staff that warrants this rating.the decor is ridic and will summon every lonely memory you had of the 80s(but like, in a good way).i ordered off the specialswhich were highly varied and interesting in their coffee treatment.i got the nelly. you know, because nelly.not for the coffee purist, but i have confidence that they know what they're doing.had i not been totally enchanted into ordering the nelly,and this will be the last time i say the nelly,i think it would have been a solid cup. fun staff,interesting atmosphere,lots of things to potentially ruin if you spilled.delish doughnut & amaze honey latte. 100% hit the spot. really nice staff too, i can't stand pretentious baristas, and you won't find them here. i'm super excited for their logan sq location so i can hit it up dailyi love the wormhole! i've been trying out new coffee shops all over chicago, and i always find myself back here when in wicker park. i don't know the name of this particular barista but he wears headbands, fun glasses, and is always singing. he makes ordering coffee an experience and makes bad ass designs in my cup.this place is popular so you won't always get a seat (mostly on the weekend) depending on the time of the day, but it's really artsy, and has a cool vibe. you can play super mario on the couch, admire the delorean, or just have a nice time catching up on a good read. the coffee is strong, they have a great variety of drinks, and syrups/sauces made in house."i am going back to the 80s, looking at the ladies " -unknown."no, i do not look at anyone there while i eat, i am seen as the gay dude even though i am an asexual.. so, ha.. but anyways, why i put that quote up there? because once you get inside, you are taken to a time in which you do not remember, if you are the "average age" of a hipster, which is the customer base this coffee shop appeals to. most of the coffee and mocha and latte and etc. are served in small portions, however, it is more than enough to feel "full" after you finish it. i end up ordering whichever pastry is available on the glass counter next to where you pay. and it is worth getting, if you want something along with your drink. the appeal of this coffee shop is how it has memorabilia from the 80s, things that give out memories of pop culture from that decade. note that this shop is small, every time i enter it is almost at full-capacity, but that is because of its popularity. as well as there are bar stools that are quite okay, but for me they are uncomfortable since these are probably meant for tall people, i just sit on it anyways. so no complaints. summary: i definitely recommend, since i tend to appreciate small and local businesses whenever i can,  since starbucks and the like does become boring if you go there a lot.get the honey bear latte. one of the best i've had in ages! the couches are nice and it's always crowded. the teas are nice toothis is a quirky place! really good tea and coffee, i suggest stopping in for a drink.this was one of the first coffee shops that i visited after i had moved from washington, dc, where starbucks pervaded. wormhole could be considered a quintessential coffee shop, in my opinion, replete with big tables, couches, and chairs rather than small patio tables for two and wooden chairs.  wormhole serves really good coffee and offers to make a cup in a number of ways from aero press to french press. they take their coffee making very seriously. the pastries are on the pricey side and only taste average. wormhole has a good selection of coffee related products for sale, such as gooseneck kettles, tea diffusers, etc. even though wormhole is located in wicker park, which is teeming with hipsters everywhere, i can usually find a place to sit when i go which has been at different times during the weekday and weekend.i may have died and gone to 80's nerd heaven! we stopped in here while waiting for brunch at bongo room - what a great way to kill time. it's awesome. the drinks were all excellent - mine was most amazing... the peanut butter koopa-troopa. pb and chocolate mocha. mmmmm.the decor is 80's pop culture - including a back to the future style delorean, old mac computer and a tmnt.add in friendly staff and this place is perfect.while i don't drink much coffee, i stopped in here with a buddy before a long day in the city. he reassured me that even if i don't like coffee, i will love the peanut butter koopa trooper. i couldn't pass up on such an awesomly nostalgic name like that. the coffee was delicious, and it was a great start to a long day.the atmosphere is hipster and nostalgic. they have old posters, action figures, toys and even a delorean on display. their menu board is decorated with classic video game artwork, and they use an ipad as their register. there is an nes in the back, but it is has always been occupied when i have been there. if you enjoy coffee or just want a neat place to kill an hour or two, i would recommend the wormhole.aside from the cool, step back in time this place is, you must try their peanut butterkoopa troopa. omg!!!!!!!!!!!if you love peanut butter... if you love coffee... if you love lattes...you'll love it!!reviews brought me here, and i wasn't disappointed. i had the cool but rude latte, and it was incredible. the curry was spicy, not too overpowering, and there was honey too i think? highly recommend.wormhole offers a variety of pastries and drinks that are very tasty. i always order a black cold brew with easy ice no matter how cold it is outside or what coffee shop i end up at. wormhole hands down has one of the best cold brew coffees that i have tried. i savored and enjoyed every sip of it. the coffee was smooth and delicious. one friend that i came with ordered the bedrock and peanut koopa troopa, while the other one ordered the honey bear latte. i had some of both of the drinks and pleasantly enjoyed both of them. ambiance a+ hipster 80s chic overall, i had a really great experience. great food and drinks, cool ambiance, wonderful customer service and delorean! haha. will be coming back again.i was really excited to check out the wormhole since i wanted to play super mario on their nes and check out the delorean.  so, my boyfriend and i stopped by saturday afternoon after attending a cooking class in the area.first of all, it was packed and there weren't any places for us to sit.  this turned out to be a good thing since the ambiance was way too hipster for us.  i did enjoy the look to the place and that they were playing old school rap music.  "work it" by missy elliott was playing when i got in and i chuckled at the sight of hipsters rocking out to it.  i didn't think a place like that would play that kind of music.  but, i digress...as for the beverages, i went with the iced koopa troppa, which is a latte with just the right hint of peanut butter mousse.  i liked the little bits of peanut butter crunch that i tasted while drinking it.  my boyfriend got an espresso, which he had to drink in store since they don't offer it to go.  he enjoyed it as well.overall, the coffee was good, but i wasn't digging the atmosphere.  i'm glad i got to try it, but i'm not rushing back anytime soon.nothing significant to add. great coffee, great hangout spot. who doesn't want to sip & study with a delorean dangling above their head and a nintendo at their fingertips?ladies if you take your hipster/artsy/comic-loving geeky guy here he will respect you forever. great coffee, quirky/artsy atmosphere. you find a lot of creative types in here which always inspires me, so you can find me writing in here from time to time- got to love unlimited wireless w/ purchase. also they always make a foam heart in my latte, that makes me really happy.my friends and i snuck in here to grab a pick-me-up after stuff eating our weight in sushi. my friend ended up getting the honey bear latte and it tasted great. the latte art was a great touch!the interior of wormhole coffee is awesome...it has a futuristic-vintage feel to if that makes any sense. if i lived closer i could totally see myself coming here to grab a cup o coffee while studying. hit it up!came here while we were waiting for a table at umami burger. the ambiance was eclectic and neat. we ended up just playing mario in the back. i felt like perhaps, there were less than 15 people when we arrived, however finding seating was incredibly difficult. i wouldn't recommend it for a large group (by large i mean, 3 or more) trying to catch up over coffee. the cappuccino was average. and my ginger tea was good. i almost wish they would have brought the drinks out to us. because balancing that tea strainer contraption was a little scary.it is a cool spot. not sure if i'll be back.with all the 80's stuff going on here, my favorite has to be the old school tv with some super mario brothers 3.  brings back memories, except i only had a nintendo and  a tv where you had to change the channels with pliers.  with comfy couches and a stack of nes games, i liked this place right away.  they had 80's music, posters, and even the back to the future delorean.  they also have large communial tables, with plenty of people enjoying the free wifi on their macbooks.  i liked the couch area and had a blast playing some super nintendo.great metropolis coffee and i think i saw some pie from hoosier mama.  i happened to go on the day of their 1 year anniversary, so they had complimentary mini cupcakes fritz pastry had sent over.  great lattes and an awesome place to enjoy it.the wormhole is the sort of place that belongs in wicker park. very hipster.the environment is fun- lots of places to sit, video game posters on the wall, delightfully nerdy.  i ordered an espresso macchiato (current drink of choice), and they told me that my drink couldn't be taken to go. they said that the paper cup ruined the taste of the drink. i thought that was a little bit different, but i enjoyed drinking my drink inside and people watching.they have plenty of other to go options for those who can't stay.they weren't as fast as many of the coffeehouses i've been to, but they made everything specially by hand with awesome latte art. i would go back.this is my friend's favorite coffee spot - she's obsessed, and finally took me there today. i admit i'm not a big coffee drinker unfortunately - not because i don't enjoy it but i pretty much am guaranteed an upset stomach when i drink it. their menu was tempting though - specialty lattes like honey bear and peanut butter chocolate wooed me in, along with the mainstays. but i spotted the hot cocoa and felt safe with that.and the mark of a sophisticated coffee spot is not just when they pour the milk in art shaped le1aves or designs on their lattes, but when they do the same thing on their hot chocolate! my hot cocoa came with latte art - yes, they literally won me over with their latte art heart. i'll post a picture later.i liked my hot cocoa so much i just needed to try a sip of the coffee too because that was their specialty. i risked an upset stomach and had a sip of my friend's vanilla latte - it was delicious - complexly balanced and also donned a pretty topping. i would definitely recommend this place!my now-girlfriend and i came here for a hot chocolate "nightcap" after our first date. wormhole was basically first date, pt. 2. the dinner was a more serious setting, so it felt perfect to come to more fun, laid-back place where we both felt completely at ease. i thought the nerdy 80's centric theme of everything was really cool. the delorean was clearly the standout, which is mentioned in most reviews here (and rightly so). i definitely nerded out a bit, which is probably for the best, because i didn't scare my date away. heh. we had some trouble finding a place to sit. at ~8:30 pm on a weekday evening it was really packed with hipsters and their various idevices. we were lucky enough to get a spot on a couch near a bunch of nerdy comic books, so we enjoyed reading those long after the atmosphere is fairly loud, so we had some trouble carrying on a conversation. it seems a little weird to me that the music is pretty loud because it seemed like the vast majority of people there were there to get work done (not to play video games, which are available toward the back, or read comics, like us). that being said, this place is near and dear to my heart. also, the character is very "wicker park," for what that's worth.not sure what the hype is about this place. the coffee tastes burnt, similar to starbucks. their honey bear latte, which i kept hearing is one of the more popular lattes, is meh. the decor is cool. but that's about it!i read the wormhole coffee logo in a sticker:  wooo whoa wooo whoaunique drink on chicagoland:  tomahawk -- matcha latte with spice (feel the kick at the back of your throat or tonsil).think of a cross between the cantina in star wars and the tavern on battlestar galactica. they serve metropolis roasted coffee and they do it very very well. i have to admit that they serve the best tasting cappuccino i have ever tasted in my life. no shit!all the other stuff like the delorean and the star wars memorabilia and shit is all cool. it's not really a place to kick back and chill because everyone is just wired out of their minds on java and bits & bytes. it is straight out of the matrix.i love this place and so will you.enjoytried cocoa($2.5 8oz) and vanilla latte($4.0 8oz).  the 12oz one is $0.5 extra.they have punch card. one free cup after 10 drinks. will try the peanut butter one next time.both tasted great. look very classy with the latte art !price on the menu included tax. they let you choose tip option(15% 18% 20% or none)when pay with credit card...everything 80s. back to the future replica delorean. lockers. old console games. drinks with names like the koopatroopa (my favorite, it would be called the buckeye back home). castle greyskull. hey, look, almond, coconut and rice milk as options! because this isn't starbucks or ohio. i come here just about every visit to chicago. so should you.i just got coffee. the coffee was good, not exceptional, but good. the chairs are comfy to lounge around in. they've got some books you can thumb through.if i were a worm looking to drink some bomb caffeinated drinks surrounded by hipsters and nonhipsters (me) alike, this is the wormhole i'd crawl through. so cool. feels almost like a time machine. old school lunchboxes adorning one wall, a race car resting atop the loft on another, and a small niche in the cafe devoted to a nintendo. nintendo! seats are abundant with sofas, bar seats, window seats, and table seats, so whatever your looking to do while there is accommodated to! i first tried the pb koopa troopa hot, and it was as yummy as it was instagrammabley pretty #latteart. later on during my study sesh i tried the iced chai latte per the baristas recommendation. yum. tasted like horchata. so all in all, this place was a win. definitely check it out. if not for the fun atmosphere and great drinks, at least for the free wifi with a cute wifi password! enjoyyyy!try the "cool but rude" ginger/curry latte. fantastically delicious, not rude at all.so good! such a cool spot.  the quality of coffee was amazing, and the food options were delightful.this place is the worst. while filter cafe was closed for two weeks i had to go to wormhole, as it was basically the only cafe that was open late (past 7 pm when i get off work). i've been there about 10 times.almost every time you go in about 90-95% of people are quietly studying/working. when i was there, there were about 50 people in the cafe and only 4 werent working quietly. however the staff insist upon blasting music at a ridiculous level. if everyone is just here to work, for whose benefit are you playing music abnoxiously loud, other than your own??every time i come in this is the case. i wear bose noise cancelling headphones and have my volume up to 80% on a heavy noise "blizzard" track on repeat to block noise. however i can still hear mystikals "shake ya ass" blaring loud and clear the whole way through. i had asked a staff member once if they could  turn down the music and they looked at me for a while then said ...sure.. they turned the music down about 5% and before i had returned to my seat they turned it back up. when i asked a second time and pointed out nearly everyone was quietly studying, she did the same thing. when i sat back down she was whispering to get coworker who was looking at me and started laughing.the staff here have an outwardly snide attitude towards customers. they smile at you while they turn their ipad asking for a tip, but then glare at you if you leave your coffee on the bar for more than a minute when it's ready (because you have to crank the volume on your iphone to cancel their music).i would only come to this place as a last resort.. when nothing else is open.how cool is this place? great prices on coffee ($3 for a pint of cold brew), with a wonderful outdoor area, and ample space to chill inside. but perhaps the best part was the great staff, so quick and knowledgable. the barista with the awesome beard gave me tons of tips for the best places in the area on top of my order. i didn't catch your name, but thanks so much for the great experience!friendly staff, awesome honey latte, free wifi, and lots of seating. what more could you ask for from a coffee shop? how about charming 80s/90s decor (sounds gimmicky but it's sincere in its geekiness) and smashing pumpkins' adore album playing on the sound system? swoon.really great coffee place! for me, coffee is more of an art, and this place deliver it just right. i wish there is more selection of the danish, but if you come here for the coffee and hang out. this is a pretty cool place, it has upstair, small patio and the main room itself. one of my fav to go for sure!i went here for the first time and loved it! prices are reasonable, and there are plenty of seats and outlets to plug in your computer. if you come often, you can get a punch card and earn a free drink after 10 purchases.came here to charge my phone...hey! don't judge me, haha.buy seriously, this place is pretty cool. i totally dig the retro-nostalgia theme they've got going on. is that a delorean i spot in the back? overall, the ambiance is pretty chill, very quiet. there's limited seating though. i had to squeeze myself over by the door in order to find a spot with a working outlet, so i wouldn't recommend groups coming here. their drink selections sound interesting, so if i come back i'll definitely have to try them out.4.5 starsit's a pretty hip place in hip town.carries adequate quality of coffee and good chai latte.their macaron's huge (literally), but tastes good too.ambience is great for casual reading and studying.they also have nintendo on the back which is available to everyone.overall, a great place to either sit down, relax or study.oh btw free wifi.solid space as far as decor goes, nice throwback to the 80's. delorean/delorean replica hangs over the back wall. old school tube tv in the back area where you can play super nintendo video games.i've never had any troubles and every employee has always been super friendly and engaging. if you're having trouble deciding/figuring out your way, just ask for a recommendation. the honey bear latte is my favorite and a good go to unless you want just black coffee. they brew half wit but i don't drink much coffee just straight black so i couldn't touch on that. go in and see for yourself?looking for the wifi password? hunt down the floppy disks which are usually near the drink hand off point at the espresso bar, the wifi password printed on them.i don't live in the neighborhood but i find myself making the trip for a honey bear latte (the koopa troopa is also a great choice). i love the couches and the laid back atmosphere. one of my favorite coffee shops in chicago.love it, very busy always, there is outdoor seating on the street. the coffee is good. the whole nighbourhood is real artsy and fun. invites to a stroll.this is the best coffee shop in chicago, and i've been to a lot of coffee shops in chicago. they are one of the only shops in the city that is open late(ish) and i lived in wicker park for a year so i went pretty regularly. they have the best hot chocolate in the city and they use rishi chai concentrate so it's also very good. they also have cereal, how cool is that?? they are unsurprisingly busy on the weekends but it's never too hard to find a seat on week nights. it's been my go to for homework and just hanging out, i love it!love the 80s theme of the place, and the fact that they serve halfwit, which i haven't been able to come across too often in the city. its got great coffee, and is a great place to recharge when you need to.cool place with an intentional and kitschy 80's/90's pop culture theme. good coffee and specialty drinks. they have essentially every brewing method for whatever mid you're in.  you won't be disappointed. never actually been able to sit here since it's always jammed with the macbook pro crowd... a delorean replica on display for the win.been here twice and have got the vanilla bean latte each time and just love it. can't wait to go back again!the guy to gal ratio was definitely in favor of the girl. it was chilly out so i forgone my ushe iced americano for a vanilla bean latte art bevie.no artificial vanilla flavored syrup here. vanilla bean infused whatever. it had the right amount of vanilla but i loved that i could still taste the coffee flavor. wifi. seating and outlets galore. my suggestion, post up on the couch in the corner and chill with et while charging up your phone so you can phone home. if your friends are along, you can play a game of mario bros on nintendo. truth.this place is adorable and has a great vibe. the coffee isn't the best and the pastries were kind of stale, but honestly, it just seems like you should expect that when you're entering a time portal to the early 90s. i mean that in a good way.from the second you walk in, this place screams fun. from the proudly displayed delorian, to the eclectic (and surprisingly large) collection of gizmo stuffed animals (seriously, where did they get all the gremlins?), it seems a quirky place to enjoy a cup of coffee. one look at the menu (a drink that boasts fruity pebbles syrup!) and a glance at the pastry case (a donut topped with cereal!) seems to seal the deal. sadly, that's where the fun ends. after reading the description for the 'bedrock' (espresso, cereal milk, with fruity pebbles syrup over ice), i knew i had to have it. i ordered it with a smile (because how can one not smile when ordering a drink called 'bedrock'), which was not only not reciprocated by the guy behind the counter, but which i'm pretty sure was shot down by the daggers his eyes were throwing my way. i mean, not that i'm expecting to become best friends with the guy taking my coffee order, but at the very least, i feel like he should somewhat embody the happy atmosphere. and just in case the guy was having a bad day, i visited a second time - same results. on a good note -- they serve french macarons, which were quite tasty! the 'sprinkle' variety was a fun departure from the more traditional flavors, and the pistachio (though oddly bright green) was delicious.all in all, i do enjoy their coffee and treats - but try to make it a grab-and-go type of operation.this is a really neat coffee shop in the heart of wicker park.  if you're in your 20s or older, you'll feel right at home since the shop is decorated in 80s and 90s décor (e.g.  delorean, furbys, e.t., nintendos, etc).  their menu is written on two little chalk boards hanging from the ceiling and they have just the right amount of drink options.  i'll keep it short since there are already a ton of reviews but i will be another sucker to tell you to order the peanut butter koopa troopa.  it is divine!  this drink has the perfect peanut butter to coffee ratio where you can taste the yummy pb but without it overwhelming the whole drink.  the line was decently long but that's to be expected at a neat coffee spot like this, but the baristas were fairly quick and i didn't have to wait long for my drink.  check this place out and then go down the street and shop!  i love stopping by at mojo spa for handmade, natural bath products/makeup or pitaya for some cute, trendy clothesi adore this place.  my favorite coffeeshop in the neighborhood, and it's open late (til 11!) while everywhere else closes around between 7-9.  chock full of hipsters, which makes me love it even more (i'm trying to be a hipster, which i think is sort of missing the point.  oh well).  i like sitting at the bar or one of the tables and working, though when it's really too full i just walk down the street to filter.love the music, love the delorean (c'mon, people, get it together and recognize), love the calvin and hobbes in the bathrooms and the octopussy poster in spanish.  i'm surprised no one has written about the tea.  they take their tea seriously.  (obviously coffee as well, though i'm not a regular drinker).  like, we need to brew this shit for exactly 4 minutes and we will call you when it's ready serious.  and they have an incredible selection of teas.  i like the scarlet, and some of the chinese name ones that i can't remember because they're in chinese.  i loved the invisible touch drink during the summer too, which they only made in-house and not for to go orders.  can't wait for next summer to have it again!  cucumber soda, rosewater foam, lemon somewhere in there too.  so yummy!also they make giant oreos which are pretty good.oh, this place made me ache.  i may have been kneeling on the floor w/my hands cupping my face, hiding a tear, as i marveled at what was displayed before me.  may have.   but please.  i ain't no pansy.  i'm hard.  see this right here? *punches chest twice.  hard.who you tryin to be, wormhole?  huh?  tryin to play the nostalgic card w/me. please.then i saw it.      a delorean.  from back to the future.  in this coffee

backwards. i.may.faint.  you could do this.  relax.their drink menu went like this:rank - level - coin(drink - size - price)*losin itthey brew san francisco's own ritual & sightglass coffee here.  they also serve cereal like cocoa puffs, apple jacks, lucky charms, kix, & corn pops.  *heads to bathroom. dry heaveswell done, wormhole.  well done.p.s.  yes, this joint is flooded with hipsters.  who gives a flying fck, deal with it.cool spot for an 80's kid.  good coffee.  the end.milwaukee ave has to many places for coffe but the warmhole is something else. the latte is amazing.thanks wormhole, now i can't enjoy starbucks or any other odd place i used to go.this place is like everything from my childhood bedroom in 1989. complete with calvin and hobbes books, classic nintendo on a tube tv. the delorean is awesome (it even has mr fusion) and the walls and coasters are full of pixelated nes/snes goodness, vintage posters and a flux capacitor. its everything that a 30 something misses about his childhood plus coffee. they also have some awesome t-shirts. how could i not buy my wife boba fett as a kitten t-shirt and buy myself a tiled pixelated 8-bit map of the cafe in zelda/final fantasy 1 style graphics!?as for the vibe, i want to start by saying i'm not a "hipster" as some people reviewing this place are calling the clientele and staff. i'm just am adult nerd who enjoys music and classic gaming. i have no tatoos, vintage clothes, beard or anything else associated with that label. the staff here has always been super nice to me and never made me feel unwelcome. in fact, everyone in wicker park has always been very civil and freindly. i really don't understand all the derision and negativity so many people have about it.i have been here two times and the experience was a bit different both times. the first, on a sunday night. the staff was nice and freindly, but the clientele were all folks firmly ensconced in their laptops and headphones, there was some droning music that sort of made the whole place feel kind of dark and erie. we felt like we were intruding on a private space by having a normal-volume conversation. we got a few sideways looks from those who were obviously annoyed by our presence. no one said anything, no one glared, but we obviously were kind of disrupting the vibe. the staff however was very nice and the coffees were amazing. i had a conversation with one of the workers about identifying all the 8-bit characters on the wall (he was impressed i recognized ed). overall, we felt like those there were tolerant of us, but that it wasn't a place to have a conversation. clearly, its a great place to come to work on your laptop, read a book or just chill. the layout of where the tv is makes it hard to get to the video games as usually the couch seats are taken by someone on a laptop already. we had to wait about 30 minutes to get in there and play. later, i returned with my wife on a tuesday night. the place was lively and more like a normal coffee house environment, the music was indie electronic fare and some 90s rock. the staff was joking with us and smiling and we could talk at a normal volume without disturbing anyone. we were able to get over to the tv this time and play some dr mario and tmnt on the old nes. although we felt slightly self-concious with some spectators watching our game, the couches were super comfy and we had a fun time. the honey bear latte and the peanut butter koopa troopa were amazing.damn fine place to get that caffeine up in your blood stream, nahmean?i sat next to a nuclear physicist and drank a peanut butter chocolate coffee drink. free wifi, comfy couches, and they gave away a free coffee drink while i was sitting there doing "work". i love this neighborhood on rainy crappy days cuz i can nestle into a place like this and be working. seems like it would be a little on the pretentious side, but not evenif you want to get transported back in time when all things were peaches and apple sauce then you must go to the wormhole. you're surrounded by 80's-90's memorabilia: super mario bros, ghostbusters, back ii the future, etc. on top of that they make a great cup of joe.my friend and i stopped in before we ate at the bongo room since we were itching for a cup of coffee to start our day. we kinda just stumbled upon it and i'm so glad we did. it's a very cool place to just sit down and admire all the stuff that reminds you of your childhood (well, mine at least - i'm an 80's baby!). they've got some interesting coffee drinks that are actually pretty tasty and they do a design with the cream and foam on top. very neato!good coffee and a blast from the past? that's a winner in my book.i really enjoyed my homemade vanilla bean latte! it had a fun special swirl in it too, which always impresses me :)this was my first time at wormhole and it is sort of dark inside! the music is at a good level though sometimes a little loud.i enjoyed the ambiance and there are several  seating areas with couches and tables as well as a bar area. would be great spot to meet with friends or work alone. i will definitely be back!been here three times already and it never fails to satisfy me. the coffee is great, the place is cool as hell and it's relaxing.the coffee is fine. the room is really cool, themed to 80's video game and science fiction. lots of great movie posters and original art. there's a millenium falcon mounted on the wall and holy shit look at the delorean! i don't know where you find a full size back to the future replica delorean for your coffee shop, maybe skymall, but there it is. that is impressive. worth visiting if you're in the neighborhood, spotless bathrooms, four stars.i'm definitely a child of the 80's.  my dream car: the beetle.  my favorite movie: pretty in pink.  my first dance song at my wedding:  starship's "nothing's gonna stop us now."  so needless to say it was love at first sight of the delorean.love the 80's movie posters plastered on the walls. i'll be searching for the breakfast club and indiana jones on netflix, asap!  remember the old nintendo nes system?  they've actually got one here that you're allowed to play!  holy crap!  how awesome is that?!  my current drink of choice is the chai latte.  $3 here offered in 8 or 13 oz.  not to spicy but hit the spot on a cold october afternoon.  they've got a small selection of pastries and pre-packaged sandwiches in addition to their caffeinated beverages. this is the kind of coffee joint that makes me want to go to school again...just so i can study & drink my caffeine in a chill 80's themed space. it's truly student friendly.  on weekday afternoons, you'll see mac book after mac book littering the coffee tables with quiet, mild mannered students (we kinda felt guilty for chatting away).  free wi-fi is available with the username and password posted on small while laminated cards on the coffee tables.  there are also ample electrical outlets throughout, just push that teenage mutant ninja turtle doll to the side...you'll find it!back when i was doing the online dating thing there was nothing i liked less than a coffee date.  i generally find the atmosphere awkward - as if you're trying to spark a romantic connection in someone's home office.  so when a boy i'd been exchanging messages online invited me to the wormhole, i was unsure.however, i wound up being pleasantly surprised.  the coffee at wormhole is delicious (i'm a huge fan of the vanilla bean latte.  the flavor is exceptionally well balanced.) and the atmosphere is awesome.  the 1980's vibe feels effortless and like a perfect fit for the neighborhood.  it's also a great place to lounge on a couch (or at the sidewalk tables when the weather is warmer) with a coffee and catch up with someone or read a book.and a year and a half later that boy is now my boyfriend and we are happily together so there seems to be something in the coffee here.one of the coolest places i've been to in a while. i don't know what else to say. it's an homage to the 80's nerd. delorean chilling in the back. nintendo with many games also located in the back. excellent themed drinks and my favorite part was the paintings and pictures of classic movies. aliens. gizmo from gremlins on a portrait?! i'm convinced that the wormhole is the coolest place i've ever purchased a beverage in bar or coffee shop!i almost chumped out and went to some random cafe this morning, but i have been reading reviews for this place for my whole weeklong vacation and decided towalk the extra mile for seething special for my last day. it paid off. i asked the friendly barista for something interesting but not too serious of a calorie bomb and she suggested the honey bear latte. it is delicious!! so foamy, so beautiful, and really unique! a guy who i believe to be the owner told me it's honey from a guy in indiana who keeps his bees around blueberry bushes. other things of note-- they sell the equipment to do your own pour overs, the music is really good, plenty of seating, outdoor patio, and lots of delicious looking treats and cereal! they even have a vegan twinkie, which is so tempting as i love the vegan treats, but ya know a vegan twinke is still a twinkie. long story short, go here. it's cool.fire up the delorean, baby - where we're going, we don't need cupholders.that's because your coffee will be gone before you even have the fluxx capacitor twitching.  whether it features peanut butter and nutella, has a homemade marshmallow with cracked pepper on top (yes really), or just contains a steamy cup of tea courtesy of the biggest tea bag i've ever seen, your drink will be gone in a flash.  but don't hurry out - the cheerful kitsch of the decor will make you want to hang out in this coffee shop all day, should you be lucky enough to get a seat in the first place.definitely worth a journey across the city/time-space continuum.the atmosphere was good enough to demand another shot, and while i still didn't like the coffee very much (i'm strictly a black coffee drinker), i realized there are other reasons to go to the wormhole.i think they may just be more of a specialty drink shop. i tried some of my friends vanilla bean latte and that was amazing. the oatmeal cookie was also delicious, and the nes in the back with a slew of games is cause enough to visit this establishment.the ambiance is awesome, delorean in the back, star wars figurines all around, and end table shaped like star trek comm badges. if you're a pc person, just a heads up there were 12 macs and 0 pcs being used by customers when we walked in, which was funny because it couldn't have been more predicable.in the end, the wormhole won't ever be a regular coffee stop for me, but as an occasional hangout where i can reminisce, it'll do.one of the best places in chicago for coffee. for me literally the best mocha in the world - not too sweet and without cream is just perfect. you can find good tea here too.super crowded and super hipster. pretty cool coffee shop overall. the place is 80's themed and plastered with lots of classic movie posters. not necessarily my place of choice to get work done, you'll most likely have to fight for a seat here. but the staff is friendly and seem to love what they're doing, and the music is always catchy and fun.my only gripe with this place is the coffee. it's good but i prefer my coffee hot as hades. it's served hot enough to drink immediately without blowing on it. i tend to be a slow drinker so having my coffee cool down faster is not preferable.definitely the hipster establishment in the neighborhood. can't think of anything more quintessentially hip in a neighborhood that is fast losing that title. but who cares?the coffee here is outstanding and that is a true testament given the insane high quality in the surrounding area. their selection is quite possibly the most varied in the city. the space itself is fun and inviting and definitely a good mix of people typing away, others chatting about nothing, others people watching, and everything in between.good pastries here as well!more important, the service here is great. people here don't act stuck up like your average hipster, they are pretty welcoming and the staff runs the joint like a well-oiled machine.only reason i give it four stars and not five is that the prices are a tad high but nothing out of the ordinary with any other high caliber coffee shop. it's also just a tad crowded. the place reminds me a lot of the now closed tea lounge in park slope, brooklyn if that gives you a sense of how crowded the spot is.i'll most certainly be back.$2.75 for an espresso machiato?  while a little pricey, the drink was damn good.  no to go cups either for espresso, but like the italians, sometimes its just better to drink and go.  the barrista also tried to make a heart design for me but it ended up looking like a large ass.  i didn't mind though b/c i like large asses.  practice makes perfect and they are off to a good start.  in reality its too early to judge the place.  the decor is certainly unique, and the delorean is cool.  i'm also sort of excited to play old atari games.  i'll definitely stop back in, mainly because of how good the espresso was.  they get extra credit for the mini wafer that was served with the espresso.  there should always be a side cookie or chocolate when you get an espresso.  good start wormhole!i joined yelp just to write this review of wormhole. i do, though, strongly recommend that you not base your opinions of places purely on anyone's yelp review. yelp is full of babies and i am one of them.  i crawl my whiny morning baby self into the wormhole several days a week. i'm often the first customer of the day and they are facing a customer who cannot speak before caffeine.  i  merely grunt and point to muffins in cases and cappuccino sizes on boards. they accept my mumbles and determine my needs. i nestle into a bar seat and await the perfect single cappuccino, served in a baby blue cup and saucer with a side of tiny cookie bears. yes. bears!then i get another one to go...because its just so very good. and because they care, every morning, that it tastes amazing. because they know its important to me. it starts my day. much is made of the whimsy of the décor and the retro vibe. that's all great and really, it is quite charming but the thing that makes me loyal is that they are truly passionate about coffee. there are times when the coffee has made me cry. because its so very lovely. okay, now i can retire from yelp.attention vegans: wormhole makes the best soy mocha you'll ever have in your life. pair it with one of their many vegan pastries. your tastebuds will thank you.my wicker park mecca, i love coming here to write papers and study.  try the honey bear latte, it's to die for, and i've never had a bad pastry here.  there's lots of comfy seating, though it can get a little crowded.  the decor is awesome--totally unique and wonderful.really fun shop with a really fun vibe! love all the nerdy stuff they have up and the drinks there are delicious! i've tried the ginger curry latte sounds weird but was so good! i would definitely recommend it! we also tried the peanut butter mocha, which was also good.my only complaint is that is so full of people that there is no where to sit down! and everyone is on their computers so you don't get to play with any of the throwback video games they have.eh, i am torn.i've been here a bunch of times because i live nearby. this place has gone downhill the past year. the pastries are great but sometimes there are fruit flies in the glass, come on guys gross. also you never know which jekyll and hyde personality your are going to get out of the baristas. some are so sweet others are in another universe and not in a good way. coffee is solid and it's a pretty cool spot to hang out for an hour. lacks consistency and therefore a risky choice.really great decor and vibe that make the place worth a stop if you're in the area, but the espresso itself is not good. they consistently produce coffee that tastes like lemon peels. i love flavorful espressos, but this is a roasting error. espresso should be bright but not overwhelming. the decoration is sort of 1970s nostalgic, and it's fairly quiet, making it a good place to study or relax. the baristas are nice and the spirit of the place fits well with the vintage stores and bookshops in the same area.coffee: i don't even have time to talk about this, but i will say that even for drip coffee, they will do that fancy thing where they warm the cup with hot water first so the coffee doesn't cool at all from touching cold ceramic. just imagine that amount of quality and care administered to drinks much nicer and more complicated to prepare than drip coffee.food: i had a chocolate muffin from there yesterday. i wrote a letter to my mom about it.staff: they're all that one kid from high school who was both unbelievably cool but also friend to anybody they came in contact with. they are all beautiful. bathroom: the bathroom is super nice! they keep the extra toilet paper rolls in there on a shelf and i thought about taking one, but this place is the best and i would never do that to them.music: the music is a wonderful mix that appeals to just about anyone who has the same music taste as you and me, and is always always played at the exact appropriate volume. having had to sleep next to a hot water heater that was incredibly loud, i would say that this is not as loud as that. not even close. atmosphere: eclectic decoration, but not in that tries-too-hard kind of way like that one friend you have who totally tries too hard. there's usually lots of people, but not like 1am at a lincoln park mcdonald's or anything crazy. they have cool mugs, and there's recycling and compost options for throwing your stuff away. classy as fuck.i really wanted to pan this place.... all of my friends go on and on and on about this place like it's the coolest coffee shop in the world.  i had to try it.  my friends were right -- it rocks.  old school stuff, good drinks and a sweet atmosphere.  highly recommend.a great cafe in hipster central. you know, grungy, dark basement kind of feel. i personally have to be in the mood to come to cafes like this---so maybe throw on a dress and boots ladies, or grow a beard boyz. regardless of the hipster ambiance, it is an awesome place to study given their free wi-fi, plenty of couches,long tables, and plentyyyy of outlets! they also outdoor seating too which is awesome. cool decorations too--- vintage car mounted on the wall, old school lunch boxes, and other random decor.quality coffee, this is not starbucks kidz. with the higher quality comes a slightly higher price tag (8 oz. honey bear latte $4, 8 oz. specialty drinks $4.25). nonetheless, the latte was divineee and the corn blueberry muffin was a nom bomb. note: you can barely tell it's a cafe from the outside--as i mentioned it's dark, and there is an obscure "wh" on the door--keep your eyes peeled or else you might it! =pokay i thought i'd really enjoy this place, however the coffee just wasn't great. my cortado taasted very smokey/ burnt. i didn't even finish it. the coffee house it's self was nice however, good vibes-- that's about it though.my only complaint with wormhole is that i wish they had more seating. but other than that, the pastries and coffee are on point.love the coffee hate the service.they probably have my favorite cup of coffee in chicago, i continue to go but man their baristas just get on my nerves. no smiles, bitch at customers, and take coffee snobbery to a whole new level.anyway good coffee, bad servicea cool spot for the tech nerd and the drink options are great. terrible seating situation thought and a difficult place to get any work done. prices are a little much as well.i could not agree more with matt b's review. i had an appointment in the area before a conference call for work. i came here based on the positive reviews. as i was paying my order, another customer asked them to turn down the music a notch. i was so thankful for the request, but i didn't notice much of a difference in volume. i took a seat closer to the door, as the sound seemed a little less obnoxious. thankfully, i was only on an internal call where i could listen on mute most of the time. i still missed some key takeaways from the call due to the noise. so don't come here looking for a quiet place to work or take a call.the peanut butter koopa troopa was very good and different from your usual coffee drink, and it was topped with a beautiful leaf design, so i would give the drink 4 stars. just take it to go next time.   i would have happily ordered something from the pastry case, but nothing really appealed to me. the chocolate chip pretzel cookie looked over baked and hard. furthermore, i didn't see any chocolate chips! i passed.wormhole, you occupy a fond portion of my memory. sixteen ounce ethiopia chemex, on two occasions. i can't remember anything better.this place is great. obviously the fun decor lends itself to a perky atmosphere, and the coffee is delicious. i'd recommend the honey bear latte, it's absolutely superb. they also have a bottomless coffee option if you're staying for a while. at the counter, they have some standard pastries. every food item i've tried has been good but not overly impressive. the baristas have always been super nice, and definitely not standoffish or overly arrogant in a "hipster" way. they're very welcoming, as are most of the customers you run into here. i don't think anybody would feel uncomfortable. also, there's two bathrooms, and they're usually very clean. as for the study/work situation, if you're a person who needs quiet or a calm atmosphere, this is not the place for you. the music is too loud to drown out with headphones, and there's always tons people moving and talking and just generally being social. personally, i like all the background action, as it keeps me focused. if that's not for you though, i'd take the coffee to go and find somewhere quieter.i love this place but the music is so so bad, people are trying to get productive over here. also the lights are too dim for a cafe that consists mainly of people working rather than just hanging out to chill.what the hell is still love it and will keep coming!this was the coolest coffee shop i've ever been to. the 80s theming and music was incredible and the wicker park location makes it ten times better. the cappuccino i ordered was phenomenal as well. will definitely be visiting again.all you need to know about wormhole is that 1. it's iconic wicker park and you have to stop in to at least see the delorean2. coffee is good but the specialty drinks can get a tad pricy for the size3. most likely it will be crowded (especially weekends) 4. if you're on the fence about visiting just do it, you won't be disappointedthe moment you step inside the wormhole you can't help but be overwhelmed by the eclectic feel. from the back to the future delorean parked in the front window to the extensive lunchbox collection on display behind the register, there's some 80's memorabilia for everyone. i mean there's a classic nintendo for your gaming pleasure! there is also free wifi and tons of seating if you like to browse the web or do some studying while drinking your cup of joe. aside from the decor their loose tea was excellent, and the chai latte looked first rate. i haven't had the opportunity to explore the menu extensively, but in due time that will change. all in all i will be returning to the wormhole whenever i find myself in wicker park jonesin for a cup of tea and a game of mike tyson's punchout.cool but rude is my go to drink, i wanna try more but it's so good! great place to chill btw.i should have written a review on wormhole a long time ago but here goes. been coming here almost every week for the past 2 years. this place is definitely a great place to catch up on some reading or studying. i'm sure there are plenty of meetups at this place due to the high volume of customers. seriously, this place always gets packed after 3pm and don't even mention sundays when everyone is prepping for their upcoming school week. there are two long tables that seat 6 people, two couches which seat about an extra 6-8 people, 2 extra chairs, and about 5 stools next to the counter where the coffee magic happens. the baristas here are all down-to-earth and friendly. the interior is filled with movie and video game memorabilia. there's a nintendo in the back. the drinks hit the spot every single time and they're all reasonably priced. their most popular drinks are all priced between $4-$4.50. i only wish wormhole invested in more comfortable furniture and chairs to sit in. some of the couches feel as if you're being sucked right into them. also an extra table would help out with the crowds. other than the furniture, wormhole is seriously amazing.when i die, bury me with a 12oz koopa troopa.my favorite espresso drink is made here and only here.although i do like espresso shots from intelligentsia more, they don't make the koopa troopa. it combines the richness and crema-laced ecstasy of a great cup of latte with the texture and savoriness of chunky peanut butter, all while only hinting at a bit of sweetness -- oh my /takei.the ambiance:hipster. nintendo with super mario brothers 3. space invaders everywhere. trendy bears and mustaches; flannel/plaid; and very dapper hairstyles. everywhere. expect a lot of artists/writers showcasing their works in progress here.the drinks/food:i already prefaced with this, but their koopa troopa is amazing. i'm a big fan of combining sweet and savory, especially in drinks. the balance of flavor hits a high note the same way the maple bacon latte at pirate cat radio (in san francisco, ca) does. don't hate it 'til you try it.in terms of food, i've only had their lemon macaron (at $1, it's a steal). it wasn't fresh--the exterior was a little styrofoamy and stale, but the flavor was there. it was like a great lemon wafer filling. it's many steps down from other la/california-based macaron purveyors (lette and bouchon bakery come to mind), but those are priced 3x+ more than these $1 bad boys.the service:a little slow, but you're here for quality (assuming you're here for coffee and not just to be part of the hep crowd).this place is one of the reasons why i considered living in wicker park (that was a short 5 minutes, though).everything is good here, great ambiance, service and they have the best chai latte i have ever try! and in top of everything the are open until 11! perfect place to study! love it!favorite coffee place! love, love, love the vibe and their iced honey bear latte is fantastic!quaint and kitschy local business...it's always busy, right on milwaukee. great to chill and get some work done or just stop in and grab a coffee. seriously, skip starbucks. this is way better and starbucks is just stupid.what a cool place! love the futuristic decor and really good coffee! the baristas are very nice and we'll trained to make artisan coffee. if you can find a seat in this place it's well worth it to sit and chill.really love the 80s decor at this place, it's a lovely nostalgic context to enjoy a top-notch cup of brew. their flat whites are great, and i recommend the coconut macaroons.i love this place! love the ambiance, location, but most of all... love the staff, and the best coffee in the city, that is made and presented with love! this is the third time i come here with a friend or date, and its becoming my favorite place to kick back and spend some relaxing time. thanx guys!today is my birthday. and wormhole is the perfect place to go on your birthday (even better than chuck e. cheese's!) because the years fly off the second you walk through the door. no amount of peter pan, bumper cars, trampolines, hell, not even botox will make you feel as young as a full-size delorean, unlimited nintendo nes games and a tall glass of rocketsauce. i'm officially 9-years-old again. thanks, wormhole!(free) video games, outside seating, and comfy couches... these are a few of my favorite things! i ordered the homemade vanilla bean latte. seriously. delicious. the atmosphere is fun and inviting; the coffee is just as amazing. this was my first time at wh and i will definitely be back.nice coffee. friendly staff. stable wifi. also, i really enjoyed the retro nintendo corner. if you are in wicker park, swing by!i love the concept, and i loved their coffee!  i cannot remember what coffee i ordered, but it was delicious! it was a spiced coffee that reminded me a lot of a coffee version of a chai latte; it was probably that my drink had curry, cinnamon and ginger!finally had a chance to stop back in for a chai tea latte. i'm still not a fan, but i'm willing to up my rating based on the service this time around, although once again two out of the four people behind the counter were working and two were standing around having a conversation even though there were ten people either waiting to order or waiting for a drink, but at least i got my drink this time. chai is the only thing i order nowadays, so i pretty much use it to determine whether i will return to an establishment or not, and my final verdict is that if you want a trendy place to hang with your friends and wax poetic about the pre-internet 1980s (i lived through the reagan years - not my favorite decade!) then this is your place, but the chai just wasn't that great in my opinion, pricey for the size, and the service still leaves a lot to be desired. if you're looking for a place to work in peace while imbibing in your favorite drink or someplace to grab a quick caffeine fix on your way to work in the morning, i wouldn't recommend wh--too noisy, too crowded and too much dawdling going on.but hey! to each his own.great coffee. hot, iced, specialty drinks they're all good!employees always look like they're having a good time at work and there's always fun music playing.wish there was a little more room to sit, might not be the best place to go with a group depending on the day of the week and time. open a little late and if you can get the seats by the window really great for people watching. i thought the prices were fair especially for the quality of the coffee. it's good shitthe days of a coffeeshop being a smokey, lowly lit place filled with contemplative writers is gone. (single tear)kinda everything that you'd want a coffeeshop to be in 2014. 1. theme'd to the max. i'm frankly amazed at some of the corny sci-fi, star wars, and old nintendo (including an 8bit system you can play in the back!) stuff they have in there. the huge tile picture of all kinds of 8bit nintendo game characters is incredible.2. typical staff.they're just nice enough to not be rude, but aren't really too nice, either. they take themselves just seriously enough to borderline too serious, but not too serious. read it again and think about it, it makes sense.3. hilarious patrons.macbooks, everywhere. overflowing with 'artists,' who cannot stop talking about themselves.4. good drinks. the only way they make you decaf is as an americano, b/c obv, nobody orders that stuff. their specialty coffee drinks have great names and taste great as well.5. sweet things to eat.(mostly vegan, duh)6. the most incredible internet passwords ever.the only bad part is the lack of seating, most of the time. but, that's not bad for them. just me. and i'm ok with that. i'd so much rather have this than (another starbucks).this is my favorite cafe in all of chicago. it's not too hipster and it's not too "uppity." it has a idgaf/nerdy/nostalgic atmosphere. the people are chill and the music is great. they mix indie rock and good hip-hop. there's movie posters, art, video games, and the most comfortable chairs and sofas of any cafe. plus, they have a back to the future car inside!came here for a quick meeting with my boss for the summer. walking in, i immediately noticed the interesting sci-fi themed decor; the delorean model in the back is just too cool! there is also a super nintendo in the back for people to play, which i thought was pretty fun. the coffee was also above average compared to the more typical places around where i live (starbucks, argo, etc.)it was quite crowded at 5 p.m. on a wednesday (hardly any seats open) so i don't know if i'd come here if i had to get some serious studying done, but for the more casual work load, i'd give it a try!this is by far the best coffee shop i have been to. i'm not just talking about the quality of their drinks, it is filled head to toe from everything i love about being a geek. let's start off with their full size delorean replica to the posters adorning their walls depicting movies from top gun to the last starfighter. filled with memorabilia mainly from the star wars universe (heck my coffee came in a star tours mug!) including novels and board games to actual video game inspired pixelated tables! i just got a drip coffee and a macaroon, both were good enough to prove that wormhole actually knows a thing or 2 about coffee as well in addition to its way to every geek's heart. located in my favourite chicago neighbourhood wormhole could hardly do wrong and they have set the gold standard for other coffee shops aiming for sci fi themed to match.zoinks!  where's the beef?   autobots roll out!  i pity the fool!that's just a smattering of the 80s catch phrases you'll hear in this place.  this place is 80s to the max.  and by max i mean max headroom.  the only thing it lacks is mr. t making your frothy pac man latte.   keep in mind though, like everything in chicago with good reviews, this place gets super busy.  it's in wicker park so you probably know there will be a variety of young cool people there.  if you have someone with you, and they can scope out a spot and do seat recon, while you order for the both of you.  there's also some retro games in the back but we didn't get a chance to play with any of them.   now you know, and knowing is half the battle.if i were a hipster hunter....this would be my stomping ground....great space....no crazy decorations.....just a huge deloreon parked in front....i actually have been back a few times....really cozyfriendly service. delicious & creative coffees. ambiance was very chill. it was a little dark in there, but i love that about this place.good coffee.smelly customers.good sweet treats.nasty used couches.good bathroom.horrible customer line.good decor.no luck getting a seat because people camp out here all day.as you can see, i'm really torn about the place.  if it's not busy and i'm looking for a coffee on the go, i'll stop in and grab a cup.  if i want to chill for a few minutes and enjoy the scenery, this is not the place for me.overall, i'd give it 3.5 stars.apparently this is the hipster coffee bar to be at on rainy weekends.  line to the door and line of cups awaiting caffeine on the counter.  two baristas worked like a symphony to create and expedite drinks to the awaiting customers.it was really hard to find a place to sit and drink our coffee here.  there's a lot of wasted space that could be re-configured for seating but i'm not sure if we were just there on an unusually busy day.  the decor was fun and kept your eyes busy as you waited for your drink.  baristas/staff were friendly and when the drinks were ready, they were good (i had the honey bear and a friend had the pb one.... both tasted great).  i think i would give this place another try and it's definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area.  weekdays might be best though if you'd like a seat with your espresso!i think i loved this place as soon as i stepped in. companion cube lunch boxes? crocheted derpy hooves humping chrocheted rainbow dash? i'm in love.nerdiness aside, my friend and i were just stopping by, so i ordered the honey bear latte to-go. flavor was unique, which is often difficult to say about coffee. definitely tasted the honey element and something else, hard to put my finger on. overall it was enjoyable. i will be back!oh and i don't know about the men's restroom, but the women's is a treasure trove of amusing graffiti.i love this place. the decor brings back memories of growing up in the 80s: et, the muppets, indiana jones, gremlins, the goonies...they've got it all! the best part, besides the hot chocolate, is the vintage nintendo video game console and the old school television set. did i mention everything is in working order and you can play all of your favorite games (mario bros, duck hunt, joust, etc)? and if that's not enough for you, there's free wi-fi. definitely one of my new favorite coffee shops.this is a truly unique little coffee shop and one that i wish i could go to every day. if you're like me and a just want a cup of regular coffee, you will be happy to find they brew half-wit, and do so very well. the staff are generally great, and once gave me a free cup without having filled out a little punch card just because they saw me all the time. thanks!i always got a cup here on my way to the dog park and they even have treats by the door to reward your pup for hanging out on milwaukee while you duck in. a+!i have only been here once but i assure you that's going to change, i been looking for a new coffee shop since i given up on starbucks because their customer service sucks in all locations (at least in all 50+ locations i been to) any who back to wormhole this place is amazing, the decor is amazing, the people are nice and their selection of drinks is pretty good, again today was my first time there and i have made it my mission to try everything on their menu. today i had their harrison gourd and i am so glad i did, it was love at first bite (literally, they give you a small spoon and they suggest you eat it like you would ice cream). i will be back for another one. i also had their square donut, it was pretty good, nothing special but good enough to have again.i am glad i gave this place a try. i'll be back.i missed the rocketsauce!? it's true. i kid you not, within 2 days of my inaugural visit to wormhole i heard the infamous "rocketsauce" praised three separate times. three. i mean, really? from different social circles, random people, a colleague and a facebook post. the universe demands i right my ways. next stop, rocketsauce on the menu. noted. it's some concoction of fresh lime juice, tea and other magical things. i will find out more later. as for my journey...it was pretty much a dream come true start to finish. a quick yelp app search for "coffee that doesn't suck" (ok, "coffee") near mojo spa in wp led me here, and also it's been on my caffeine radar for quite some time. bonus: their note claiming "plenty of outlets and free wifi, come stay awhile." um, hell yeah. i hate the iffy feeling of not knowing when a place is worker bee friendly. major props to wormhole for walking the fine winner of: hip urban outpost working station with power, internets, coffee, and rocketsauce. oh, and a nice mix of folks...hipsters, of course, but also a friendly all-accepting vibe. hard to do. i digress. many heeded the call this particular friday so the house was a bit packed. ain't no thang, i jumped up to the bar near the espresso machine, hammered out an hour or so of work while sipping a wonderfully chilled iced coffee and was on my way. actually bounced on my way, that stuff was stacked. see reviews for the bangin' 80's decor and flashbacks. the deloreon is a sincere touch, and despite its girth is geekboy and geekgirl eyecandy indeed. nintendo!? why was this a work day!? i would've rocked that shit 'til close if given the chance. great coffee. great service. and, i'd def come back for that pre 9am mocha puffs bowl (free with beverage!). wow, these guys are just hitting it out of the park. i can get on board, most definitely. so cool, and without the pretense of another 80's themed coffee snops (snob shops).children of the 80's, welcome home. coffee's on.walking into this place is like walking into my childhood. yes, that dates me but its sooooo worth it. upon first glance, i was instantly transported. let's be clear... they have a delorean. the caps were necessary. un. real. so the delorean is on the right hand side and the left is populated with 80s lunchboxes, mogwais, free bumper stickers, general hilarity. we grabbed a cuppa and head over to the couch. we sank into the couch, grabbed an original nes controller and busted out with some of my fave game - bubble bobble! meanwhile, my friend nestled a stuffed et between us which immediately made for photo opps galore. we were surrounded by various iconic movie posters -- princess bride, goonies, star wars (natch) and enjoyed a rousing game while people worked away on their lappies.you must stop in here. it's rad, nifty, gnarly, groovy, fab, tubular. whatever 80s accolade you'd like to bust out. it's a portal back in time to a place where things were simple and riding your bike or the neighborhood grill was the next major event in life. i want to go in here and read the babysitters club, nancy drew, ramona quimby & goosebumps. today, when you're choosing your own adventure, choose this one.you like your bed? sure you do, silly - it's your bed. what about the room your bed is in (experts call it a 'bedroom')? you love that too! yes, love rules!guess what, punkies brewster? wormhole gets a million stars because it is my freakin bedroom, circa 1986.it's all there: a free-play nintendo with the same 18 games everyone had, lunchboxes that reflect a saturday morning cartoon lineup, a fucking mogwai just hanging out and not getting wet, a double fucking full-size delorean forever parked at 88mp.unfazed by what must be a common response, the baristas responded genuinely to my giddy adoration with facial expressions and banter that metaphysically high-fived throwback damien s. i don't squee, per se, but let's just say a major sigh of enthusiasm dropped when i was told the honey badger "thanks for scraps, stupid" bumper stickers were free. sup stocking stuffers.finally, as if getting bulldozed by the best kind of nostalgia isn't enough, their dollar macarons and radically refreshing rocket sauce (iced yerba mate, handmade ginger syrup and fresh lime) give edible cred to arguably the single greatest place in chicago.need further proof? the customer loyalty cards (buy 10, get one free) look like nes controllers and the drink countdown is in the contra/konami code. gahdayum genius.came here excited after reading some reviews. left disappointed. don't waste your time here! i was less than impressed with the staff, the coffee, and the overall atmosphere. staff & coffee: i'm a coffee and tea lover who loves exploring and discovering awesome new coffeehouses, i asked for some café basics (i.e. london fog, café miele) and was met with, "uhh, i don't know what that is.."  "...um... i don't think we have the stuff to make those.." and "yeah, umm all our drinks are on the menu" so, bummed over their lack of barista basics, i went with a basic drip pour--and was not a fan of the quality or brew.  hear me out when i say - the barista's here don't know coffee.  unless you want one of their kitschy, sugary signature drinks, don't bother getting anything to drink here. atmosphere:  the atmosphere here is...eclectic... but not an eclectic i could jive with. they had an interesting choice of music - too boisterous for me i couldn't study or have any kind of real conversations because i felt distracted by the blasting loud rap/pop music. also--while i would never consider myself a neat-freak, it's a dirty, grimy place. the dim lighting hides some of that though. overall, if you you're looking for a chill place with good coffee in chicago--don't waste your time here. there are so many wonderful places to get coffee in this city. i'd be happy to recommend a variety of other great spots!needed to find a coffee shop in wicker park to kill time and stay out of the rain before heading to mojo. this definitely served that purpose. it's a fun, funky place with an 80's throwback theme. i got the peanut butter koopa troopa latte which was yummy! finding a place to sit was tough because everyone parks for hours on their laptops or books, etc but a seat opened up when we needed it to. i definitely recommend popping in here if you want a good cup of coffee with a fun spin to it.ok, this is difficult for me. on the one hand, i really like the wormhole. the coffee is good, they have creative drinks, and a really cool-looking space. but there are some small drawbacks too: first, you're paying a serious premium for location, the delorean hanging on the wall, and the high-end coffee. this stuff ain't the cheapest caffeine in town, but most of that you can chalk up to "you get what you pay for." second, it's not a great place to hang out and work. a little too loud. a little too crowded. but if you're just looking for a drink and a place to talk with someone, wormhole is the place.third, i recently had my first (mildly) unpleasant experience there...i bike down milwaukee on my way to work every morning, and finally decided to stop in to take advantage of wormhole's yelp! announcement: "cyclists!  we wanna hang on your commute.  with you!  bring your helmet in & any amount of drip coffee you desire is on us.  before 9:00am!"  i had them fill up my thermos and bought a home-made pop-tart to assuage any lingering guilt for the free coffee. but they charged me $1.00 for the coffee. when i asked about it, they said that they only give out smalls as part of the commuter deal, and, because my thermos was bigger, they charged me. listen, this isn't a huge deal, it's still a discount, but don't say "any amount of drip coffee you desire is on us" if it isn't.i will say that the staff has been pleasant during my prior visits, so i'm trying not to let this (minor) annoyance color my overall perception of the place. i will probably stop back in with out-of-town guests so they can gawk at the kitschy (in a good way) decor, but from now on i'm not gonna bother getting off my bike on my way to work.***updated***: 1. thanks for your response, travis. i appreciate it. it's such a kind response, in fact, that i'm not entirely sure whether it's heartfelt or sarcastic (totally joking). i know that my 34-ounce thermos (which is an amazing product, btw: ) is massive, and when i do stop in again on my way to work i will bring a different, more reasonably sized vessel.  2. i changed the review to reflect the $1 charge (originally said $1.50) and also upped the rating because of your message.  like i sad above, i really do like wormhole, and your quick reply only helped that. thanks.the staff, managers, and travis are very pleasant and truly great at what they do.wormhole is one of just a few coffee shops in chicago that's committed to getting the best coffee possible out of those beans. you'll see the baristas literally writing lab protocols for water temp, brew time, weight of grounds, etc. for new beans they bring into the shop (which i think is weekly). it may be a little extravagant, but if want a great espresso drink, you want them to pull it for you. if you want a 900 calorie sweet roll, travis is your go-to guy.i do want to comment on this anti-hipsterism and yuppie thing. i know i'm probably not as sensitive about fitting in as some commenters may be. i can certainly understand feeling intimidated around people who look differently. 20 years after being a "hipster," i'm probably a "yuppie." these are both terrible things to be. i hated wearing dirty worn-out clothes and being covered in ugly tattoos, but it was fun to sneer at those effete wine-drinking yuppie snobs when they had to gall to sit in my coffee shop. now i hate having to shop at barney's and use a macbook. you cannot believe how uncomfortable this range rover's seats are. i guess it's nice to have grown up and be entitled to sneer at the hipster kiddies who don't appreciate a good coffee drink as much as i do, even though we're both in the same coffee shop.etc.this is the place i bring my laptop to when i am in chicago. the tables are big and comfortable, the coffee is good, the atmosphere is pleasant. first time it took me a while to find the wifi code, they are on little signs on the table. there is also a nintendo system in the back if you want a break :d the drip coffee is not always great, but the honey latte and vanilla bean latte have always come out perfect.wild interior...takes a couple back to memory lane with the delorian, et, goonies, etc. very cool.  we got liked the halfwit coffee.  really tasty and strong.  but, the customer service needs improvement... snotty staff.  glad we tried it, but won't be back.  i'm not paying for rude service.major points on its presentation. it is very eclectic and the ambiance and attendants mirror these themes. i love the art work on the inside, and the tea is strong and good.there seems to be a divide in the kind of seating that it provides; it has couches for groups of people to sit together and play video games, but then it has bigger community style tables for people to bring their computers and do their work. there are not really any smaller types of seating for smaller groups to talk and chat. that lost a star for me. great location, great vibe!this place is fun and puts a smile on my face.the staff is super friendly and helpful when ordering drinks.drinks are tasty and made right in front of you.complimentary water is available through a self serve spout.a delorean is part of the decoration if that gives you any hint of the coolness of this place.they serve muffins and other baked treats. yum.there is also outdoor seating which goes fast so take it if you see it.bike parking on street.croissant here is surprisingly good. we came by to grab a snack and kill some time before dinner. when you walk into a coffee shop, you should never expect anything but the coffee/drinks to be good, especially not the baked goods in the case, which could've been hanging out in there for god knows how long. however, this plain croissant my friend got at 7pm was perfectly crunchy on the outside and buttery. delicious.i can't vouch for the coffee here, as i'm the weirdo who doesn't drink coffee -- but i have it from my coffee-loving, former barista friend that it's super here. vibe is geeky-hipster as opposed to bookish-hipster. i think i might've seen something from star wars hanging on the walls and there were some college kids gaming right behind us (locals must dig this place). comfy couches and plenty of tables/chairs for people to work.i've found my home-- wormhole coffee.well, i love their coffee, its dark and warm, just like the dirt (but much, much more tasty).  i love squirming about in these comfortable chairs and couches.  the lighting is light, ambient, and appropriate.  i hate when it's super bright.  and the other people here are hipstery and sexy, i want to symbiotically mate with them.oh god, i just realized i'm a worm. awesome.i think this place is so interesting! great staff, they are polite and actually talk to you!the decor is a great great great way to go.  place is spacious, could use a couple more tables tho. anyways, i like this place, have been here a couple of times for coffee and pastries. yum!they had me at video games and coffee.what i wasn't prepared for was the nostalgic throwback decor and deliciously complex drinks. walking in from the street, i was sure this place was going to be more novelty than anything, but i was pleasantly surprised to find they really delivered on the yelp reviews.my friend got the peanut butter something or other that everyone was raving about, and he was in heaven. he's obsessed with peanut butter, so it was a perfect way to start out the day. i'm a little more of a purist, so i went with your standard black coffee, and i can gladly report that it was strong, but not too bitter or burnt. solid. on top of the drinks, they decorate with old school video game and cult movie paraphernalia, so if you're an 80s or 90s kid, you'll be right at home!this had to be one of the best places i visited on my trip to chicago. i enjoyed all of the stickers the coffee i got the small honey bear just so i could say i have had a coffee with a design in it once in my life. i enjoyed the delorian and the game area was adorable we had such a great time.love wormhole! this is my go-to place for a relaxing day to work on my laptop and enjoy a hot tea. super friendly service in here. very funky decor and atmosphere. also having vegan pastries from fritz doesn't hurt either! vegan twinkies! yum!!very very cool place. the honey bear latte was awesome and the trail mix scone was divine! wish i could make this place my regular coffee shop!felt like i was in a time warp, and enjoyed every minute of it! they didn't have cocoa puffs so i had chocolate cheerios with a shot of espresso and a vanilla latte. boy they mean business! i'm totally wired for the rest of the day! decor and music is right on point too! will definitely be back when i'm in the chicago area.i go out of my way (quite literally) every time i visit chicago ever since i discovered this cult shop in the wicker park district... i'm a coffee snob (@coffeecontigo via instagram) and this place gets it right every time.... not to mention the awesome swag they have for shopaholics like myself!!!best coffee i had drink in chicago.for those who are born in the 80s this coffee is the most endearing places to stop when walkig by milwaukee ave.love the geek deco, best hipster style.plus: good wifi conection and cool videogames to play.this place is so sick. all the movie references are pretty cool. coffee was unreal. staff is uber friendly. i got the peanut butter chocolate latte and the sarsaparilla chai and they were very tasty. can't wait to go back.***3.5 stars***super friendly staff that makes a fast drink.  hipster heavy coffee shop with a cool concept.  they really committed to the 80s and 90s vibe.  the amount of memorabilia they have strewn about the place is amazing.  floppy discs, alf lunch boxes, 80s movies posters, a dolorean????  you can even play old school nintendo games (punch out!!!!) while you sip your brew.  i've never seen anything like it.  with all the comfy couches and chairs, it seems like a place where you could hang out drinking coffee on your computer all day.  as for the drinks, we tried the plain espresso and cappuccino.  we both agreed the espresso itself was a little too sweet.  as for the cappuccino though, it was nicely made.very welcoming atmosphere. i am not much of a coffee drinker but the this coffee shop is great. they have a great display of vintage lunch boxes. in the back they have some couches next to a tv with a nintendo. i didn't use it but did want to .  also provide free wifi to customers.probably the coolest coffee shop i've ever been to! it's such a blast from the past walking in here. ok first of all there's a freakin delorean in the back in all its back to the furture glory. there's a huge gremlin portrait on the wall and really just a bunch of awesome 80s nostalgia all over this place. the space itself is also quite decent, large enough where you're not overhearing your neighbors conversations but maintains that cozy vibe like going home to your childhood basement to hang with your haven't heard too much of this halfwit coffee but it seems like a solid cup of joe based on the other reviews. i myself got a decaf vanilla bean latte and the hubs got a cold brew so can't tell you very much in regards to the actual coffee quality but both were tasty to us!definitely a must visit if you're in the area!great vibe, great spot to hang or study. throwback 80s gamer decor is pretty charming, and it's hard not to be impressed by the full-sized back to the future delorean. coffee is definitely solid but if you're in the neighborhood la colombe probably wins...before i walked in to this place, i had absolutely no desire to go there...at all.  it didn't look appealing to me (even with the patio)...i just didn't want to go.however, with few options in the area (and chilly weather), while waiting to eat at a nearby restaurant, i ventured in and was surprised.  first of all, the inside is much cuter than the curb appeal would make you believe.  it's welcoming and has a good selection of seating (if you can get it).  the coffee was delicious (albeit a bit slowly made...though the foam was perfectly positioned into a nice design for me...i'm a total sucker for good looking food/drinks!).  price-wise, it was reasonable.  so, all in all, a good visit.  i may be back!not much to say about ambiance that hasn't been said, but two important factors make wormhole above-and-beyond great:1. 8 oz lattes! so hard to find anywhere in chicago, where most people order more on the humongous side. i love a slightly more harmonious milk-to-espresso ratio, and they've got it down to a science.2. the cool but rude (curry-ginger syrup latte) is like me: cool, but rude, but also with a little kick, and also delicious.good coffee. really convenient that they're open late, however not a great place to study. usually always packed and the music is loud and not befitting of a place to do work.this coffee shop has a delorean inside of it. i know that's the most talked about thing and yet it's the least important thing when wanting a cup of coffee, but still. think about it.  this coffee shop has a fucking delorean inside of it!  pretty cool.  moving on...giancarla and i met up with kiera (of schuba's bartending fame) and i ordered a chai tea latte with vanilla.  awesome.  they make their own vanilla at wormhole so you should definitely try a vanilla latte, as giancarla did, and loved.  they boast some of the best baristas in chicago and all bragging rights are reserved.  don't expect to grab a quick cup and be out the door, because these folks take their time making you a drink with deliberation you can taste.  kiera opted for the vanilla-less americano and still felt it superior to most.  we all split a scone and enjoyed that as well, but it's a scone; no biggie.sondre joined us later with mona, kyrre, and åse (of norway's film, real estate, and rhetoric fame, respectively).  sondre got the "rocket juice"  comprised of iced yerba mate with ginger syrup and lime.  "refreshing and a delight."  kyrre and åse joined him on that order while kyrre added  " [he] liked it very much as well, but had to add lots of sugar to sweeten things up."  he gave it  a 6.5 while contributing the highest score to the company. *ahem*  agreed.  åse believed it to be an 8.  she also adds, "it was fresh, cooling, and energizing."mona went with a soy latte and was pleased by the heavy steaming.  in her words, "excellent, not too bitter, the soy milk was steamed into a perfectly creamy texture that is rarely found in an iced latte."  i can tell you, she's just as picky with her lattes as she is with her men, so this is a high compliment.the wormhole has a spacious interior, but on summer days it's nice to sit outside on the sidewalk.  definitely a great place; one worth re-visiting!!~dave "herremannen" heilmanthis place is really cute! i met a teacher here for a meeting and i'm glad she brought me here. it's a quaint place that's well decorated and cozy for those that need to do some serious studying. i hadn't realized it but they have a nice little patio section that wasn't packed at all. i went about mid-day so parking wasn't that bad and there was a lot of seating in the area. i can imagine that it gets packed in the afternoon. i didn't grab a coffee just yet but will next time! this would be an ideal place for sometime to take a quick study break or study their entire day away in!great place to relax, hangout, and kill some time over a cup of coffee. they have games, couches, and a casual ambience for social gatherings!great place with great atmosphere. lots of memorabilia and fun stuff around. couches, mood lighting and good service abound. coffee wasn't the cheapest in the world but this is chicago so what can you expect! nice place though. fast wifi.super fun concept, friendly staff, free wifi, and interesting drinks. how can things get better?! i got a peanut butter latte. amazingness. if i was local, i'd be here all the time.nerd? coffee snob? this is the spot for you. a bunch of things to admire and poke at (yeah, there's a delorean). i also liked the nintendo console they had set up. :deveryone seemed to be busy and kept to themselves. i don't strike up conversations so i wasn't looking for a whole lot, but it doesn't seem like a place to hang out with friends since everyone's so busy "working."great nerd/hipster coffee shop! it made me want to live in chicago! i was in town from l.a. and with my chi-friend and i looked on yelp! and saw this place got amazing reviews and i was not wrong in listening. we walked in and to the right was.... a delorean!!!! i freaked. that and there were great star wars mugs along the wall. ok--- so i walked up to order my regular-- grande skinny vanilla latte w/an extra shot of espresso.  the cashier was kind of thrown off and didn't have the best personable skills but she was nerdy and fun so i was good. :) overall a good experience with semi-cute nerds.  we got to play mario on the couch and enjoy a cheap drink. what more could you ask for?*i'm not a coffee drinker*.  but i go here.  it has a cool vibe and this is a great place to use my laptop outside of the house.  i'll buy *something*, as i'm not a jerk that's going to occupy space and use their power/wifi without being a customer.i'm really divided whether they're trying too hard to be hipster... and trying to hard to appeal to the nostalgia associated with the formative years of myself and the people who share my age demographic.... or if they're nailing it.young, hip, urban and centered around good coffee. a friend and i went to wormhole this morning and i think i have a new infusion of hipster in me. not only is the wicker park area a really cool part of chicago but the coffee there is really good as well. my friend, who is one great barista and coffee roaster, considers it to be the best espresso in the city. that says a lot to me. i had a pour over and it was very good... not as good as intelligentsia or madcap in grand rapids, mi but pretty good. the atmosphere is cluttered with stuff that people grew up on. they even have a tv where you can play the old super nintendo video games. woah! i'm sure if i'm back in the area, i will try to drop by. the really nice part is that there is free parking in the surrounding neighborhood which makes it easier to get to.the atmosphere is great, lots of cute decorations. i had a ginger tea because i went at night and wanted to sleep that night (so no coffee). i wish the tea was stronger. this place is definitely a cozy place to do work in.i pretty much never write reviews, but sometimes, i just have to. wormhole has really tasty coffee, and fun decor (castle greyscull!) they also have great people, and that is what counts in the end. i only wish i didn't start work so early so i could frequent them more often.if you understand the jokes on family guy, you'll love this place because it's an 80s paradise, that also serves great coffee and treats.the obvious focal point here in the delorean, but this place has everything you remember from your childhood including lunch boxes and thermoses, console video games and even 5 1/4 floppy drives.  everything here is a tribute to that awkward decade.  ok it was awkward for me because i was a teenager.the drinks all have names reminiscent of 80s kitsch but like others say the peanut butter koopa troopa is the bomb!  if it were just atmosphere it would be great but the inclusion of great coffee drinks and methods (pour over, chemex) makes it totally tubular.  service was great and despite a long line, drinks came out quicki pulled out my laptop and worked for hours.  it's really comfy here with large chairs, benches and tables.  stay a while and enjoy yourself. my only complain:  no jolt cola.  that would be awesome if they could reproduce that because that really helped me get through the 80s.  it gives you 88 gigawatts of caffeine powerstep back to a time when any problem could be solved in 30 minutes by an all-knowing dad.love this little coffee shop has your grandmother old sofas and its just a fun little place to relax and have good coffee. if you are a peanut butter fan the koopa troopa is to die for. have funobsessed with the '80s?  even if you're not, it's nice to revisit once in a while. if you agree, wormhole fills the bill.  enjoy the time warp.i was reminded of intelligensia or next door next to milennium park when i saw the bar counter. i really like the concept of a coffee bar. it makes things more interesting and it provides more room for the customers to sit at than just plain circular tables. wow, they had an nintendo original! i immediately recognized the super mario game i used to play when i was a kid on the screen and the plastic gun for the duck shooting game :) nostalgia i think my favorite part was the bathroom. it was a calvin hobbes themed bathroom. how freakin cool is that? i really appreciated wormhole for it. normally, the conception of a public bathroom  is that it shouldn't be decorated and that it should only serve the purpose of a lavatory like a bathroom at target or ohare. but that's where people get it wrong i think. the smallest things do matter.wandered in here on a mission for great coffee and left satisfied. i ordered a peanut butter latte (i believe it was actually called the peanut butta paratroopa or something similar) and a pastry. i didn't stay long but it felt like comfy place. besides, you can't go wrong with a place that has a back to the future time machine.the coffee is delicious and watching kids play super mario bros 3 on a couch transported me back to my childhood.what didn't make my day was having an employee ask me with a bit of attitude, "did you even try it?" as i was putting a little sugar into my coffee.as a matter of fact i did try it, and since i paid for my own coffee, why don't you just shut your mouth and let me enjoy my coffee?! i love visiting chicago, but won't be coming back here.cool spot with a lot of seating and  really low-key. seating inside and out. coffee was less great than the place though.  i want to try more, and the flavor in my latte was nice, but it tasted watered down. i usually don't use sugar, but this latte got better with some sugar, i guess because it gave it a little more taste. i'd try it again, but with so many coffee shops around i don't crave it.are you required to have a mac here? i'm not kidding, every time i am here, its like ~85% mac laptops. the even weirder thing is that if you go to filter (just down the street, 5 minute walk), the ratio is reversed, probably 85% pc.what does this mean about wormhole? probably nothing, just an interesting observation.anyway, the coffee is good, the place is kitchy, its better than starbucks (not saying much there), and its super close to my place, so all in all, yes, i am there very often.this place has yet to let me down. i love consistency. the honey bear latte is amazing. the counter staff is always very attentive and pleasant. this is the kind of place i'll go out of my way for if i really need some good coffee. my only issue (that isn't even a real issue) i've ever had is i've never been able to get seating to hang out there. not once. that's not an awful problem, good for them! they're making money. i can take my stuff to go. but one day i'd love to just sit and hang and read a book, it looks so cozy in there! the decor is kitschy and adorable. super inviting.randomly came here because it's four blocks from bar method class and i was an hour early. walked over and man and i glad i did. it felt like being in someones over sized comfy living room who loves video games from the 80s! did i mention that they have a nintendo with lots of games... and... and... annnnnnnnddddd.... the duck hunt gun!!! i didn't know what to do with myself. i sat there and played as long as i could along with a 12 oz peanut butter koopa troopa which i highly recommend. this place is so comfy and awesome, i can't wait to go back!!!!once i walk into wormhole cafe all i can think of when i see that awesome delorean parked in the front window is huey lewis...   don't bet your future, on one roll of the dice better remember, lightning never strikes twice please don't drive at eight, don't wanna be late again so take me away, i don't mind but you better promise me, i'll be back in time gotta get back in time gotta get back in time get me back in tiiiimeee!!!!    i love the loose leaf tea..definitely reccomend ordering the white tea. when i'm in the coffee mood the mochas are pretty tasty as well & i love the artwork the baristas do with the foam too. =) cool points for offering a punch card...buy 10 dranks get one free!!! the vegan blueberry muffins are pretty good too for breakast..will have to try the cereal next time i roll through!  cereal & milk..cereal & milk..cereal & milk & coffee!!!! wormhole is a cool place to chill...free wifi..old school nintendo games, board games & lotsa 80s nostalgia. in my book wormhole cafe is one of the best arooound nothin's ever gonna keep me down!!!!! wormhole's got this in the bag...yeaaaa johnny put him in a body bag!!!!everything about this place is mind blowing. the friendly atmosphere, 80's memorabilia, posters, comfy sofas and chairs, and of course, the coffee. ah, the coffee and lattes here are out of this world. perfect place to chat, catch up, gather your thoughts or study (which is what i should be doing). enjoy!kitschy (though not with such a negative connotation) with barrels full of 80s action heroes and plate glass so you can use them as tables; chill, kind of hipster vibe with good chai and a great variety of beverages, some of which they invent and change regularly. love the beverage names and definitely a place to become a regular, but apparently there are a lot of people of this opinion because getting a seat is tough!i went to the wormhole based on a zagat article posting about fun coffee drinks in chicago.  i am always up for a delicious espresso or tea latte, so i checked it out.  this place definitely has a lot of character - with 80's style lunch boxes lining the top of the bar and a full size car mounted over the restrooms.  the place was completely packed when we went and had to ask someone to move over a seat so we could sit together.i got the honey bear latte based on the zagat review.  the espresso was smooth, but the drink was not that unique.  it also was not as hot as i would have liked.  overall, this place has a lot of character and is a great place to relax, do work, catch up w/ friends.. - just don't go expecting unique drinks.get the honey bear latte iced. it's my new summer favorite!146/365great scenery for an 80s baby like me. varied selection, wifi, seating , couches all you expect in a coffee shop. parking is street. good for a quick convo or studying though i did wish they stayed open longer . imagine if this was 24 hr man wouldn't leave this place for studyingonly went here once, but was very impressed. i got the honey bear and it was delightful. the place was also very cute and eclectic - kind of an 80's culture/gaming vibe. saw a few people working on their laptops, there's large tables to get work done.yelp removed my original review, said it was inappropriate. so, i'll be pc for this one:i asked for a soy macchiato. not a cappuccino. very nicely, i asked the barista to make my macchiato with more foam, i like foam...instead of saying, "sure!" she said, "okay...just so you know, next time order a cappuccino, just for future reference." now, she didn't know it but i've worked off and on in the coffee industry for seven years. so, naturally i responded, "oh...okay. a macchiato is two shots of espresso and foam though, right?" "it is but we do a free pour here so. just order a cappuccino next time."i couldn't handle that. a sufficient, "sure i can do that" would have been great. so, me being me, i proceeded with, "i guess seven years of coffee experience means nothing..." her response? "no, maybe not. starbucks?" "no."so, my point here is when i ask for a macchiato, i think i know what i want, and i don't think it's the job of the barista to tell me otherwise unless i'm actually wrong. what i should have told her in regards to her suggestion that i get a cappuccino, "i don't want a cappuccino, and i don't want a cortado". after all, if you're free pouring steamed/frothed milk, without discarding the actual liquid, you're making a cortado, and a macchiato is two shots with a dollop of foam.--update--the owner of this business and the barista i complained about responded to my review. i really appreciate that effort, as it shows that the owner cares. it was still a disappointing experience, but i do think their responding made up for it a little bit. if either of you is reading this, thank you for saying sorry.i should start off by saying i work in coffee and have for a couple of years. let me describe my experience. friendly girl takes one order before mine, then mine (two pour overs) and then i sit down. and wait. and wait. and wait. the guy in front of me gets his peanut butter something latte. and i wait. and then the person behind me gets their latte. and then they decide to call their coworker off of a couch in the back to start my drinks. at this point it has been about five minutes. i say about because i only decided to start a timer about three minutes in. this gentleman takes his sweet time getting everything set up. he then proceeds to make one of the two coffees. in the middle of making the first i watched him blow his nose and not wash his hands. then he starts on the second. so the average v60 taking 3-4 minutes means on top of the initial wait i have to wait 8 minutes for my two coffees. it took so long that one of the other patrons expressed concern for my dog who was patiently waiting outside for me. i used to go to wormhole while i was in law school before their facelift. i have only been a few times since then and every experience has been the same...last time it took ~7 minutes for my friends americano. there was one other person in the shop. he let the shot die in its cup for over a minute and then finally poured hot water on top. this is just unacceptable from a third wave coffee shop. and seriously, wash your hands if you are going to blow your nose. that is just disgusting.best coffee shop i've visited in chicago, hands down. best aesthetic, great (and cheap) coffee, and nice baristas. yes, they're quirky, but it's never obnoxious and there's always a good mix of unpretentious folks hanging out and solid music playing.we have long been regulars here, and with good reason.  i'd be willing to call them a top 3 coffee place for me.the place takes you back to the 80's ... literally, as they actually have a delorean in the place.  all the 80's decorations really make the place, but you're there for the coffee, right?we've never been disappointed here.  the honey bear is probably the best, though the bill cosby for a long time was great as well.  every employee is super friendly, so don't hesitate to get a recommendation.92/365love this place the baristas were so great, and super friendly.   went here with my family and we all enjoyed it.  definitely recommend this spot for a great cup of coffee and some cool things to look at.  even got a hug from the barista as we left.walking into wormhole, we were concerned about finding vegan pastries for breakfast.  we had no reason to worry, because more than half of their offerings are vegan.  loved the blueberry pop tart, raspberry corn meal muffin and their coffee.  the honey bear lattes are to die for.80's memorabilia throughout takes us back to our childhood.  had fun sitting at the back couch, playing super mario bros. on an old nintendo.when it comes to coffee i'm hard to impress. i want my baristas to know what they are doing. however, i also don't want to hang out with staff and customers that act like snobs. i think wormhole is the best place in chicago to get what i want. the drinks are brewed to perfection. snacks are a good grab, especially sweets. they also mix it up with tons of fun and interesting creations. they bring you some of the very best coffee without acting like elitists.i almost didn't enjoy wormhole because it is in the hipster part of chicago. i mean empty bottles of pabst blue ribbon scatter the streets. and it's working very hard on it's 80's thing. but i have to admit it;s a great place to hang out and i loved it's cheesy 80's style even if the hipsters also love it.the truth is the food, drinks, staff and decor are fun. i always feel comfortable. i find it one of the best places to study. music is kept at a good level (always 80's) and you can bunker down into a variety of seating arrangements.the chocolate croissant is perfect- flakey on the outside, doughy on the inside. the mochas are good too, they aren't as sweet as some mochas but aren't bitter either... they are right in the middle.  if you are planning on reading or needing light, the front of the coffee shop by the windows has more light.  the back is a little dark.  good music and nice atmosphere.quiet yet bustling atmosphereunearthly honey bear latte plenty of seats and outlets with a great wifi connectionshipster baristas and one of the few cafés in the city where it's actually warm during the winternothing to not love abt this place. two negatives, is that allowed?the coffee was slightly above average.  but the atmosphere and environment were off the chart.  with skinny jeans coming back this 80s throwback theme took me back to the future where i remember playing super mario for days and hours upon hours knowing all the tricks.  loved it, couldve hung out there all day, and of course i ordered multiple drinks bc the atmosphere made it all come together, the quality of coffee didnt matter at that point as i was living the experience!!!what is even better than going to brunch on saturday? going to the wormhole and sipping on a cappuccino while eating a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch! this place takes you back to saturday mornings as a kid. it's fun, coffee is good, and cereal selection is the bomb.i have to go down the wormhole at least once every time i visit chicago to try the creative seasonal special. i've tried the bill cosby banana pudding latte which was great and the harrison gourd espresso which was interesting but way too small. to be honest the drinks are extremely overpriced, 5 dollars gets you a 12 ounce beverage compared to a 24 ounce venti at starbucks. also my wife always complains her drinks are too strong or burnt tasting, even the peanut butter mocha which i thought she would love. but you also get top quality ingredients, strong flavorful coffee, cool atmosphere, toys and foam art! make sure you take a peak before you put on the to-go lid. i also love that if your drink is to stay it is served in a real mug instead of a paper cup.you go to wicker park to be among the hipsters, if not just stick to another neighborhood. we were strolling the neighborhood and stopped by for chai and iced coffee. the drinks were pretty good. the seating and decor were lots of fun. they have video game and pop culture posters, an old-school tv with a super nintendo for you to play and a full delorean to oogle at!drinks: 4/5service: 4/5location: 5/5i love to come here either to read, study, or chat with friends. i love their chai latte and jasmine tea. it's a really cozy place. the only thing is it can get very crowded and can be hard to find a space after 9pm because this place closes later than other coffeeshop. staffs here really nice.awesome coffee awesome vibes. great while waiting for your table at one of the neighboring breakfast joints.great place to get back in the 80s and enjoy your coffee experience there. a little bit loud music, but plenty of space to work on your laptop.discovered halfwit coffee here - nutty and wonderful. whatever glorious muffin i chose was delightful (pretty sure most items are vegan) - corn bread-ish with raspberries and a little bit o love. i appreciate a place that makes the soy milk immediately available.. good place to get some work done - the other patrons are right there with you and the baristas are the friendliest hipsters in town. good tunes selection that is just loud enough you can still chat about the delorean hangin outgreat chai tea latte. love the laid back vibe here. great place to work from with pretty high speed wifi. 'nuff said. wonderful place for an extroverted introvert.the place overall has a very neat vibe. it reminds me more of a comic book store mixed with a peet's. i ordered a simple house coffee and i do not think i was prepared for the taste. it was reminiscent of coffee that has gone bad, very bitter and sour aftertaste. i am sure the other options are great, but i personally did not enjoy it. i am willing to give it another shot next time i am nearby.as yelp says for 4 star reviews - "yay!  i'm a fan"the space is legit.  it's a really chill environment located in a not so chill area, but you'll want to chill after looking for parking on milwaukee avenue.  the koopa troopa everyone raves about is worth raving about.  i ordered an extra shot because i thought it would be too sweet, but it definitely wasn't.  and the extra shot just added another dimension to the flavor. the drip coffee they were serving was from half wit.  i'm not a black coffee drinker - i need milk/cream/something in it.  until today.  i tried half wits peru blend, and it was amazing.  i drank it black, liked it so much i bought a bag of beans, and got another free coffee with it, which i proceeded to drink as well.-1 star because i didn't feel the baristas were very friendly.  i live near a lot of coffee places i frequent, and they are always pleasant, no matter what time of day i visit.i left wormhole in good spirits, buzzed from the caffeine, and ready to tackle the rest of my work day.yay!  i'm a fan!such a neat place. love the decor,  the atmosphere, and of course the coffee. coconut macaroons are mouth-watering good. def recommend!best chai latte i've ever had! perfect and beautifully topped! enjoyable space, even with the droves of people that stop in, and for good reason! can't wait to go back!love the atmosphere! they have a  good cup of coffee and it's a great place to hang while you're waiting for you table at the bongo room!thank you, wormhole coffee, for giving me free cocoa puffs just for getting coffee (and not thinking it was too weird when i asked for the coffee in the cocoa puffs), and for letting me have breakfast next to a delorean.  was i dreaming that? nope, the internet confirms: this place does exist, it's for real.  don't knock a good idea, especially if it involves the 80's. not in my house! to anyone who didn't get tip-toppity service: maybe you weren't cracking the right jokes? i had a blast just ordering, complete with instant inside jokes and high fives. i feel like if i lived in chicago and came here regularly, the staff and i would be ...how do you say? b.f.f.one of my favorite places to stop at in chicago! i don't know what else to say that no one has already said. i could spend a couple hours in there and not feel unwelcome. they have a nintendo system in the back with super old games. and a couple calvin and hobbes books that i remember reading under my pillow in elementary school. the place is usually crowded but i've studied here and had no issues finding an outlet. the cold brew is great. i also liked the honey latte and i'm not a huge fan of lattes, so it's worth a try. the last time we were here, we also tried an iced country grammar which is basically iced tea with espresso and lemon. i'm not sure if i'd get it again over a regular coffee but it was very unique & perfect for a hot day.this place made me happy.  it could have been the 80s lunch boxes, or the retro movie posters (coming to america!!!) or the delorean.  it was probably all of the above.  and of course, the coffee.  the place was packed, but i was happy to find a comfortable and cozy seat in the back where i could enjoy my honey latte and a chat with an old friend.  coffee was fantastic.  i'm no coffee aficionado (i get my morning brew from 7-11), but it got the thumb's up from my husband who gets coffee more than i do.  you may have to wait for your drink but its definitely worth it.  don't worry, there is plenty of throwback items to admire while waiting for your brew.  yep, i like it...the wormhole is has a permanent spot on my chicago short list of places to visit.i just had a horrible experience with a person working the counter.  i ordered the vegan doughnut and a tea to go.  i made a special trip for the vegan doughnut on my very short lunch break.  she dropped the doughnut hole on the counter and didn't bother to apologize and i quickly said  "oh, i don't mind!"meaning please put the hole in the bag with the rest of the doughnut and she did not even bother to ask me to clarify what i meant she simply picked up the doughnut hole and threw it in the garbage!  to my absolute horror.  the worst part was that she did not even apologize!  did i mention that?!  so rude ;-(.i am not going back.anna likes this place. cozy. don't worry no worms here! lol.... it's a fun spot! see for yourself!i think i just walked back to the future, and it's not because they have a delorean dmc 12 seating in the middle of the coffee shop. it's because of the awesome ghostbuster throw back posters and the gremlins stuffed animals over the counter top. (props). i can't believe that i used to live down the street from this gem of a coffee shop and never ventured inside. well sunday was my first day, and i can't believe that i snoozed on such a killer dope spot. the staff is the friendliest, nicest, most kick ass attitude you can find in the area. the lady behind the counter was cracking jokes and living life up. mad cool peeps.we started off with the tiger's blood and peanut butter koopa troopa (check the photo's).both drinks were mad tasty, and made with love.they also have tons of power outlets if you needed to get some work done. the community seating is pretty cool, but the best seat is the window corner banger. wormhole is mad bomb. go check it out, and grab a tasty pick me up'er. dope 80's action figures everywhere.if you lived in the 1980s, you'll find wormhole comfortable.  it has the feel of an art exhibition of that decade, complete with memorabilia from goonies, back to the future, nintendo, california raisins, and countless other old childhood favorites.coffee shops are effectively the offices of nightowl workers and the libraries of away-from-school students.  unfortunately there are only a handful of places open past 10:00.  this is unfortunate for anyone who gets home and finishes dinner late.  wormhole is open till midnight, which is a simple but incredibly useful feature. also, there are large desks and a stimulating yet non-distracting atmosphere to keep you on task with whatever work you bring in.some of their coffee drinks are gorgeous. all of their coffee beans are delicious.i highly recommend their vanilla bean latte.the best thing about this place is the atmosphere, though. i mean, they have a freaking delorean in the window. the whole place is like a blast from my childhood.the baristas are extremely nice, approachable, and sometimes hilarious. i just wish parking was a bit better around here, but i doubt most of their clientele (i'm assuming bikers) mind.if only these little coffee places along milwaukee were open late...maybe one day i'll go to a coffee shop for coffee. maybe the bulls will have a winning season (since it's possible i might actually go to a coffee shop for coffee, i needed to pick a team i wouldn't hate to see win). but, disregarding the world of maybes for the reality of... reality, it's important to note that even if you're not chugging down java, wormhole is still a rad place to spend some time.first off, if you're 28-40, enjoyed any part of the 1980s, remember when lunchboxes were metal weapons and movie posters were integral part of marketing campaigns, you will love this space. i promise. there's a freaking delorean in the window. you will fight with children for the opportunity to get inside. you will cheat to win. you will not care. to come up with a decor this awesome, you might assume the staff is totally awesome (see, '80s). you assume correctly. from baristas to owners, the folks at wormhole will treat you right and you'll be happy for the experience.so, what does someone who admits to binky sabotage in order to prevail in a match of wits with a toddler enjoy at a coffeeshop of this sort? sprecher root beer and ginormous chocolate chocolate chip muffins. i don't know where one began and the other ended. all i know is that i ate/drank inside wormhole, on the street, at the park, in my car... and, suddenly, i was at home, with a face covered in crumbs and a belly burping caramel carbonation. and, i was happy.i mean, there are random ets, cookie monsters and atari systems just laying about this place. there might even be a yelp lunchbox in the mix. win.i drink coffee all over chicago and these guys are using the most flavorful beans and best brewing of all. the inside decor is funky too. have you seen a delorean car up close? no, you are not over-caffeinated. it's the real thing.lots of seating--bar and couch and chair options.friendly employees who don't talk down to you.reasonable prices.delicious beverages.total win.suuuper strong decaf!!!aaaaah : dthe interior was awesome. the customers were paul from the wonder years. i see why it was called wormhole. people inside reminded me worms in a hole. richard scary's lowly worm model to be exact. i liked the floppy disks, decor and coffee.cool ambiance.  makes you feel like a kid, even if its not your generation of toys.i've never had better coffee.  i so want to create a new position in our office and bring this home.out-of-towner here, so i have been here once.excellent coffee. i got the homemade vanilla bean. superb, with great aroma and a pretty little milk flower on top. the decor is also quite lovely, with retro games and movie fixtures. sooooo tempted to buy their goonies inspired shirt! recommend going for sure.at the end of the first "back to the future" film, doc brown exclaimed to marty, "where we're going we don't need roads!" the future he referred to was 2015, where flying cars are the norm and everyone still looks like they're in the '80s.come 2014, i don't see this wonderful-sounding future without roads, but i do see wormhole, a beacon of hope in cloudy present-day chicago, dense with a starbucks and pretentious coffee roaster on every hip block. wormhole does not follow the road. it avoids it, flies over it with it's dorkifying 80s theme and the ability to make a great coffee beverage from the right beans and the oddest of ingredients.let's start with the vibe. there are 80s geek culture references all over the place. even if you aren't a geek you'll still appreciate it. from gremlins to nintendo, i loved every bit of it, but my 7 year old past self freaked out when i saw the 80s replica of the emperor's imperial shuttle from return of the jedi. so it gets pretty geeky.and my, is that a real delorean that has been fitted to look like the one from back to the future?!now to the coffee-- the place appears to be a flagship coffee shop for halfwit coffee, which is a local chicago roaster that doesn't take itself too seriously. despite this, the stuff is very bold, very tasty, and overall very awesome. i would suggest trying the drip coffee if you really want to savor the flavor of the coffee, otherwise, go straight to the specialty menu. the koopa troopa is my favorite-- made with real peanut butter, you may be think about the consistency or the risk of getting a cavity immediately. however, don't. the coffee and peanut butter somehow mix together perfectly. it's amazing.my second favorite was a past seasonal, the cosby classic, which tasted exactly like banana-pudding. just the way bill likes it. i think the new seasonal is a curry latte, which is as interesting as it sounds. none of these sugary or savory flavors overpower the coffee either-- everything is balanced out very well.seriously fly here as fast as you can. it's the future of coffee rooted in an 8-bit past.this is my favorite place in the wicker park neighborhood. i love to go there to play nintendo. the decor is total 80's kitsch. what can one say about how '80s a place is when there is a delorean time machine hanging on the wall? the aesthetics of the place are quite captivating. local people have contributed small things like handmade coasters and tapestries that make the place feel more homey. aside from the environment, the coffee served is wonderful, whether hot or cold. the honey bear latte and peanut butter koopa troopa are two incredible concoctions. the baked goods are delicious as well. this local shop is the wonderful anti-starbucks. i love coming here in my free time to enjoy a drink and a game.good coffee and atmosphere. music is loud-ish but good for being productive and if anything drowns out chatter. i especially like the whale paintings near the back. the espresso machine is some kind of strada and they seem to know how to use it. i think they get coffee from half wit and honestly i don't know much about them yet.it is not uncommon for me to come here 2+ times a day. sometimes i feel weird, like i'm a clingy ex girlfriend who keeps coming back. "oh, it's you again?". thankfully no one has pointed out the fact that i spend just as much time here as i do at home or school. i come here every morning that i have class. i basically survive on their coffee and cornbread berry muffins. i think it officially makes up 60% of my diet, all for +/- $5 a day.the only problem with this place is that it is frequently busy and it is hard to predict when there will be open space to sit down. i guess this isn't so much a problem as it is a testament to how great this place is. i often have to awkwardly hover until someone finally leaves. oh well. best coffee/espresso in the city. hands down. intelligentsia doesn't have shit on wormhole.great little coffee spot. then again, any spot lined with video game & star wars memorabilia, calvin & hobbes art, and a full size delorean is pretty awesome. hipsters feel right at home here. and the coffee works as advertised.well done, wormhole.i love, love, love this coffee shop. it feels like my '80s childhood, but the place is no gimmick. their coffee is for real! i have to stick to decaf if i'm there for too long. i go here way more than i should to get sh*t done. the caffeination coupled with inspiration from my youth makes me all warm, fuzzy and productive. i definitely recommend coming in on off-hours if you plan on sitting. the place can get crowded. as far as menu items, i recommend the peanut butter koopa troopa for first-timers.  their seasonal offerings are good, too. can't wait to try the cool but rude!there's a delorean in this coffee shop.  do i even need to say anything else?ok, i'll say something about the actual shop, too.  but there's a delorean in here!!!!!!!  ahhhh!!!the space is really nice, large and inviting.  on a thursday afternoon, the place wasn't full up but it was pretty packed.  my coworker and i found a place on the couch to work, which was fine.  there was still chair/couch space available.  there's a long bench table for laptop working, which was nice, but of course full.  i bet you could squeeze in early in the a.m. or late in the p.m.  they're open early and close late, which is a plus for anyone who wants to work and/or hang out.unfortunately, i didn't sample any coffee because i was hungry, so i made a mistake and got their food.  even though i give this place five stars (mostly for that delorean and it's potential), the food is awful.  i'm not sure where they purchase this stuff from or if they make it in house, but it's truly terrible.  my vegetarian sandwich was too giant hunks of bread with almost nothing in the middle.  the label boasted an array of veggies and hummus, but i could hardly detect any of this once i started eating.  i essentially just purchased two enormous, dry pieces of bread with a teaspoon of hummus in the middle for $5.  the bottled coke was ok, so i guess that made it a little better.  could you get some bottled diet coke, please?  don't get the food.  period.i'm not sure how the desserts are, but after my experience with the awful food, i may not even try to sample.  the coffee products are served in reusable mugs and cups (plus) and my coworker said the coffee was delicious, so wormhole definitely has potential.  the space is great and i can see myself coming here to work and hang out.  the decor is reminiscent of my room circa 1991 (80s movies posters and a pound puppy lunch box), which i of course appreciate.  i love the decor and i know i'll be back to work in the future.super popular for a reason: excellent coffee, nice staff, and wonderful atmosphere. on brunch mornings put your name in at bongo room then head here to grab some pre-brunch coffee and wait for your table to open up.ok, someone needs to hop into that delorean that's parked up front and build a wormhole coffee in toronto, stat. so much to adore about this unique and charming coffee shop:* cute baristas who may or may not have even been alive in the 80s* a big, communal table where students and freelancers co-work on their laptops in harmony* furniture that's a mix of modern and vintage but not those lame, kitschy disc chairs that were so popular in the early 80s. there are multiple sunken living rooms here and the vibe is super casual and welcoming.* artwork is full of movie posters from the best decade ever, including ghostbusters, weird science, goonies, gremlins and top gun* 80s cereal like cocoa puffs for snacking* i shit you not, a drink called a bobacino. named after boba fett.and they serve stumptown and metropolis coffee. what more can you ask for, but a location closer to you?we love this place!!!  it's so unique.  the coffee is the most quality i've ever tasted. plus there is the d'lorean from back to the future in it.  i think you will enjoy this place but warning it get crowded and you won't find a set but that fact remaining, you will have a unique time and you will appreciate the unusual atmosphere.only in chicago would you find a place like this!  i agree with the reviews that stated that they enjoyed this place and so will you.i love this place!i've been searching for years for that perfect coffee shop to sit down and write. i adore dollop (in buena park), but i never could get focused and writing there. wormhole gets my creative juices flowing, i guess they just have the perfect vibe for me. maybe it's all the '80's movies goods, i'm a big ol' geek. the staff is fantastic, always friendly. prices are average for a coffee shop. great coffee and teas. i recommend this place to friends constantly. :-)great drinks, great pastries, and a great environment. if i lived closer if be there everyday. for now i'll settle for a biweekly drive and it's totally worth it!wormhole is an awesome place to hang out for an afternoon of free wi-fi and some coffee.  i'm not a huge fan of their coffee--it's ok but i've yet to have something that really wowed me.  however, the vanilla specialty drink is quite yummy.  not for you coffee purists, but its a nice vanilla latte (~$5 for a 12 oz), a little sweeter than i would have preferred but not overly so, with the vanilla really coming through.  the ambiance and comfiness of the coffee shop are really its selling points.  wi-fi usage and spending hours parked on their couches or at the large tables is encouraged, with an abundance of outlets provided.  everybody i've met there has been incredibly friendly (the customers) and the staff are great as well.my only complaint is that the flat, dark walls make the coffee dark even at noon time--some newer white or off grey walls would be much appreciated to brighten up the place.  a few scattered lamps, some spotlights, and the dark furniture give it an aura of a cozy nook even on the brightest days though, so if that's what you're looking for, this is a great place to get some work done.p.s. i couldn't get my wi-fi to work the last time i was there (never had a problem before) but free people is right next door and well, we all know wi-fi signals can traverse walls...i hit ctrl + f and found the word "best" 9 times. let's make that 13. best (11) best (12) best (13)greatest coffee, service, quality of goods, environment, nostalgia if you were actually born before 1985, and incredibly friendly people. i have had a tendency of getting their just before they shut down the espresso machine when working midnights and they amount of guilt that was imposed was politely minimal at best. i kid! they are great. a must-stop if you are visiting and need a good latte while you use their wifi to figure out why milwaukee avenue and damen are so confusing.best. ah, 14 times.best. chai. ever.stopped in here after a loooong walk. we were looking for a cafe with character, a place that evoked the same vibe as our favorite college hangout, with weird art, friendly but eccentric baristas, and solid coffee drinks.wormhole didn't disappoint. yes, as other reviewers have noted, it is full of the wicker park hipsters (less intimidating than the williamsburg species, which i encounter frequently in my current brooklyn neighborhood). in fact, the hipster next to us was kind enough to interject his restaurant opinions, allowing me to stare into his piercing blue eyes* while he did so.but i digress. the chai tea i ordered was the single best chai i've ever had. and i've drunk chai in ~10 countries, on 3 continents. so....you should probably try it. most chai teas fall into either the sweet camp or spicy camp, disappointing those in the other camp. this one straddles the line between the two perfectly. the barista topped it off with a beautiful milky-foam flower, and this seattle girl appreciates coffee art.only complaint about wormhole: not enough seating.-*my boyfriend noticed the eyes, too. it wasn't just me.great coffee and very comfortable chill spot. with 90s decor that made it interesting and fun.i stopped in at the wormhole on a short trip to chicago - i was walking down milwaukee ave looking for some coffee and i didn't immediately notice this was even a coffee shop until i got close enough to see people sitting with big mugs of coffee in the window.am i ever glad i did!upon walking in, you're immediately greeted by a great decor of vintage sci-fi collectibles.  although the decor may sound out of place, it wasn't overdone or tacky, but just right and enhanced the atmosphere.  with a lot of customers sporting modern smartphones and laptops, emperor palpatine's shuttle and castle grayskull created a nice little juxtaposition.oh, did i forget about the coffee?  that's the best part.  i wish i had found this place on my first day, rather than my last in chicago. i really only got a chance to drink their coffee once, and boy was it a nice roast, properly extracted for my enjoyment, by a super nice barista!simply amazing coffee. great service. great space.the coffee is good.however, the waitstaff here consists of self-important hipster douchebags that look they haven't showered in two weeks and rude are enough to scoff at you if you don't hear them mumble your name when your order is ready. it's as if they are paying you to make their product. seriously, guys. you make good coffee, but it is going to be a while before i come back again. there are places with better baristas.peanut butter latte for the win. great space, it's cute and spacious yet intimate which can be tough to pull off. i obviously has the peanut butter latte but i'm sure you would not be disappointed by any of their coffee drinks. definitely a wicker park favorite.the coffee is ok, the atmosphere is definitely unique and interesting;it's worth a stop in.it is a special cafe, the decoration is interesting, but a little small and crowded, maybe because it is hot and popular~hohoi like peanut butter koopa~ it is very smooth.if it is not too crowded, i would like to stay there for a whole dash for reading.so i was ready to take a break after the first round of chicago reviews but had to log back in to make sure i address...what is only known as...the wormhole. or, "the hole," among locals, i'm guessing. i would certainly call it "the hole" if i lived around the area.this place...has amazing coffee...sells retro lunch boxes (i bought a peanuts one)...has star wars posters and ghostbusters posters...a nintendo or something in the back...and a butt load of people pretending to do work on their laptops. it is undeniably hip. it has a paper drawing of a scientific wormhole or some shit on the front door. that is freakin' hip. i live for coffee places like this. substitute live with yelp.i was visiting a friend in wicker park and we decided to have brunch at the bongo room. instead of sitting outside in the heat for our 30 minute wait we scooted over to  wormhole for a pre-brunch coffee, and i'm so glad we did. i loved the place immediately. all of the little pieces of decor kept bringing back old memories of being a child in the 80s - especially the perler bead art.instead of my usual americano i decided to go froofy and got some honey latte that had a fun name; i was intrigued by it because they used local honey in it, which makes me warm & fuzzy inside. it was really good, i enjoyed every sip of it. the only downer was the wait for our drinks. but that means two positive things to me: people like the place, and they don't rush making drinks.plus, not only do they have good coffee & service (most important) but i sat on a comfy couch getting my ass kicked at dr. mario while enjoying my drink; not a bad way to start a morning. i was very excited to go back the next morning, but circumstances kept me from my coffee. next time i'm in the wicker park area though,  you can bet your koopa ass i'll be stopping at wormhole.i was waiting on line for quite a while (about 5 minutes) with only 1 person in front of me. i was busy ready emails on my phone and finally looked up and realized the only reason i was waiting for so long is because the employee was friends with the person in front of me. there was no sense of urgency to end the conversation or to continue it while taking my order. i tried to interrupt and got an attitude, so i happily walked a couple blocks to starbucks. i guess talking about bicycles and who's mustache is cooler is more important than serving customers.overall, i like this place. the atmosphere/clientele is definitely the classic wicker park "hipster"/yupster scene. the decor is 80s and has some interesting artwork on the walls. it's extremely chill and perfect for reading, working, or studying (though i was here on a wednesday evening, so could be different other times). the music selection is also really good (an essential for a good coffee shop). the coffee itself is good, but not amazing. i tend to go for variations of different south american blends (colombian, brazilian, etc.) but this is definitely more along the lines of lattes, americanos, cortados, etc. - with a few specials like (iced or hot) vanilla bean.the only major downside for me was the service - it wouldn't be wicker park without a dash of elitism. i was greeted with a weird sense of entitlement and condescending demeanor, including getting asked: "do you know what that [my coffee drink] is?". thankfully, i'm not there to chat with the staff, so i got over this one negative aspect and focused on the good elements of this place.if any place had iron goddess of mercy... soldgreat atmosphere fast internet this place is so awesome. so don't come here because than it will be too busy. and i love this place just the way it is. the humans behind the register are usually really nice.1.21 gigawatts!  this place is a total time warp, so any child of the 80's should appreciate such fine kitsch as they have decorating the cafe. there is a delorean in the back, as you can see in the photo, as well as multiple smaller scale deloreans around on counters and shelves and such.  mogwais, smurfs(or is it smurves?) various old-school lunchboxes transport me to a time when we didn't wear seat belts and cell phones came with it's own backpack they were so huge.  i really like this place, i like the tea selection and the inventive coffee drinks.  the one thing i don't like?  there's an employee here who seems to either be extremely unhappy with his job or i remind him of some ghoulish figure from a nightmare of his, or maybe he hates the world?  or maybe he's had some kind of medical mishap that froze his face expressionless save for the contemptuous look in his eyes for those damned "paying customers".  i honestly don't know.  he did put a pretty kick ass leaf into my koopa troopa though, so thanks for that.  but maybe smile a little?  unless you physically can't, i don't think there's no reason to be a bit cheery if you work in a place that could possibly put a happy start or ending to hundreds of people's days.so other than the coffee and tea, they do have cookies and other pastries, along with those crazily priced macarons.  for some reason my wife loves to buy these.  i think they taste good and all and they are darned delicate, and i'm sure they're not easy to make, but i just feel a little like someones laughing when i buy a cookie the size of my thumb for a dollar or sometimes more.  if you come here i recommend the peanut butter koopa troopa, that is, as long as you aren't allergic to nuts.  i love peanut butter, so this drink is right up my alley, and isn't too chunky with the peanut love as with other peanut butter based coffee drinks i've had at other places.  it's a little like peanut butter cap'n crunch, cocoa crispies and coffee blended together.  this makes wormhole worth the trip.  one thing i didn't agree with, the bedrock, which is fruity pebble syrup with cereal milk and espresso over ice.  the drink is $3.75, and is advertised as 7 ounces,  i'm not sure if that's the actual fluid volume of the drink or if that is the size of the cup.  and it was a good drink; slight fruit sugariness with coffee, turns out to mesh pretty well.  i would just appreciate the the price lowered or the size enlarged.so if you're in the wicker area and are in need of a jolt of caffeine and nostalgia and a splash of hipster angst, come on down to wormhole.not a bad place to set up shop and work all day - if you can find a seat. great coffee, great lattes, great tea. but the seating isn't great and it can sure ruin your plan if you can't find a place to sit! the internet is reliable and the ambiance is fun.by far the coolest coffee shop ever. it has super unique decor, i mean they have the delorean from back to the future in their shop... a delorean!!! the service is top notch and everybody super friendly. the menu is just as unique as the decor. my two fave items are the peanut butter koopa troopa latte and the cosby classic.the only qualm i have with the place is the lightening. i don't find it conducive to studying. however, it's still a decent place to get work done.  overall, top notch establishment.loved the coffee here....however i'm not too sure about the pastries since i've seen bugs crawling around the counter top over the pastry display... nifty coffee cups and a fun scene.staff is very friendly and yes the delorean is cool. but the hordes of 20 somethings that linger here silently on laptops for hours on end make for a somewhat creepy vibe. after a few irritated glares while trying to have a conversation with my friends, i was ready to leave. maybe i am getting old, but i thought coffee houses were for getting jacked up on caffeine and talking a lot.ahhhh my favorite mocha in wicker park! thumbs up for the real espresso shots pulled at worm hole. on the more expensive side (all coffees more than $4) but worth the price. also love the ginger cookies and assorted cereals from my 1980's childhood.conveniently located off the 56 milwaukee bus line. really crowded and loud on the weekends, can be hard to study without headphones. also, tables are really dark for reading. really cold inside during the winter, so bundle up!  despite all this stuff, my favorite coffee shop in wicker park.loved this coffee shop. spacious, free wifi...wish i could camp here everyday. plenty of character. the honey bear latte was surprisingly tasty - recommend!i was in search of a coffee house to study for the july il bar exam which was not starbucks( sorry 'bucks but you were getting old). my fellow yelpers led me to the wormhole. i love this place! the barristas are warm and friendly, leading me to the appropriate beverage choice given my mood and personal tastes. they even decorate your latte with the swirls in your foam.  i had the peanut butter koopatroopa (say that 3x fast!!), which was a great drink! flavorful but not too sweet, i.e. i did not feel i was drinking dessert. additionally this shop boasts super clean bathrooms, comfy chairs as well as tables,  free wi-fi and fun 80's decor. from movie posters, to stuffed smurfs and ghostbusters gear, to yes a delorean. i personally loved their california raisins memorabilia. this place takes me back to my very early childhood, and makes me nostalgic for times when i did not have tests to study for!this is a great shop, but it is missing that final star because 1. lack of lighting, with only windows in front it feels very intimate- which is great for a post dinner date experience, not so great when you are trying to study at 12pm. 2. cost- if you think starbucks is expensive you haven't seen anything yet. the 12oz here is the large size (equivalent to the starbucks tall), which costs between $4-$4.75. (the average cost of a starbucks venti). if you are in bucktown give this place your business.excellent coffee and a pleasantly dark interior. offering up some amazing coffee and teas by skilled baristas. i'm an 80s kid and i love playing the retro games on that huge bulky tv in the back. always nice to sit in the front window to watch the world go by. excellent spot and excellent coffee!from the collection of cool 80's items i remember from my childhood, to the perfect designs on the top of my vanilla bean latte this place tops my list for favorite coffee stops/lounging areas. i am a morning regular and look forward to my my morning wormhole fix to kick the day off.  the vanilla bean latte is creamy, smooth, and delicious if you're looking for something to try.packed even on a thursday night. i gotta give it up to wormhole, their 80s themed décor and lattes are still pretty bitchin. i think they should play 80s music in keeping with the theme, instead of the millennial playlist they had going. overall, come to wormhole for the kitsch, stay for the coffee (if you can find a seat).exceptional coffee in a mug from the 90's, all of my favorite cereals (and the option to mix more than one) available, baristas who clearly love what they do, the option of sitting in a deep couch, on a stool at the bar or outside at a table, a cornucopia of good decor that distracts me from my work, and its convenient location on the wonderful and ever-interesting milwaukee avenue make wormhole coffee one of my favorite places in chicago. and it's generally always crowded so you are almost forced to share space (table, couch, etc.) with someone you don't know. so not only do you leave caffeinated and satiated, occasionally with a new friend too!some of the best coffee in town. if you are not sure about something, just ask one of the baristas. they are always up for giving recommendations, even when they're busy. if you're not in the mood for coffee, one of my favorite things is checking out their seasonal drinks. i think they have 3 or 4 a year and they are always delicious.hipster one "lets start a coffee shop identical to all the others in the area, except we just throw in some random 80's stuff."hipster two "yeah, like a nintendo and it would be sweet if we got a delorean."hipster one "totally. we wouldn't have to do anything in regards to customer service, quality of product, and can have terrible seating because people would think the place is cool because of the stuff on the walls."hipster two "so essentially we make a tgifridays for hipsters?"hipster one "bingo."though you must wait extremely long.. i do not mind one bit because it's always the most perfect, delicious vanilla latte! i always ask for their homemade syrup! the honey bear latte is yummy too!i love this place. the coffee is definitely 5 starts. i've had nothing but good experiences with the locally roasted halfwit beans they use. my only issue is that the place always seems to be ridiculously crowded and it can be impossible to find a seat. it's hard to really appreciate a fantastic cup of coffee in such a hectic place. i guess i'm faulting them for being too successful!i love how they put their entire focus into every cup they make. it's one of those things that separates good shops from great ones.i really like the ambiance of wormhole. if i were rating the crowd and the ambiance alone, i would give this place 5 stars. i mean, they have a delorean for christ's sake! they also have classic nintendo on a very large, monolithic boob tube. what's not to like? well, their specialty drinks are a bit pricey for the size, and they're really not that amazing. think starbucks. but if you want an amazing place to kill an afternoon, i think you will find this place to be perfect.love this place. the wait can be a tad bit long because the place is always busy and full of hipsters! i always get the vanilla bean latte and its amazing every time. the quality of the espresso beans are out of this world. best out of the local coffee shops i've tried.i liked this place more than i thought i would. i heard about it and pictured some weird nerd dungeon or something lol. but the decor was actually done fairly well and i like the open space. i had an awesome blackberry macaroon here. i ordered a vanilla bean latte, labeled as one of their best sellers. as a regular latte it was good but it had no vanilla flavor whatsoever so i don't know what that was all about. it didn't sink to the bottom either, just wasn't there. so make sure it actually tastes like vanilla. i like that you can get cereal there anytime. it was funny seeing someone order a bowl of cocoa puffs this evening lol. i do wish they had smaller tables as opposed to bigger tables because it is awkward sitting at a table with 5 other people at a cafe, just saying. i like the seats near the window though.i have been here a few times after my last review, and i have changed my opinion on this place. still not my number one wow coffee shop, but the staff is friendly, their goodies are tasty,  and they will resteep your tea for you for free. there aren't too many places to sit, but the chairs are generally comfortable, and there are a lot of outlets to choose from. no wonder this place is so popular, it's a solid coffee shop.this place is very cool!  i like the 80s theme.  the delorean is cool, as are the lunch boxes on the wall.  (i even had one of them when i was little!)i don't drink coffee, so i can't speak to that.  the bottled lemonade i had was good, as was the fresh iced tea i tried.the hummus veggie sandwich was completely lacking both hummus and veggies (as another reviewer stated).  however they don't make the sandwiches, so i wont fault them for that.the staff was really nice!so good.. i had honey bear latte and absolutely loved it! it had perfect thickness, just enough sweet and flavorful. will definitely come back while in chicago!to paraphase master yoda, "for the jedi it is time to drink as well." it master yoda was seeking out a cup of java in chicagoland i bet he'd come to wormhole. although you might think wormhole is all about fun memorabilia and a cool theme there's a ton of substance going on underneath that. i got a cup of coffee cherry tea. i had never even heard of such a thing. they take the dried cherries of a coffee plant and steep them to make an herbal tea. +1 for novelty, +1 for execution and wormhole really has something going on. my only disappointed was the guy in the back bogarting the nes. he looked like he hadn't moved for weeks and the only indication of any activity was the occasional flick of the thumb to get link closer to putting together that triforce. oh well, next time.ended up having to spend the night in chicago so made my way downtown. wow what a find! delicious latte and knowledgeable batista.i enjoy working here! not a coffee drinker but they have martinelli's apple juice!coffee is great and the atmosphere is cool and hippy. do not go to study or get any work done. there are not that many tables at all. would come back just for pre or post dinner hangout or just to read a book.even though i love the coffee they serve, i feel very unwelcomed when i order there by the employees. i visited three times, hoping each experience would be better. when i stand by the counter, i feel that they intentionally ignore me and even when i say excuse me, no one will respond. i really wanted to like this place but i do not like bad service. i rather take my business across the street where i am not judged.wormhole has earned my repeat business, 100%. they have earned it by consistently preparing the highest quality coffee they can find, bringing guest roasts from across the continent. their staff has earned it by being knowledgeable and helpful, especially when the shop is busy. they are personable without being sugary. they are attentive without being needy. they're the perfect coffeehouse staff. questionable content's coffee of doom staff has nothing on these folks.i suggest drinking your coffee in-house, if you can find a seat in this bustling wicker park location. if you've got a sweet tooth, any of their specialty lattes will please; each syrup is made in-house. if you are a true coffee geek, get a manual pourover. they have a row of v60s that they're using, and rumor is that they're planning on adding a vacpot or two to the line eventually. if you're in a hurry and can't stay, their auto-drip is always fresh, and with a top-of-the-line fetco, it's no diner coffee.the wonderful, retrotastic interior design will pull you back to the 80s in an instant. it's all very eclectic but only a close study of film release dates will expose that fact. this store is practically a museum of retro sci-fi movies.first heard about this place when a friend visiting from out-of-town suggested we check out the "coffee spot with a car parked inside". unfortunately my friend's schedule was too packed to fit this place in, but i was able to make it. it's very laidback, with whimsical memorabilia all over the place. the coffee is execellent and it took me a few seconds to realize those cups are not cumbled plastic cups! looks like a good place to hang out with a laptop or book or friends.best coffeehouse in town. great mix of high and low brow in regard to aesthetic, coffee choices (or a bowl of cereal) and the right mix of hip and local. the best seats in the house are the counter seats. great little hooks for your jacket and close to the action of the baristas laughing about inside jokes and making pour overs. was there the day it opened and unfortunately moved recently. but it'll always be the gold standard of coffeehouses. san fran is maybe the only city i've found that has coffeehouses to rival the good vibe. late hours, good for study or chit chat, always fun conversations with strangers. and one of the better places to read the new york times (the owner last time i was there was still buying sunday copies for everyone to use. wifi is fast and reliable compared to local counterparts (lovely, filter, caffe streets, alliance, colombe). if you bike and bring your own cup, you get free coffee in the morning for commuting. did i mention bowls of cereal?this place is awesome.  vanilla latte is incredible. the 80s theme keeps one visually engaged and the eclectic crowd is fun.  definitely a place to visit when in wicker park.my favorite place for coffee (other than dundo's). the atmosphere is perfection and i am here at least three times a week (to do hw and just get away from the craziness that is the loop). this is place is a must to go to if you live in chicago.  no questions asked.i will go with pretty good here.  i had chamomile tea, i wasn't up for evening coffee. the person working at the counter turned out to be from the same area of mi where i live, so that was a fun moment.  good times.  you may have to wait or look about for seating, this place is busy.hmmm, i dunno if the vibe of this place just makes me happy so that's why i am rating it so high or what, but i love this place.  if i lived in chicago, i would come here every day.  last trip, i think i went there five times over the course of three days.  first, space is awesome, with lots and lots of seating, nice and clean bathrooms, and nostalgic 80s memorabilia everywhere (and a delorean).  and an nes in the back fully stocked with games for anyone to use!  yes, life is good. coffee i found to be somewhat pricey but pretty decent.interesting novelty place.  worth checking out a few times.  they have a great tea selection and good coffee.the baristas resent their job, or at least interacting with people who want coffee.great coffee. delorean, ooo.  nintendo, yay. clever wi-fi passwords, tee hee.... but yeah. the baristas can be real d-bags, as others have mentioned. plus, it's smallish and finding a place to sit can be a real hassle during the day.my goodness. what delicious espresso!friendly service and a wonderfully funky, 80's vibe atmosphere.i will say, the floppy disks with the wifi password printed on them made me feel a bit old.loved this place. great atmosphere and even better coffee.they have a delorean in the window! they have the original nintendo! they have really old looking couches! they get their organic chocolate from an "adorable" old couple in rural illinois who make it in their home! they have cheeky, ethereal baristas who dress like they're homeless! they have obscurity for obscurity's sake! they have expensive lattes that come in teeny tiny cups! and, they even have the constant flow of regular daytime customers that probably should be saving their $0/year professional hipster salary and making coffee at home...but who can resist that kind of atmosphere?! wormhole reminds me of the tv show portlandia, which is set in portland, which is near seattle, which is where starbucks was founded, which has better coffee than wormhole.being a huge rpg fan/nerd, this place was heaven.  besides the decor winning my heart a thousand times over (chrono trigger magnets...yessss), my husband loved the coffee he ordered (he's a coffee snob), and i loved the tea thathese dudes are nothing but hardcore when it comes to coffee + tea.  i've been here a few times to study when i went through teacher training, and can i tell you that sitting at the bar is not a good idea because all you want to do is watch them make different stuff 394 different kinds of ways.they have jasmine tea here.  supes important to me, as a green tea drinker.  it is just warm and fuzzy, and you get a 2nd refill of hot water.  being a child of the 80s, of course the delorian is a killer way to decorate.  also, the calvin and hobbes artwork in the bathroom tickles that soft spot in my heart.minus one star. why?the delorean is gone. back to the future? perhaps.no, seriously. the delorean is gone now. sure, we have more space to sit now, but at what cost? i'll have a pepsi free. no, tab? something without sugar. coffee.update: correction, delorean is still there! i wrote my review from only passing by the wormhole on the sidewalk. there's a new bar, rearranged furniture, and more room than ever. seeing the delorean fixed above the bathrooms now, a single thought comes to mind:"roads? where we're going we don't need roads."i came here on a whim on a recent trip to chicago and loved it. i usually stick to straight-up drip coffee because i love it so much but their options were so cool and unique i was convinced to try the "cool but rude": a cappuccino made with curry and cardamom. it was just the right amount of sweet and basically the bomb. i sat at the bar and chatted with the friendly barista; people in general seemed to be happy and friendly (that's the chicago-ny comparison). decor is very cool, spacey and gamer. lots of seating, including comfy couches. on my way out i tried some kenyan drip and it was also great!good coffee, great ambiance!wormhole coffee is one of those perfect hot spots if you wanna get coffee, a muffin and work/surf the net. very cool art work on display. i especially like the calvin n hobbes one framed in the restroom. friendly staff and it has a wicker park vibe to it for sure. with places like these in town, its a crime to choose starbucks to hang out at. clear your schedule, carry a laptop and enjoy some "me" time!you walk in, see the delorean and think, 'wow, this is fucking awesome,' but then you start talking to the guy behind the counter. what changes?well, the guy behind the counter (in this instance, perhaps they have some great staff) was the very definition of pretentious. beneath his oh-so-hip hat stood five feet of "knowledge," describing as if to a toddler the nuances of chocolate and 'peanut butter' that make this roast stellar. this is all fine and good if his snobbery leads to a fantastic cup of coffee, but what i found instead was a poorly roasted, over priced cup of brown water. for four dollars, i would have been better off buying a bag of folgers and brewing it with river water. i don't know, maybe you are into that.i still give the place two stars because of both the atmosphere, and their methods. as far as i can tell they put in the effort, but just didn't deliver. i would also guess that their coffees are not all bad, the problem is you should be able to expect a certain level of consistency from this type of establishment.what's not to love about this place?  cool shit on the walls, strong coffee, efficient service.  call me simple.upon entering one will ask: why dedicate what could amount to floor space for four tables in a crowded coffee shop to a back to the future styled delorean.  i actually don't like the posters tacked up on the walls, that everyone seems to admire.  it reminds me more of a boy's bedroom in the mid 80s.  but hey, it gets people walking through the door.  its the coffee that keeps everyone coming back.i've been here a few times, ordering a latte, espresso, and pour over coffee.  every drink has been delicious.  they take the modern scientific approach with exact measurements by weight of beans/water and exact temperature of the water.  this creates consistency, that is why they are consistently good.  i chatted it up with the nice barista while she did my pour over and she gave me some helpful tips for home brewing.  the staff is awesome coffee is awesome, but if you get burnt out on hipsters, you might want to take your drink to go.coffee was okay but the staff and vibe is great. love the vintage touches and space for studying, laptop hangs and bar chairs for sippin'. would come back (if ever in town again).how have i not done a review for the wormhole yet?! i stop in whenever i go to the bongo room which i can't do too often because i will get fat.i love taking people here, it's a really great atmosphere. however, i hadn't been in awhile and when i took a friend there last saturday morning i was suprised to see the rehab on this place. for starters, i miss the delorean in the front window, but it's nice that there's extra seating there. i also miss my ferris bueller/griswold family-esque basement couch so i can play paperboy and contra. there are fewer gremlin toys too.other than that, it's still cute and a hipster place to go too. it can get crowded at times as people fight for space to get on the wi-fi. i don't drink coffee but from what i've been told it's really good. i stick to the cocoa and i like the designs they make with the foam- it makes me feel special. i've had a muffin from there before and it was also really good. i will definitely come back, but i miss more of the 80s stuff they used to have around the place.the decor is cool. that is the only reason i give this place one star instead of petitioning yelp to add a zero star rating. i came at 10:30 on labor day. the girl at the register was nice (although she forgot my muffin), but the generic dark-haired hipster dude making the coffee was awful. as i stood waiting for my wife's chai latte (rung up as a "chai uh lebuff". i promise i wanted to like this place), i witnessed him tell another couple that it was their fault he had dumped their drinks because they had not heard him announce their drinks from across the busy coffee shop (mind you, the staff was announcing drinks only to a corner of the shop at volumes more appropriate for a library). he grudgingly agreed to make their drinks again, complaining the entire time. as they put my wife's drink on the counter, another woman immediately grabbed it and stuck it in her mouth. she gets zero stars for human decency. i could not get the staff's attention, at which point my wife walked up to figure out why her latte had not come out for 20 minutes. i explained the situation to her, and went to drink my now-cold coffee. when (i assume) that woman's latte came out, another dude tried to claim it from my wife. when she said it was her's, the evil hipster dude said that she had probably missed her's and he had probably "chucked it" because she was not paying attention, and when she insisted that was not the case he turned his back and told her to work it with the other guy.there are more than a few places to get coffee in this neighborhood. we were just visiting chicago, but i definitely would never, ever come again. i like my coffee with sugar and cream, not scorn and derision. take your business elsewhere.best coffee house in chicago, hands down. i already added a tip but am now writing a review to give props to this awesome place. no complaints here, just the triple threat of good coffee, good service, good atmosphere. we didn't even get hipster attitude from the baristas--an annoying aspect of most wicker-ukie-logan joints that is pleasantly absent here. more than espresso, they have everything here, from chemex to pourovers to a variety of teas. the pastries are unique and amazing. the fun '80s pop culture decor is totally awesome.wormhole is my absolute favorite for coffee shops in the city. my only real complaint-and let's get it out of the way now-is they're too popular. now, i could just order to go, but a major positive feature of wormhole's is their decor; i require a substantial amount of creative stimulation, so being in that 80s-clad space with star wars mugs, 80s movie posters-both classic and not so much, nintendo cartridges and castle grayskull replicas (!) satisfies that need.so, also, there's coffee. and the honeybear latte has set a new standard for me in the category "hot brewed beverage"-i pretty much go the poor man's route anywhere else now and just squeeze entire containers of honey into a large latte (special shout-out to honey: it's amazing).i snuck in and had your iced vanilla latte. it was delicious.i love the new interior by the way. exceptionally better than before!great coffee & ambiance. above-par-hipster service included. i highly recommend this for visitors.wormhole is really the place to go to do work/homework. a lot of seating area including couches and it's open till 11pm. overall, the coffee/lattes are good. sometimes seems crowded but only takes a minute or two for a seat to open up in my experience.whoever came up with the idea for the wormhole needs to run for public office. that's the kind of brain we need to pull this country out of the financial rut that it's in, lower the crime rate and maybe even make the digital television signal more stable. basically this person watched vh1's i love the 80s and went, "i think that could be a café!" the wormhole has quite a bit to look at on the inside. lunchboxes along the shelves, old toys and gadgets scattered throughout the place, an nes hooked up to a wood panel television set, and a real goddamn delorean parked right by the front door. i was having a hard time holding a conversation with my friend because i was too busy looking around and counting how many of their toys i had as a kid. i can't comment on their specialty drinks because i only drink regular black coffee, but it was one of the best damn cups of coffee i've had in a while: piping hot and full of flavor without that over roasted starbucks taste. it wasn't cheap, but it was still a better value than the big name coffee chains.my only problem with this place is that, despite the ample seating, it gets full pretty fast. but i guess that's to be expected because, honestly, why would you want to leave?love the neighborhood! perfect coffee house in a very urban and cute area.seats and tables were nicely arranged and spread out.  counter tops were comfy as well.coffee was good! my soy latte was def enjoyable.this place wins major bonus points for its 1980s-inspired decor. movie posters, nintendo gaming system and a delorean! definitely stop by!the coffee was pretty good - try the honeybear soy latte.but my favorite part was sitting on the comfy basement-style couch and playing super mario with my boyfriend and a stranger on a grandparents-style console tv. it's a trip to the past.am i seeing strawberry shortcake lunch boxes? am i seeing a full-size delorean, like they got in that michael j. fox flick? this here is the wormhole---someplace between borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered 80s and your local dive.now these cats don't mess around. they got an ambitious dark roast coffee. it's got a nice taste y'know. bitter, and earthy. buy one of them vegan doughnuts, you'll be getting your nice and plenty right there.now this here citrus mocha. i'd recommend it, but save it for when you need a sugary treat. you know, like a valentine's day present to your sauce, or if you have young ruffians in need of a sugar spike, this they might like. it was a little too much for me, but i gather there's a time and place.so yeah, stop on in. stay long enough, you won't just be thinking back about the 80s, you'll be living there.came to try the nitro coffee after having beatrix's nitro earlier that day. beatrix takes the cake on this one, no nitro mouthfeel to wormholes take on the nitro coffee, pretty disappointing. cool atmosphere though!i was a little confused when i walked in but then i saw the delorean parked inside. i must have blasted to the past! i was greeted by gizmo! love my gizmo! this cafe makes a 20-30 year-old reminisce about their childhood. i zoned out by staring at all of the fun retro little gadgets including a nintendo and sooo many games!  i literally felt like i walked into a 80s movie set!  sitting by the window, i saw longboarders ride by and a huge bear-like dog just chilling out on the sidewalk leashless.the music is insanely awesome. they don't have caramel so i ordered the peanut butter koopa troopa which was delicious. fruity pebble pastry?!? could it get any better?! im so transfixed on this cafe! walking by it you would think its a dump, boy was i wrong! i totally want to go back!i've only been here twice.  i'll leave the ambiance descriptions to johnny t et all.  you really must check it out.  i had a coffee drink the first time that was well-made but didn't strike me enough to remember it clearly.  however, several months ago we stopped in here and i got the tomahawk (a mate tea, frothed milk. and some serious spicyness.)  it was the most interesting and delicious drink that i've ever had.  you think i'm being dramatic, but i really mean it.at first i thought that wormhole was mostly about their unique interior and might be able to stay in business just because cereal and a delorean will bring people back even if the drinks aren't outstanding.  but they really are.  i wish i lived closer, but you can bet that if i'm in the area i'll be back to try another one of their cocktails.  they're like the kuma's of coffee shops; just being there is an experience but they're ready to kick your ass with their great food/drinks too.the coffee and drinks are very good, and the décor is amazing! but one thing that is always so glaringly distracting is the overwhelming feeling of coffee shop judgment while i'm in there. it starts with the staff. i get this sense from the time they greet me that i am somehow inconveniencing them with my order and general presence. then, you get it from your fellow coffee shop people. and you would think that in this nerd-themed coffee shop that you would find other like-minded nerds who want to speak to other nerds. but i didn't. i just received more cold stares. this has happened several times to me and i'm at the point of walking in and yelling, "what is the matter in here? where are my people? looks are so deceiving!" and walking right back out.one and done.i was excited to visit this place.  i mean, it has a delorean!  but you can barely see it; it's tucked above the bathrooms in the back.  and other than that, and a few trinkets here and there, the theme is... sort of bare.the coffee we had was good, though not as flavorful as i thought it would be, and the cup was tiny.  like, a tea cup.  way too small for the price.the cashier was pretty friendly and patient while my friend decided between whatever gluten-free pastries they had.the thing that kills it for me is the ambiance.  i bet this place is nice when it's empty, but unfortunately it wasn't... really wasn't... when we were there.  every spot in the place was taken by a hipster typing away at his or her iphone or macbook, a veritable sea of loose-knit sweaters, frayed overprocessed hair, flesh tunnels, and doc martens.  no one was talking to each other; you could've heard a pin drop if it weren't or the whrrrr of the espresso machines.  just a room full of people staring at screens.we had to stand in the middle of the floor holding our coffee, enduring the stares of the crowd because i, in my infinite fashion wisdom, was wearing a full-length wool coat that totally wasn't vegan.  eventually we were able to score a seat in the back, but unlike the rest of the crowd, we didn't feel comfortable enough there to linger.  the woman next to us kept peering at me over her iphone.  we wanted to snag one of the gaming consoles but every flat surface in the area was covered with someone instagramming (and ignoring the consoles at their knees).  the moment we'd emptied our cups, we were out the door.  the cold weather outside was more inviting.wormhole! come to detroit! please!!! ah, i would have lived in this place if it were near me in college. holy smokes. a delorean parked in the window? a living room setup with the original nintendo? various star wars toys, 80's movies posters & ritual coffee and sugar cereals?! old lunch boxes adorning the walls?! my god. i have died and gone to nerd heaven. the nostalgia that adorned every wall had me struck with a silly grimace the whole time i was in there. so, the coffee! i got the cappuccino. top notch. if you've never had ritual coffee, then this is your chance to see what's so special about it. for those of you who don't know, ritual is known for solid, great tasting coffee. at wormhole, it's done up proper barista style with a pretty little heart on top. that milk was frothed to froth perfection. and of all things in a place like this, they had pistachio macaroons. for a dollar?! um yes & yum. i can't get enough of the way they did up the place. it's like someone put a coffee shop in one of my gamer friends basements. my husband and i were inspired to have an old school nintendo game night solely based off of our visit. it felt so welcoming & home like in there. they had some great music playing as well. not to mention it's located in a great area of wicker park, steps away from some great shops. but why would you want to leave? bring a book, laptop or just relax...play some old school nintendo...the staff was super friendly too. great coffee, one of a kind atmosphere. i think it's safe to safe to say. this wormhole sucked me right in. a well deserved, solid, shining 5 stars.the coffee is decent--i do like their chai lattes--but i always feel like i'm being judged for not being hipster enough when i walk in. i've had their pastries as well and they were also just ok.stopped by after reading so much about the decor and atmosphere. really enjoyed the geek inspired theme even down to the names and designs on the menu. a little crowded so we took up a little counter against the window. overall a great environment to get work done and chill.good coffee, cool and nostalgic knock knacks, and nintendo games!! we had a blast hanging out here, and someday i'll come back to try the ginger-curry latte!drawn in by the delorean, i have been to the wormhole three times. i really want to like this place. but each time i've been there, i have felt unwelcome -- not by the other patrons, but by the staff, who have perfected the blasé  "we're popular so we don't have to be nice " attitude. they don't smile or greet,  and they seem really annoyed to have to serve. i feel like i am imposing on their conversation or something. i see from other reviews that my experience is not typical. maybe they don't like me because i order crazy concoctions, such as a the single shot latte i tried for yesterday. i was told that they "don't do that" so i opted instead for iced tea, which was served with abundant tea leave floaters. it was awful.  i tossed the tea about two blocks away. i found a place called buzz (on damen). no delorean, but i was welcomed and served a single shot latte with a smile. and it was really good. three strikes, you're out, wormhole.the latte here was legit - pretty busy place. in addition to the coffee, the decor at wormhole was interesting considering the back to the future delorean hanging off the ceiling in the back!i love wormhole - great coffee, charming owner, delicious baked goods - what more could you want on a cold chicago morning! well maybe a few savory eats when i don't feel like the raspberry corn muffin, which is just about one of the best things in the world. go wormhole!the wormhole is the type of place you go to get lost in another world, be it a book, a game of a super nintendo, or a conversation. there's lots of good coffee out there, but there aren't too many atmospheres like this one.in the heart of wicker, a more chill spot than the hustle n bustle crowds and hipster venues, lies the brick and mortar space of the wormhole! plastered with classic movie posters such as ghostbusters, weird science, gremlins and the untouchable the goonies, along with indie/great music, and collectible toys such as gizmo, darth cadre and the delorean!!!!, it makes this spot one-of-a-kind!! it feels like the ideal childhood bedroom study-room/sanctuary, with a mini-kitchen and friendly and knowledgable staff. if you have add your mind would be thanking you for such nostalgic eye candy (if you were an 80s baby or before). a must see establishment. hope this place stays around longer than it's memorabilia! if you live in or around wicker, this is the cool spot for the nerd inside you!a tasty selection of specialty drinks. i mostly just take it to go because there is never any seating due to all the seat hoggers with their laptops. literally looks like a computer lab at some points of the day. when you do get a seat, the place is a great chill spot. lots of things to look at and it's definitely a nostalgia trip.freaking delicious coffee.  gets super packed, but it's pretty cool when you can sit.  the atmosphere can get a little weird in this place sometimes.. every year seems to be a little freakier.peanut butter latte drink was so so so good. i went in with my disabled daughter, which was uncomfortable because (1) it's not easy to get in and out of the door with her walker, and (2) this is not a kid-friendly place. it's a hipster friendly place, so hipsters at the record store in the next block without kids recommend it to people with kids because of the 80s throwback decor. haha. but as someone who was a teenager in the 80s, i can tell you that comfortable, accessible seating makes a place kid-friendly. in spite of that, i loved this place. i will go back if i am ever wandering around without my daughter. a native foods is on the corner. i wish i could go back to this place right now and hang out all day with my laptop and pretend i am not 43, but a 23 year old who wishes they had been a teenager in the 80s. sigh.free wi-fi and open til 11pm can't really be beat, but there's also a nintendo in the back that you can play with a ton of games to choose from. so it's not just nostalgia!their food/pastries generally run out by the evening/night. when i arrived around 7:30pm, they were down to 2 ginger molasses cookies. it was super good, which makes me want to go directly to fritz (where they order from) and choose from the full selection. they mark up the prices at wormhole, but that's to be expected.they do offer bottomless coffee, but it's just ok. i'll have to try something else next time.a nice selection of coffees and lattes, but not only that, there's the selection of brewing methods depending on the coffee. pretty cool. most importantly, the coffee was good.  the ordering process was simple (and not intimidating) and the service was very polite--even smiling--in spite it being a very busy saturday afternoon.  this may not be the place for you if you're looking for a relaxing place to have conversation with a friend or two on the weekend. every seat was full and it seemed that nearly everyone had a laptop or tablet.this place reminds me of something you would find in downtown portland, oregon because it is just that cool.  also, if you are a child of the 80's, it is like going back in time.   the games from being a kid are everywhere and you can't help but stare at everything that this place has collected over the years.  the highlight is the delorean from back to the future that takes over the back of the coffee shop.  i happened not to order coffee the one time i went so i can't speak on that but for the vibe alone, this is a must try.my husband and i visited the wormhole because a former michigander now turned chicagoan suggested we check the place out. as a coffee lover and self proclaimed coffee snob, my recommendation is that if you're in the neighborhood, you should definitely stop here for an amazing espresso or latte. and if once here, you discover that you're into the back to the future theme, etc., then stay. personally, i got my coffee to go and was quite happy to have made the stop for an amazing latte. (also, my husband was quite happy with his espresso!)1.  comfy couches.2.  good espresso, lighter than usual roast (which i like)3.  wonderfully insane decor, highlights include a live old nintendo set that you can actually play, a spanish poster for octopussy, a giant e.t. doll, some kind of mounted automobile, and, oh fuck, i can't describe this joint.  just go there.  win.when fritz bakery was sold out of vegan donuts they sent us over here,, 5 stores down from native foods so we made a day of it and the kids couldn't have been happier.the staff is actually friendly (a first for me at a coffee house), the vintage decor is a hoot since it is all from my era and the boys loved the delorean (having never seen b2f they had no idea what it was but when we said time machine they nearly pooped themselves). watching them try to play games on an original  nintendo had to be the highlight of my day - paperboy!did i mention the hot apple cider? this place is always packed.i can't believe this place has averaged 4.5 stars.it's just meh,there are some fun things, nintendo to play and a delorean to check out but the service is not that great, not that quick and not that friendly.there is a lot of seating but it's often crowded.the thing that stood out to me most about wormhole is the amount of care they take in crafting each drink. every drink they served seemed like a work of art and almost too pretty to consume!  they make all of their syrups in house which is cool, and i had an iced soy chai which was very good and spicy. for food they have a selection of unique pastries and sandwiches.  lots of tables with trendy people on computers, all of which were macs.i must have been a dog in my past life because if there is peanut butter within three miles, i am on it.  get the peanut butter koopa troopa and thank me later.  frakkin' amazing.i had a friend visiting from out of town so we came here because we're childrens of the 80's, and it was just probably the best thing i've seen in a while.  it is definitely 80's sensory olverload, but it's great.  someone was playing paper boy when we came in and i wanted in on that so badly, but the places was packed. we were lucky to find a place to sit.definitely go here.  they're awesome.  wicker park is super out of my way, but this will definitely be an "every few weekends" stop.  and the bathrooms are super clean.as soon as i walked in, i noticed that the space seemed a bit different... 1. there was a clear line to order as soon as you enter.2. the car was gone from the middle of the floor to the rear top space. 3. more bar seat area to the side.4. wider behind the counter space!!!!i haven't been here in a while, but stopped in with my boyfriend yesterday and apparently, it was their first day back since closing for remodeling for 2 week!it's always very crowded here, and all of the available seats were taken, but the space definitely seemed to be more open and spacious!it was definitely very busy here and good for them!downside was that it did take a while to get my boyfriend's small latte... i on the other hand, ordered noble's ecuador pour over and it was yummy! got it way before my boyfriend's latte.this is my favorite coffee shop in the city, and i've been to many! wormhole has everything working for it: a great location, friendly, well-trained staff, and a memorable atmosphere that will delight any '80s novelty junkie. the coffee and tea selections are both impressive and expertly-crafted, and there are alternative drinking options to boot (boxed water, apple juice, etc). the pastry case, while small, boasts some of the most creative offerings i've come across in my travels (think peanut-butter-chocolate-chip-pretzel cookies--a well-worth it treat!). if you haven't been, i strongly suggest you get yourself over to wicker park and try out this gem of an establishment. they're typically open from 7am-11pm, so time is on your side! ;)i don't always drink coffee, but when i do, it's at the wormhole. i've been here enough and *disclaimer* i know travis, an owner of this joint.i know him well enough that he wouldn't do anything remotely close to what matt l scathed about, much less lie about it in his response, but i digress.don't let a crybaby deter you from visiting here.let people like him go off to the big corporate chains like starbucks that ship their cash miles away to corporate hq; it's all for the better because the regular clientele here provide an intelligent, calm, and quiet atmosphere; it's local, the fare is excellent, and it has one of the more unique and original decor and vibes of any coffee shop (be it local or listed on a stock exchange somewhere).i really really wanted to like this place more.  first of all i love coffee, the 1980's, various hand brewed options, and 80's video games.  however, despite the ample seating, it seems as if people lounge the entire day, so getting a seat was challenging.  the biggest reason for the low rating, however, is clearly the staff.  the most rude, unhelpful, arrogant service i have maybe ever received.  i asked the cashier about the various options of hand brewed pour over techniques and what coffees offered strong, bold flavors.  i was told, "you should just get a drip coffee."  if i wanted a drip coffee at these prices, i would have went to caribou or a gas station for that matter (not that i would actually ever drink gas station coffee).  it was as if he didn't want to take the time to help me learn about their business and coffee options.  it was like i was a nuisance instead of a customer willing to span $4-5 for coffee and tip for a pleasant experience.  then when my coffee was finished, the called out a different name as opposed to what i ordered.  when i asked if it was mine, another employee stated, "it's yours!"  shoving the drink at me to get me out of the way.  finally, as i was ready to leave, i asked if there was a bin to place my mug in and again, i was met with rude behavior and all i was trying to do was make their job easier.  it is really unfortunate that the staff is so rude, because the coffee and decor are absolutely fantastic.i highly recommend going to ipsento or asado instead.  very friendly and helpful staff at these places that will give you a wonderful experience, great customer service, and great coffee with out the attitude.as good as coffee gets. the decor makes you feel like your are having coffee with mcfly and other cool cats. if i lived in the area i would be drinking coffee instead of water, mixing shakes with coffee, cooking noodles in coffee, washing my mouth with coffee ... you get the point.solid coffee shop.if i lived closer to  here then i would definitely bring my laptop or book and post up. which seems to be the same idea that everyone else had, because it was so crowded on sunday night!tried the peanut butter koopa troopa, which was a bit rich and not my favorite. also had the vanilla bean latte, which was awesome! they dont have a lot of syrup flavors and no sugar free pumps, so if a certain chain coffee shop is your thing then this might not  be.the 80s decor is awesome. played mario on the couch with my friends for a bit. my friend geeked out over the movie posters and the delorean in the entry. love it.the koopa troopa mocha is kind of life-changing. i wish there was more seating, but the wicker park laptop crew kind of takes over on week ends. nevertheless, i always stop in for a fix when i'm in the 'hood and i've found that even the most clueless hipster is willing to give up a seat at the video game couch when i'm there with my son in his super mario hat. macarons from fritz pastry is the icing on the cake.i have consumed a soy latte at this location. i declare it officially good. they did not have the hazelnut syrup i requested, and they said something about making their own syrups or some such thing. that's groovy that they make things from scratch, but they should bust open some hazelnuts and make some syrup out of them while they're at it. i appreciate that they are not starbucks, and likely don't have stockholder meetings where they discuss quarterly dividends and such.  and i enjoy that an employee named travis politely responds to all the cracknuts that post wacky reviews on . and thank you for building a pyramid of wood to ramp that delorean up on top of your back room. every coffee shop should have a quirky car mascot.i really like the wormhole. firstly, their coffee is great! some of the best i've had in chicago. or anywhere.secondly, it looks really fun and funky. if you like nerdy things from the 90's you'll enjoy the wall work.i've been walking by this place for a while now and have been wanting to check out wormhole. after a crappy morning this was exactly what i needed. the baristas were friendly, helpful, and not condescending at all. i had a truly well-made latte and a deliciously moist blueberry muffin (with lots of big blueberries!). neither of which can be found from any corporate coffee place. seriously, have any of those starbucks executives ever had a real latte? just sayin'.as a non-hipster who barely remembers the 80's (because i was young - not because i was having a good time) i wasn't sure i would be cool enough for wormhole. but this place is great. it's really spacious and at 8:30 on a weekday it wasn't busy. the music was not too loud. you can definitely have a conversation or use headphones without having to compete with the music. i think i'll be back again. there's probably a joke to be made about going back to the future through the wormhole...but i'm not that big of a nerd.came here to get some work done, meet a friend, and enjoy some good coffee.   seating can be tight - there is plenty of seating, but can be pretty crowded.   i took a spot at a shared work table, fired up the laptop and free wifi (look for the password on old floppy disks stored near the register - clever idea, but really looooonnng password!) and had an americano.    pretty good.    the sci fi theme is, well, kitschy and fun.    also tried an iced honey latte which was good, too.  sat outside on a nice day.   decent place to work/meet, with decent coffee.    hipster vibe.not your average coffee shop this 'wormhole' or the 'hole'.  this place screams retro with a 'back to the future' car inside the store, star wars posters, gremlins and  a nintendo 8 bit video game where you can play the very first super mario bros. the staff is very helpful ( i would put it as knowledgeable) about the concoctions they are brewing and hole atmosphere is very chilled out and relaxed. my favorite  potion is the rocket sauce, which is an iced tea made from of yerba matte, ginger syrup and lime juice. a must try   next time you're in wicker park give this place a try.tasty late.  cool decor.  very yummy pretzel cookie.  never seen one before but the soft, crunchy, chewy, and saltiness of it all works for me.  i grabbed one before heading over to wait in line at hot dougs.i was staying with my friend in wicker park over july 4th weekend, and this is probably one of my favorite joints from the weekend.i ordered the honey bear latte with soy and peanut butter koopa troopa. solid concoctions. the star wars public health message to parents who don't immunize their children. love. along with the rest of the ambience/decor. definitely a space in which i could get lost in my studies or reading.love. love. love. the wormhole gives you everything you ask for in a coffee shop experience and then some. first off, as the other reviews say, there is a delorean with han solo chillin next to it. need i say more? what's even better about the vibe of this cafe is the coffee itself! their solid selection and unique offerings truly set this place apart.so i don't like coffee or anything else you would get in a cafe to drink. but, i'm fascinated by the stuff and i figured i'd give it another shot. you need to drink it a couple times to get the "acquired" taste right? i went to worm hole because they are the closest cafe--open latest--that sells reputable coffee stuff on a sunday night. i got the cappuccino? whoever was working the register (a dude) round 8pm. good job. thanks for teaching me more about this stuff. i felt like a 3rd grader walking into a calculus lecture. i'm still not a pro, but...well yeah..i'm still not that great. the cappuccino was not horrible. and i mean that in a good way. i mean, i don't like coffee, and this wasn't too bad. oh! i also had the vegan cupcake. yeah that was really good. 5 stars for the service, thanks for taking the time man.ten thousand reviews for this place so i'll keep it short and sweet: all the other stuff is true. and there are vegan donuts in the morning? the vegan boston creme donut is the best fucking donut i've had in my entire life and it sells out fast so it is now my life's quest to get another one.the best thing in all of chicago. go. it is perfect and cozy and welcoming and everything great. you wont be disappointed, i promise. stay till closing and eat all of their give away pastries!my friends had been talking about this coffeeshop for ages, so when i found myself in the area, i wandered over. i loved the coffee. the atmosphere is very great and just as hipster-esque as my friends described to me. the music was perfect -- not too obnoxious and a great vibe. there was even a game console in the back and plenty of seating space all around.the thing that really irked me were the number of heads that turned as my five friends and i walked in. i couldn't tell if it was because we had such a large group and the place was already crowded, or because we were all asian. either way, the looks were the part of the entire experience that was the least welcoming for me. aside from that, the baristas were friendly albeit very rushed and busy. the seating was great and a welcome respite from the cold outside.my sunglass shields failing to protect me from the brutal rays of a hungover sunday morning star, i ducked in here for some vitamin caffeine.how anyone on this planet could be so darn nice that early is as beyond my grasp as the american flag on the moon, but they were and it: made. my. darn. morning. do they have a way to pump in aerosolized quaaludes through the ventilation system? everyone here seems so unnaturally calm for people who are around coffee all the time. the serene smile of the barista was transferred to me along with my simple paper cup of guatemalan. i took a sip and felt the words of the guy in the movie who takes the first snort off a switchblade to test the cocaine slip from my mouth: "it is pure."this place sucks.  don't go there.  i say this because i don't want anyone else to go there.the employees are great as long as you're not a jerkass,  i think most of them know their coffee pretty well, and don't just go through the motions when brewing your shit.they also know i'm addicted to certain pour overs, and i get the overflow from other people's brew if they're feeling generous.  i'm almost embarrassed by that fact, but i have no pride, so whatever.also some idiot savant popped in contra on the nes and tore through it in 20 minutes and didn't die once.  amazing.great coffee and tea. friendly service.  relaxing atmosphere.  love the delorean and 80s decor!  cool spot to hang solo or catch up with a friend.cofficer [kof-is-er] - a person who uses a cafe as their office. usually for several hours at a time.this place is lousy with em (including yours truly on rare occasions) but the key to being a good cofficer is putting money in the buy-something meter and ordering every couple or few hours. laptop gazers aside you shouldn't have any trouble finding somewhere to sit. there's plenty of power outlets and except for the stereo the place is pretty quiet.the cream and sugar are under the flux capacitor and while there is a delorean it can't do much without said flux capacitor. i should also mention that this is one of your best bets as far as coffee hangouts in wicker park. filter, also a great coffee joint, was gone for a looooooooong time and while it's back something isn't quite right nostalgia aside. maybe because it's not as grimy-looking as it was and it's not on that iconic corner anymore.i stopped in again a month or so ago and marvelled at the renovations! the delorian is now in the back and up high, the tv/nintendo is in the back, and the space is much more open with more seating and a different feel to it. i like it. the bathroom door is also fixed. i had a coffee, a sandwich, and some sort of muffin/cinnamon roll that was fantastic! good stuff - i'll stop in again soon when i'm in wicker park!i'm visiting from florida and i pre-searched a bunch of place for my visit to chicago and i have to share about how awesome this place is. original coffee recipes and very chill atmosphere.this is probably the chillest cafe i've ever been to. i ordered a funky named drink that had peanut butter and chocolate in it and i was not disappointed. it's pretty big too and provides comfy couches so i'll definitely be back here.the wormhole is definitely a cool spot to get a great cup of coffee.  the decor, which include gizmo dolls from gremlins and the badass delorean from back to the future, just adds to the experience here.  coffee wise, half witt is the main roaster represented here.  they also often offer roasts from guest roasters such as kickapoo from western wisconsin and ritual from sf.    coffee comes in the drip variety, but also can be individually prepared through the chemex, v60 pour over, or the aeropress.  my drinks have always been solid.my experiences have been very good up until today.  i've hit many of the better coffee roasters and cafes around the country (if you couldn't tell by all my cafe reviews), and all the people in charge of the brewing the individual cups were able to handle, at the minimum, two orders at a time.  the barista at the intelli i hit up as a regular can do 4+ with perfection.  in any case, the person in charge at the wormhole today was seriously only making an individual order at a time.  i ended up waiting nearly 25 minutes for my coffee!  damn, it took my ortho just a little more than that to perform an arthroscopic procedure on my shoulder!  in any case, i was super irked, and the barista realized how pissed i was just from my body language.  well, what she did should be the thing any business should do to resolve a customer issue........a simple, sincere apology.  it was also a very nice gesture for her to give me a free drink card for my next visit, which wasn't necessary since the apology went a long ways for me.  i'm a stickler when it comes to service, and i was planning on never returning and taking my business to caffe streets nearby.  i do purchase a 12 oz bag of coffee weekly, and i realize that isn't a whole lot, but for a business, it's much easier to keep a very loyal customer than to seek out a replacement.  kudos to the wormhole for making customer service a priority.i thiink the wormhole deserves some constructive criticism scattered in amongst the endless rave reviews. this isn't to say i dislike the place, and i'm sure i'll be back, but i simply cannot get as excited about this coffee shop's existence as everyone else.first, the positives. it's a comfortable space, albeit a crowded one, and if your tastes run to the dorktastic, you'll love the '80s decor (i think it's really over the top and tacky, but it's not like you have to pay attention to the geek paraphernalia if you don't want to). the baristas are friendly and efficient, and at least when i was there the music was at a very reasonable volume and was a good mix of indie and, of course, '80s hits. if you can score a seat it's a good place to hang out, get caffeinated, and read/play on your laptop/whatever. now, the downside. first of all, this place does get insanely crowded. there was actually a line to even use the bathroom. i'm sure this comes and goes according to the time of day, but don't expect to get a seat immediately. secondly, and this is the real killer for me, their standard brewed coffee is just subpar. yes, it's metropolis, and yes, that's a good roaster, but here it was acidic and, worst of all, served warm at best...certainly not hot. perhaps their specialty drinks are better, but a place that can't deliver a basic cup of coffee properly is not a place i would go out of my way to support.excited to try this place because it was on 190 north and seemed to have pretty good reviews....unfortunately i was disappointed.  i ordered two lattes, as soon as i walked to my car i took a sip, my latte was mildly hot and the other luke warm.  not to mention they're a little pricey.. $4 8oz latte i'd expect it to be better than starbucks but i was not impressed with the flavor or strength.  i'll give em' another shot, maybe just get a coffee next time but for now i was not so pleased.  on the other hand great atmosphere...this place is awesome, i only wish i had been hungry as well as jonesin for some caffeine when i went in there.  the baked goods looked amazing!!! but alas, i just ordered a drip coffee, and it was awesome!  i also liked that they had soy milk available near the rest of the "dress your coffee" station of items, i'm not normally a soy milk in my coffee girl at coffee places as its usually kept behind the counter so i was glad to see it. as for the atmosphere...wonderful.  the 80's video game and other decor was fantastic.  the nostalgic feeling one gets alone is worth at least walking into this place for a few minutes.  i'm from out of town but if i'm ever around again i'll be sure to go back to wormhole.this coffee shop is full of 80s type decor. it even has the car from back to the future and a nintendo for people to play with. the coffee is strong and tasty, i especially like the daily brews and iced citrus mocha. they have cupcakes, muffins, and even their own version of pop tarts. the customer service is really friendly and there is a good amount of seating inside and outside. it's also right next to the bongo room so it's a great place to grab a coffee before or after brunch.worm hole is like no other.  from the hipster ambiance to the 80's decor, this is no cookie-cutter coffee shop.  large, open area provides an ideal study area (although, being an 80's nintendo fan, studying is not my top priority here).  great place to chill out, and not feel like your over-staying your welcome, the staff is welcoming and attentive.  even during the a busy street festival they let me and some friends use the restroom and just hangout to get away from the crowds on the street for a while.cozy place, good coffee, great vibe, friendly people. i love coming here and appreciate the service!this place is another must-visit on my chi town list, although you can easily walk by the place. it's always completely packed. if you have been the san francisco, this place is chicago's version of four barrel. it's a cool-looking crowd, bike friendly, and they don't mind if you plug your computer in and stay for awhile. the outdoor seating is pretty awesome too. i have had both the peanut butter (swoon) and the vanilla latte. i'm a sucker for homemade syrups, and this place does them well. of course, the decor is unique and targeted to the perfect hip customer. the only thing that takes a way a star is the macaroon i ordered this time. while cute and supposedly "rose" flavored, i could only eat half because it was so bland and fake-tasting. i'll just stick to the coffee from now on.came here and ordered tea to go because i was sick. it took nearly 10 minutes (!) to get my tea, and when it came out it was in a mug for sit down. i tried to tell the closest barista to let them know my order was wrong, and in a very unpleasant tone, the barista closest to me told me that i need to tell someone else!! let me tell you, it is very rude to treat your customers like this. it's one thing if you are busy and don't have time to "deal with me," but on this particular day there were like 5 people behind the counter and maybe 4 people waiting for their drinks. 10 minutes for tea, no to go cup, hostile barista. ugh. pretty much done with this place. sorry/not sorry.oh and there is another person who works here (mainly register) and she is always talking to people/getting phone numbers/being annoying and holding up the line during busy times. she is the worst because she won't even get your order right unless you are a cute guy with a beard. over it.gave this place two shots: first time i waited 15 mins for my latte. second time i was told it was shops policy to not allow me to take my espresso to go. what? i proceeded to ask the clerk four times for a to go cup and each time he replied with, "no i'm sorry." finally, after offering to pay for the cup, he gave in. i then waited another 15 mins for the espresso to arrive. you gotta be kidding me? it wasn't even that great. i guess there is something to be said for starbucks and caribou.there's a delorean here.  it's not functional but it sure is fashionable.  it wears well w/ all the 80's memorabilia that pervades the entire space.  the space itself is big yet comfortably intimate.  there is ample room for people to get in, get out or stay for a while and get their coffee shop on.the theme here is 80's geek-chic.  there is a goonies poster, a tron poster, that delorean i mentioned in paragraph 1, lunchboxes, and countless star wars models strewn all over the place.  your inner geek child will squeal w/ delight at every detail in this place.  space invader end table?  check.  millennium falcon on the wall?  check.  boba fett in the house?  representin' like a true g, homie.one criticism, however - for a place so heavily entrenched in the 80's, i found it jarring and somewhat annoying that there were no 80's songs on the soundsystem.  when i rolled through, they were playing hits from the 70's.  where's the beef, yo?as mentioned in a previous review, the place isn't ideal for "heads down" studying.  there is just enough activity to warrant a change of location if you're looking for that type of quiet.  however, i did see a lot of people writing furiously on their laptops.  if i'm due for a paper or if i need to kick my writing into another gear, i'll drag my laptop here next time.  it seems perfect for that sort of productivity.overall, it's a really nice coffee shop.  there seemed to be a steady flow of people and the place rammed in around 7:00pm on a monday night so if you're looking to secure yourself a decent study/writing space, get in before 6:45pm.ps:  they need to get a working space invaders arcade cabinet in there.  that'd be so rad!!!i love the 80's theme.  the coffee is great and the danishes are wonderful.  it has wifi and an old nintendo set to try your skills at what your boss played when he was a kid.   it is a destination for all.great coffee but i'm not a fan of the  loud, obnoxious rock music they insist on playing here. don't come here expecting to get any work/studying done.the coffee and service is numero uno awesome. the rich coffee blends give me a warm feeling and cause me to transcend my surroundings. the people who hang out there can only be characterized by "smug alert!" 2nd episode season 10 of south parkthis is going to be a short review as i have really just dipped my toe in the wormhole. i hope to return in the future (or rather, the past) and jump in head first.this was my first stop on my tour de cafe (). all i got was a simple cup of coffee. but it was good, and the people working there were very nice and friendly. there was a cooler with some premade food that looked good, if you're into that sort of thing.the place is comfy and cozy and truly a blast from the past. star wars, ninja turtles, and the pièce de résistance is the delorean in the window. as a ninja turtle might say, radical!i kind of wish i still lived in the neighborhood, for easier access to places like this. gold coasters just don't appreciate indy coffee shops (thus the complete lack of them) but those wicker park hipsters really get them.i'll try to write a more detailed review next time i get back in time to wormhole.wormhole has addicted me to good coffee.and, i was bad last weekend... real bad.friday night, i went to espression by lavazza at ogilvie, because i was craving a coffee drink, and i got this drink with espresso, hazelnut, and some other yummy-sounding things. it was $4, and it was terrible. i threw it out.then, i went to a vendor inside the french market to get some simple metropolis drip $1.50. cold. :-/ damn.sunday, i went to starbucks, craving mocha and it was godawful, $4, i threw half of it out. a little later, i went to new wave, decided they didn't have any coffee i wanted so i got cider, which was good. i also visited kickstand on the same day and got a decent, expensive caffe mocha. i also bought some metropolis beans. mmm.this weekend was a coffee sandwich, because friday and sunday i had mediocre coffee experiences. but saturday was a whole different story.saturday morning, i came here. not a big thing. i love this place. but usually i just get the insanely delicious "peanut butter koopa troopa" (doppio, steamed milk, pb mousse, dark chocolate something-or-other) which is fantastic.but i was feeling like i needed food, and so i got a bowl of reese's puffs. but not any old bowl of reese's puffs. a bowl of reese's puffs with a shot of espresso and chocolate in my milk. heeellll yeeeahhh. and on my way out, i was tempted and treated to (infinite thanks) a "walter the peck" a hot-cold experiment seemingly straight out of alinea. (3 layers, vanilla syrup, ice cold half and half, shot of espresso) you take the shot, let the temperatures mix in your mouth, then swallow... and let me tell you something.... it was eye-opening.this place is a must for coffee-lovers.this is it. this is the place i've been searching for all my life! video games and coffee! great service, great coffee, great people. i will forever be placed at your bar on weekends.for those of us who grew up in the 80s, wormhole provides a heavy, comforting dose of nostalgia and delicious coffee to boot. there is an actual delorean in the shop as well as other random nods to our inner nerd child.love their drinks, and especially their homemade cookies.  hate the service.  i feel i have to wear urban or show my tattoos to be respected at this coffee shop.  $4 for their small signature is steep. thank god their vanilla bean is amazing.    i have always taken my drink to go.  i do not think i could take the critical stares in that atmosphere.this place is awesome! i met a friend there to get some web design work done and it most certainly won't be the last time i go to wormhole.i ordered a specialty drink off the menu, and asked to have it iced, which they happily accommodated....and it was delicious. i also picked up a french macaron from fritz pastry which i was thrilled to find out they had. they also had other nomables from southport grocery. yay!i love that they have metropolis coffee.this place gets insanely crowed, so be aware.and yes, they have a delorean.great little nostalgia cafe, the coffee is great. also try the rocket sauce, very refreshing, but be warned you really need to like the delicious sting of ginger.the owner reached out and it seems the ice coffee issue that princess fussy pants [that's me] was complaining about has been resolved. (thank you for that!) i will give it another try once we all thaw out. in the meantime i've taken to the hot coffee and soy chai and i'm happy.this place is great! it's a pretty chill coffee shop with an awesome back to the future kind of theme with references to the 80s. they play the music at the just the right level to drown out other's conversations but not too loud that i couldn't read my book. i love the vibe and was happy to find that the girls behind the bar were the pretentious hipsters i thought i might run into. the girl who helped me was really nice and patient when i was trying to decide between a pour over or drip brew coffee. i'll be back again!how do i love thee, wormhole? let me count the ways:-the nerdy/trippy vibe-delorean-delicious, no-nonsense coffee-espresso that keeps you up all night-really good tea selection-aranciatas and mexican cokes for when it's too hot for coffee-macaroons! so good.all in all, my favorite coffeeshop in chicago, bar none.the drip is better than most pour overs and i love the beans they serve. it's a lot more quaint and relaxed than variety over on graham.wormhole is definitely my new found favorite places to study.   there's tables, enough outlets, phone chargers, couches, and even an old school nintendo to play if you get bored. the coffee drinks  are definitely not as sweet as your typical starbucks drinks, but that's what i found to be enjoyable about the coffee.  i got the drunken citrus mocha, and it wasn't overpowering in sweetness.  it had the right amount of citrus and mocha flavors, so that it didn't overpower the flavor of the coffee. overall, i loved how everything was so chill.  i will definitely become a regular.great espresso and coffee, great decor, fast service...hell yeah. lots of hipsters but whatever.a great place to sit back and enjoy some great coffee, along with some yummy edibles. the retro feeling and decor adds alot to the experience, as well. i've always enjoyed coming in, but it can get very busy, but that's not uncommon for great spots like this in chicago.they've recently revamped the interior and it helps out alot with the limited space they had before. if you are game to go a little back in time and enjoy some brew, give wormhole a visit.was looking for a hip alternative to and break from my beloved starbucks...and a place to hangout in the city. saw the reviews on yelp and decided to give this a try...my love for the honeybear latte makes me feel like i'm cheating on my husband. only something so warm, comfy, frothy, and welcoming can make me look forward to my next rendezvous. i'm scared to try something else..can't abandon my new bait just yet. i live in the so suburbs so this drive is far...but i like it that way. i'm afraid that if i lived around the corner i would get used to it..but i'm the kind of gal that needs a chase! the atmosphere is so laid back. the staff of young savvys are cool and know their coffee stuff and make some mad drinks..makes me proud of my generation. :) i just wish they were open later so i can just hangout...and hangout...and ... zzzzzzzz.wormhole is without a doubt my favorite coffee shop. yes, it's mostly about the decor, but isn't that what really makes a coffee shop great? the furniture's comfy, and it's the kind of place you can sit and enjoy your drink while having fun, too.don't get me wrong -- the drinks are great. my girlfriend got a dirty iced chai after seeing someone with the same (delicious). i was in the mood for something sweet with my caffeine, and i tried their peanut butter koopa troopa. definitely delicious.but i mean, come on. there's an nes and a delorean. the loyalty card is the konami code. there's star wars trivial pursuit.also, it's a great place to chill during the interminable waits at bongo room next door, should your parents/girlfriend/somebody want to wait an hour and a half before eating pancakes.my favorite coffee shop would have a delorean inside. next time you're in wicker, be sure to stop by and sample one of the specials. think outside of the cup and give anything out of the ordinary a shot. take a break, collapse on a couch, check in on foursquare, and enjoy a quality coffee or tea for a change.among the myriad coffeehouses in wicker park, this is the most young, trendy social spot.  80s paraphernalia including star wars figurines, gremlins and the delorean from back to the future gives wormhole a nostalgic feel.  one can even play pitfall and other old skool games while sipping on gourmet coffee.  don't count on getting a lot of work done at this coffeehouse, however, as seating at the tables is limited and chatting is encouraged.dolorean replica. that's about it. the coffee is okay. the people aren't very friendly. and it's usually crowded. there's only about a bazillion hipster coffee shops in wicker park/bucktown.although there are a dozen or so coffee shops in wicker park, worm hole is the best. the atmosphere is unique and inviting, but if you want to talk about inviting let's talk about the baristas and staff. the staff is always in a good mood, no matter how many tourists are there or how busy it is. they remember their neighbors, by face or even drink. and the coffee is always fresh and delicious. it's also nice to sit outside (when the weather corporates). even though worm hole is a bit outside of my commute, it's worth taking the extra time to stop in for my caffeine fix.coffee is good. atmosphere is fun and relaxing. bakery items were yummy. can't think of any negative to list.  love the 80's decor.  try the ginger & curry latte!!you can't beat the retro/vintage vibe of this place or the fantastic coffee.  it can be a bit crowded at times, but that's always a good sign.behind on yet another deadline, what i really needed was a wormhole.  short of those being proven to, you know, actually exist, the best thing, i figured, was probably a trip to wormhole coffee.  for those who aren't all into theoretical physics (or just watched too many episodes of star trek: the next generation while home dateless), a wormhole is a break in the space-time continuum which can be used for time travel. get it? i know. i know. if you have to explain the joke, it's not funny. anyhow, on with my story of writer's block.  each november, in theory, i try to write 50,000 words as part of national novel writing month.  not surprisingly, with how bad i suck at deadlines despite starting out in college as a journalism major, as the second week of november began, i found myself horribly behind pace.  i figured my only hope of getting back on track was to get thyself to a coffee shop (and quickly go) for the needed inspiration of others tap-tap-tapping away on keyboards!  and this is probably the best tap-tap-tapping place i've found in chicago. now, it's not for the kitsch or the nostalgia. i leave those concepts up to the hipsters who frequent here typing away at art school papers and reading obscure novels (except for the $1.75 flashback cereals, i love those). for me, this place is all about the amenities. sure there are interesting posters of classic 1980s movies and lunch boxes up on the wall. but the plentiful power outlets that run underneath them are what sugars my (yummy, $2.50 for a large mug, peppermint herbal) tea. sure they look a little bit sketchy, like they're from the 1980s themselves or something. but the slight potential excitement of a fire is better than having a dying laptop. and sure there's the obligatory 1980s music playing overhead (mixed of course, since this is wicker park, with indie rock anthems) but, more important to me is the futuristic speed of the free wi-fi. it was so fast, that i was actually able to stream music on rhaspody from the present day while working on a word document and playing on yelp (can you tell why i haven't gotten much noveling done?). in 1987 that would have seemed more mindblowingly high tech than time travelling in a delorean. the crowds seem to know about all of this tubularness, so it's often packed. however, there's enough interesting things to see and do (it's basically a museum) while waiting for seating that it doesn't seem that bad or even a waste of time.i was told they serve metropolitan coffee like new wave, so i checked it out. the coffee is really good, but smaller portion and more expensive than new wave, i think. the large cup seemed to be barely bigger than the size of a starbucks "tall." i get the attraction of the barista's artistic frothy designs on the drinks, but the added labor must make the difference in price. i have been back a couple of times whenever i'm further down on milwaukee away from logan square. the atmosphere is very hipster, which i normally like, but this was a little over the top for me. kinda uptown hipster. on one visit, the counter person was using an ipad to ring up my purchase. the ipad kept freezing or having some problem. stood there for quite a while waiting on the apple device to allow me to pay. i made some smart-aleck remark, "if only you had a cash register, huh." boy, did that get me a nasty stare down. i thought i was being very patient and as clever as i could given the circumstances. finally paid. looked around and noticed the customers sitting down at the tables all had shiny apple macbooks with the glowing apple logo. it looked like a scene of seed pods from the remake of the invasion of the body snatchers. not quite cool enough to be the original, but the decor is definitely 80s enough to be the remake, starring donald sutherland in that awful perm. the quality of coffee, and the opportunity to study mac users in their natural habitat, i will have to give it 4 stars, but barely. it would be 3 without the delorean.often hard to find a seat for more than 1 or 2 people, but a great place to work/study solo.  good level of ambient crowd noise.the music volume is higher than average but isn't very distracting.  if you're like me and lyrical music is super distracting to you, then this is the place.  mostly trancy, subdued 80's music.  because of the ambient noise, silicone earbuds can easily damp out the occasional loud neighbor conversation even without playing your own music.the prices are also good for the area and the servers are friendly enough.and of course, there's an nes in the back and a full sized time traveling delorean which are both pretty cool.internet connection is good too.this place is great. i wish we have more of this in san francisco. i was visiting chicago and just tried to look for a good coffee shop around my area and came to this place. it is very cool. i always like to support small business whenever i can. this place has everything you can ask for for a coffee shop. the staffs are supper friendly, the coffee was fresh and great, the environment is cozy, and the price is exceptionally reasonable. they even have the old nintendo with all the old good games. overall, this is a must go place for coffee if you are in the neighbor.i wanted to update my review since they've reopened with a new layout.  it's much sleeker and cleaner than it used to be and i've finally been able to find seating with each visit! the donut displays are neatly organized, the line is much more orderly, and the service is more attentive.  they get brownie points for playing deerhunter.the honeybear latte blows my mind every-time!ok so the atmosphere of this place is great. i love the toys and posters. great stuff. oh and i was totally feeling the music!!!!! a tribe called quest, mos def and so on. feelin all of it!!!! i was dancing in my seat! other than that i wasn't impressed. my monkey bread was a bit on the old, dry side. meh. i'm guessing it wasn't baked that morning or yesterday morning. my vanilla bean latte tasted nothing like vanilla bean. it tasted like a regular latte. i did however like the little heart on the top of it. lol. this place was packed!!!!! no where to sit!!!! you have to watch for people leaving and jump at the seats before someone else does. i hate that!!!!!! hunting for seats!!!! not cool!!!!! i'll probably come back during the week and it won't be so busy or full.woot! free pastry near close! can't get better than that.oh wait you can.big comfy couches surrounding one of those old school video game consols. legit. big tables for study parties downside: always full, too darklate night coffee and free wifi? yes, please! not only do they have good coffee but they are open late (usually 11pm). i also really like their loose-leaf tea. it has a very cute/hipster atmosphere. friendly people. i also like their cute mismatched mugs. the last time i went, i got a cup of coffee in a superwoman mug.the staff is usually really helpful. good place to meet up with a friend to chat or get some work done in a cool atmosphere.had the peanut butter/mocha this time and it was delicious and super creamy. definitely recommend it. only negative is sometimes it can take a while to get your coffee.was my $2.50 teeny tiny cup of hot chocolate good? heck no, and it was cold. but i'll ignore that because the de lorean in the front window is why we came in, and the free nintendo set up is why we stayed.simply put, this is an awesome place to spend an hour or so soaking in what seems to be a definitively "very wicker park" hang out. everyone is chill, they have free wh stickers you can take, and sell fun pacman-esque t-shirts. which i purchased. even though my hot chocolate sucked. apparently the tea is ok though.are you a nerd?  do you like comics, perhaps?  free wi fi?  couches?  a old school nintendo system?  what about really inventive coffee drinks?  well come all nerds, hipsters, and well...i guess yuppies as well because this little coffee joint is pretty amazing.i have had some really interesting drinks there and while some were not my favorite, i couldn't say i've disliked any of them.  in fact almost all the drinks there have been pretty amazing.  i like the peanut butter troopa a lot.  their latte's are delicious.  oh! and they use metropolis coffee which is amazingly delicious (but not as good as monmouth coffee in london...ahh...london...).it's a great place to chill out with your laptop (as you will see everyone doing in the evenings), hang with friends, relax, maybe even have a date if you don't mind flirting (or not) being shoulder to shoulder with some random person sitting next to you.  also - check out the cool posters in the bathrooms.  calvin and hobbs!!great little cafe in wicker park. they make some impressive drinks, that not only look but taste great. inside there is a decent amount of seating. it's fun to relax here and play some old school video games.i really like their coffee but the service was lacking. i waited 30 min for a latte so it's not really worth the wait!!!great cappuccinos and chai lattes. in fact, i've been making my way around the city testing out chai lattes and this is the best i've found so far. just enough sweetness and a great blend of spices. yum!the employees are very nice and really know there stuff. how can you go wrong with a coffee shop where you can play nintendo?arghhhh!!!if you go through the effort of writing a roast and method of brewing on your chalkboard or whatever, please have it available or erase it.i didn't like what you made me drink.  i wanted the yergacheffe.   plenty of selection in the area, me and mine will go elsewhere.i really wanted to love this place, but came out just liking it. oh well, its still a place i would come to.. so its all good!interior is very retro. staff is so incredibly sweet. their sandwich was mislabeled and i ended up eating meat ( on a day that i was not supposed to, im hindu, so sue me). the girl behind the counter was so sweet when i went to return the sandwich and took all the other ones out of the fridge shelf because they were all mislabeled. after i got my money back, i went back for a delicious lemon scone instead- when the guy was ringing it up, she told him not to and that it was on the house :)  ( because of the sandwich mess up ) yay, i love desserts , even more so when they are free :)the bf and i got a table in the back and we just studying on a long bench with others. the outlet was on the opposite side of the table, but people on the table with us were sweet- offering to guide our messy wires around their coffees, under their mac's and into the outlets. the rest of the shop is very cute- the makeshift delorean in the window, posters, theres a couch where people play old school videogames, the bathroom is super clean ( which is the least i can say about starbucks!) oh yea, all their stuff is natural- so the most processed thing you will find there is splenda. no sugar free shots, nothing that will dirty your body. yum!coffee was good and so was my mocha- but nothing too special. my scone was definitely a 4 star scone. wh (wormhole) has free wifi, which is a major plus! my only problem with this place is the location- its right on milwakee.. so everyone and their mom is here. also, parking on milwakee during the day sucks monkey d@#$. so, we were 5 min late feeding the meter - and were granted a 50$ ticket courtesy of the chicago revenue department! all in all, coffee ended up costing us about 7$, parking about 4$, and ticket 50$. that made this coffee trip quite expensive. im taking the bus next time.sure, hanging out at wormhole feels like finally getting an invite to play contra in the basement rec room of the most popular kid in your 7th grade class. and it doesn't hurt that they have a rotating selection of single-origin espressos and signature beverages. or comfortable furniture, super-fast internets, or piles of cryptic bumper stickers. but the reason wormhole is my favorite shop to hang out at is very simple.they have a frakking sense of humor. you can dress your "bariste" in waistcoasts and suspenders all you like, but you can only dislocate your shoulder so many times patting yourself on the back over your perfect quadruple rosetta tulip crapping a heart latte pour before it starts to mess with your pull. so there it is. it's just coffee, so have some damn fun with it.i always make a stop at the wormhole when i'm visiting nashville.  the quirky atmosphere, friendly staff, and amazing coffee make it a truly unique coffee shop.  my favorite drink i've had from the wormhole is a late with curry & ginger, which was quite outstanding.sometimes when i want to pass the time i need my 1.21 gigawatts, my hyperdrive if you will. my mutagen. my triforce. ok, now that i have all the 80s pop culture references out of my system...one of the reasons i am going to miss being funemployed is places like the wormhole. it's located in wicker park, or as some people call it hipster central. walking into the wormhole that's the first impression you get. dudes in tight jeans, sweater vests, plastic glasses. the place isn't obnoxious. it's actually pretty friendly. the barista greeted me with a smile, and pulled some espresso for my americano, which he served to me in an actual fancy coffee cup, not a mug, not a paper cup. i sat on a sofa, laptop on lap, free wi-fi piped in. and when i say "free" i mean you don't have to type in a code. all you need is the password that they provide. the espresso drinks were good. for me, too much caffeine would have exploded my head.  as another review implied, if you have a short attention span, you will be distracted. i spent thirty minutes staring at a game of super mario brothers that was being played and another twenty reading the 80s pop culture artifacts on the walls and the shelves. it's basically a fun place to hang out, to study, to have a conversation, especially for those who lived at all in the 80s and love good coffee.one of the newer coffee shops on the chicago scene and one of my favorites. they aren't roasting their own coffee and they don't stick to just one coffee companies beans. the folks at wormhole know that there are some great people out in the world roasting some killer coffee and they are here to bring that to you. just like your local craft beer bar serves you fabulous beer from around the world, wormhole is here to do that with coffee. the space is pretty great as well, not only do they have a delorean but they have an old school nintendo for you to play and plenty of seats if you need to pull out that laptop. being open till 11 pm is a huge bonus for me, i'm a big late night coffee fan... heck i'm an all day coffee fan. this place helps me indulge in this addiction in a new way. it's a must vist if you love a good cup of joe.not such diverse menu/choices, also a few of the employees are extremely rude. i had asked for honey and the employee replied "uhh why? that isnt for this drink." hmmm how about im the customer, asked for honey, so why does it matter what drink i ordered? not welcoming at all. drinks are fine, nothing special or out of the ordinary.i wasn't alive for most of the pop culture moments that enshrine this coffee shop, but the magical, nostalgic appeal isn't completely lost on me. that being said, my favorite part of this shop is the ample seating. i never had trouble finding a seat to sip my coffee and do my morning crossword (i may not have come of age in the '80s, but i am still an old lady at heart). in fact, i was there so frequently that my yelp app wouldn't let me check in every time. judging by the tons of people plunking away on their laptops, i'm guessing the wi-fi and outlet situation is tops too.surely a great place to recline, reflect, and savor a great coffee. great hang out place. great service and great people. worth the trip! i highly recommend the homemade vanilla bean coffee!it's been a while since i roamed wicker park. i was never much of a trendster hipster, but i am a coffee house denizen. i was on my way back from downtown chicago and decided to make a stop a visit a friend of mine working at myopic books and figured as long as i was in the area, might as well get some actual work done so i whipped out my droid and its yelp app and started searching for a cafe. wormhole popped up and i started hoofing it on over. walked in and gave an all-knowing internal nod. i knew where i was. i was surrounded by bespeckled hipsters immersed in kant, skinny jean-clad and painfully aware that they were unaware someone might be watching them, so they better look lost in thought. this was my scene 20 years ago, now i felt a little out of place but i grabbed a coffee and muffin nonetheless. now this isn't any sort of damning judgement on wormhole, at no time was i made to feel awkward or unwelcome. quite to the contrary the staff was great and the customers too. the coffee? meh. but the muffin? it was a vegan chocolate pile of awesome and i'd return just get a chance to smell it. delicious. my real complaint is the lack of flat surfaces! i know it's a coffee joint but i reserve my rights as a cantankerous old man so i'd rather they had a few more tables and a few less sofas so i could work more comfortably. but that's a ridiculous complaint so i'll stop right there.wormhole is good, i could totally see myself hanging out there if i lived in the area. as it stands if i'm around wicker park i might stop in for one of them muffins. just need to cram myself into some skinny jeans before i swing by next time.the best coffee shop in wicker park when you want to hang out for a while, get some work done or visit with a friend. the couches add a lot of comfy sitting room, and it's usually not too packed to find a spot. the coffee is good and while not overly friendly, the staff is pretty unpretentious.wormhole does not need more five star reviews.  there is little i can say other than that the coffee is excellent (it is the only place my snooty espresso sipping friends from seattle appreciate in chicago) and the atmosphere and staff are excellent.you know, the lead barrista here has changed my mind about this place.... i can't remember her name... but she's crazy passionate about coffee, guys! she's amazing! basically, she's dedicated her life to learning about coffee and making great coffee. the staff has been much nicer lately, and i really enjoy going here.i have far better feelings about this place, now, and will continue to support them!i suppose i should write a review after logging five consecutive days here, no? if there were some way to charmingly magic-sack this place back to new haven, i'd already have undetectably extended it into my book bag. what a great space!to be honest, i'm really not a coffee fanatic, even after the tiniest of stints as a barista at evanston's best cafe (go brok!!)---i love my tea. that said, my ice coffees have been invariable examples of perfection. and the rocket sauce (a yerba mate-based ambrosia with ginger syrup and lime)...i think my current count is three. the vibe: chill. the people: friendly (meh to the "hipster" haters---whatevs, they're fine). wish i could do all of my reading at the little corner table i've been calling my own.good old espresso coffee machines and a friendly staff make the coffee experience unique. lots of mac-eye-riveted coffee amateurs but very nice atmosphere though. one guy is doing water colors next to me. i didn't have anything to eat but the scones and other treats look delicious.let's talk about beans.  i'm picky about beans.  i grind my own coffee, make my own pour-over at home (well, actually, my amazing tea-drinking husband makes it for me) and drink one perfect cup of coffee per day.  one of my mottos is life is too short to drink crappy coffee.  i also like to shop local.  since i moved to chicago, where there is one independent coffee roaster per city block, i've tried several different roasters.  wormhole sells half wit coffee and so far, it's my favorite in wicker park.  someone at the counter is always willing to explain the flavors in the different beans & roasts to me before i buy.  drinking a cup of their rwanda right now.  yum.  thanks, wormhole, for being walking distance from my house and roasting awesome beans.cool atmosphere. very creative. the coffee was pretty good. it gets crowded so i wouldn't recommend doing some hardcore studying here, but if you want to just read a book, or do some light school work on your laptop, then this is a great place.this place -- this is where it is at!  i think this is the best coffeeshop in the world just because the barista's rock!  they are super nice, really good and the vibe just makes me smile! this is what a coffeeshop should be if you are looking to recreate your youth and have fun with it!  no getting on your high horse here at all!i have nothing bad to say about these people they've done it right from the beginning.i feel like they care more than anybody. best coffee shop vibe, amazing staff. the best coffee. nobody makes it as good as them.everyone knows the trutheveryone knows it is the bestwormhole is now part of my daily life. i recommend it to any human on earth especially those seeking the best coffee possible.the owner treats his employees really nice and he is ripped, young, and rich and sometimes works there in the morning.everyone else who works there are true characters and they are all the best at what they do.side note: when my friend got killed by a drunk driver they came to me and offered to take care of beverages and food for a memorial which is very kind from a small business. they just came out of nowhere. they are definitely a great caring place, they care about their customers and their job.bonus, lots of vegan options. owner owns the roasting company as well.and the person who roasts coffee for the wormhole is all about coffee. coffee genius. you have to try this placehad the peanut butter hot drink -- can't remember what it is called.  but it was scrumptious.  for these reasons: 1- it was peanut butter for god's sake! 2- it was not overly sweet, but rather rich, frothy and peanutty goodness 3 - it was beautifully decorated with a lovely hand-crafted swirl.  i am not sure what their drip coffee was like.  they have metropolis beans, i believe.  they also appeared to offer a "guest roaster" bean for sale.  they did have a few types of frisbee-sized cookies for sale (one with pretzels!), but i actually declined, such a rarity.  my friends had the real vanilla bean latte and they said it was absolutely fabulous.such a cool throwback vibe. love the old-school video games and movie posters. coffee and espresso drinks were excellent. seating was really homey and great for hanging out to do work or chatting with friends.if i could give the wormhole even more stars, you bet your sweet ass that i would because this place is fantastic. i don't live in chicago, but every time i'm within city limits i made a bee line here because the coffee is delicious, the bakery items are always fresh and delectable, and the service is even better. i am always greeted kindly by the knowledgeable and personable staff.i work as a barista with a dream to one day own my own shop, and if it turned out to be anything like the wormhole, i'd be insanely happy. keep it up, boys and girls. you're fantastic.just an fyithe staff is exceptionally nice, professional, and considerate. its a pleasure giving these guys regular tips and kudos. this is impressive considering how late their open. i would be really crabby. i think they should consider a 24 hour lockdown or party for charity. i bet you could get this place pretty packed.it's annoyingly funny when a stereotype perpetuates itself. this is the quintessential artificially created hipster coffee shop, filled with ironic posters, soul-less kitsch and tattooed barristers with little customer service chops. the ambiance is made of props that someone thinks is supposed to go into an urban, artsy cafe. the main vibe here is trying too hard to be cool & that especially doesn't fly when you have "alternative" baristas who get pissy if you break their rules. i'd forgive the uncomfortable stools and silly decor if the service was better and the drinks were delicious. the banister didn't serve my tea in the cup size i requested, my friend's americano took a long time & when we asked about it, barrister guy snapped that they only make one drink at at time, but they took so long that his drink was cold, it was remade with attitude (& they almost made it wrong - we had to correct her), i was told i couldn't get a hot water refill unless i showed them the tea bag i bought from them & this, after a spanish inquiry about what the hot water was for & did i buy that cup there. my friend's americano was way too bitter & needed more hot water to mellow it out. too bad about worm hole. i'll stick to filter where the counter service is way nicer and where they don't try too hard to be a formula hipster place.the sky above wicker park was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.  ratz was working at the espresso machine, his prosthetic arm jerking monotonously as he filled a glass with coffee and steamed milk.  "it's not like i'm using", i heard someone say, as i shouldered my way through the crowd at the door of the wormhole.  "it's like my body's developed this massive caffeine deficiency." ... a chunk of memory dislodges itself ...finally a coffee house in wicker park that a) isn't a scene, and b) offers a reasonable chance of finding a seat most any time.  i'll cop, to be sure, to an indifference-tinged befuddlement over this place and its patrons' obsession with those aspects of the 80s that sucked the most.  first as tragedy, then as farce, i guess.... all the coffee he drank, all the bikes he'd ridden and the corners he'd cut in the neon wilderness, and still he'd see the bradbury building in his sleep ...it's harmlessly instructive, i suppose, of the risks of nostalgia.  if not also - pace the delorean in the window - a nice mise en abyme of the 80s' own painfully extended exercise in the evacuation of history from daily life.... bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless void ...honestly, this place had me once i saw the delorean in the window.the 80's theme is done so tastefully, the place feels very homey and comfortable. there are lots of different seating options with tables or couches. the decor is a nice distraction every once in a while. plus the wifi is unlimited which in my book is always a plus.i had their dragon green tea which was served in a wonderful bodum glass (nice touch) and the leaves were measured out with precision. lovely cup of tea.i'm spending my entire day here, love it.this place is sooo overrated!  went in there for a cup of coffee and it was like frickin hipster black friday.  there must have been 6-7 people behind the counter.  i ordered my coffee to go and waited there 10 minutes.  out of the many employees working behind the counter  only one of them was working.  yeah the place is decorated with 80's gear but maybe they should of spent some of that money on training their employees on how to make a cup of coffee!  stupidest place ever.  husband and i are boycotting it for being so lame.  over priced, too!  blah!this is both a cool and a cozy coffeeshop. i like it for these reasons: the coffee is good. there is free wi-fi. there is an enormous replica of the dolorian from back ii the future near the door, a working nintendo with games, and abundant nerd-chick early 90s memorabilia. there are big comfortable chairs and couches as well as one of those long thin tables with outlets for laptops at regular intervals. the reasons i don't come here more often are: i need to be able to study, and it's very dimly lit. the laid-back vibe and bad lighting are more conducive to a nap or a chat than to doing work.  this place is also often so crowded that i have trouble finding a seat at all, much less a seat near an outlet for my computer. i'm agnostic about the food situation, since i come here to drink caffeinated potables and not to buy lunch. however, i don't think they have much food aside from pastries (which i haven't tried, but they do look tasty) and sandwiches which are pre-made and in a refrigerator near the registers.i would probably frequent this place more often if i lived nearby--but i also don't go out of my way to come here. it's solidly good, solidly busy, and has a great interior and atmosphere for a casual afternoon coffee with a friend.very unique coffee shop. glad i yelped and found it. star wars posters in spanish, stuffed yoda and an arcade scoreboard listing the menu adorn the walls. we had the cosby classic and peanut butter mocha both of which were quite good. the real surprise was the donut with cream filling which although it sounds like an average thing, was extremely delicious. very hipsterish atmosphere.super nice owner contacted me, which i appreciate. and for that, a few more stars are added to my review. i used to like this place when it was nicer. i've been here several times before today and everything has been fine. today, when i took my son in to trick or treat, i was told by one of the co-owners or perhaps a barista, that they didn't have candy. i reminded her that it was halloween. she said that if i asked nicely, then maybe, they would give me a cookie. huh? are you serious? snarky and cheap? everybody on milwaukee ave. with the exception of 7-11 gives kids candy on halloween. it's all a part of the community. all of these good reviews must've gone to their head.  i will never go here again. i'll give my business to filter.so...when i can actually accomplish a night of homework in an environment of star wars toys, 1980's posters, smurfs, e.t., wondrous music, a delorean car, free wi-fi, pu-reh tea, coffee, tons of seating and outlets...so many electrical outlets!!!, you know, i found a win. after dinner at ear wax, my husband and i headed to wormhole on a whim and relaxed. a hell of a place. an inspiration for a someday cafe owner. great service, but gets crowded quickly. save me a seat!get the harrison gourd. it is about as good as a double espresso shot gets. sweet potato cream and lemon zest  top off this sophisticated seasonal treat.delorean- check!nintendo games- check!awesome coffee- check!yummy croissants- check!star wars stuff everywhere- check!this place has the perfect combination for the best coffee shop ever. i drank coffee, ate a croissant, and played bubble bobble for half and hour. i was in heaven. a must visit!hey, wormhole is cool.i think in what they set out to do-- make the place an eighties nostalgia and sci-fi geek's wet dream-- they more than succeeded. the music is ambient, not club-like so a+ for general environment and atmosphere.  and to the other reviewers on here-- ok, the delorean is cool. but seriously, we know. honestly i got over it like the third time i went. you're judging a cafe on what kind of discontinued vehicle it has in its storefront... seriously?i want to like woho but for someone like me who needs a cafe to haunt (i can't get work done at home) this place is hugely frustrating. first of all, there's barely ever a place to sit so i have to leave before i even order. this cafe is famous to a fault (probably thanks to you know what). assuming you don't get a seat at the one main table, you have to compete with hipster social hour on the couches or super mario bros. again, this would be awesome if i didn't have things to get done.  i realize i'm one of these deplorable laptop geeks that plague cafes, but can i please be one in peace-- there are others like me.the coffee is perfunctory. more often than not it's scorched or not even poured fresh. i like soy lattes and i know they're harder to make but the crema sometimes is just destroyed.they also don't have any microlot coffees (i'm not subtracting a star for this though as i realize most cafes don't!) their single-origins are eh. the baristas are nice, but not always knowledgeable or above and beyond if you know what i mean. i went a day after halloween and they were all busy complaining in a side conversation with another customer about a woman who had given them two stars on yelp... i kid you not.   alas, wormhole i love you but you're bringing me down.i'm looking forward to caffe streets opening as it's both closer to where i live and presumably a more comfortable workspace. i've heard mike phillips is helping open it too!every drink i've tried i love! this is a fun coffee shop with a fun atmosphere. the honey bear late is to die for. great place to work or hang out with friends. it can get a bit noisy...but get over it-- it is a sacrifice you can make for delicious coffee!went to try the #1 coffeehouse on foursquare. and of course, to check out the delorean (and saw a kid playing video games on an 80s console). i don't usually drink lattes but...best vanilla bean latte i have ever had (eric, you rock)! don't take this the wrong way, but.. i wanted to stick my head in the cup and lick the remaining foam. so i poured more coffee in it and finished that up. croissant was buttery and flaky. pure heaven.there are a ton of places to get coffee in in wicker park, but very few seem to really "get it."  wormhole is one of those talented few, and one of my favorite joints not only in the 'hood, but in the entire city of chicago.  great coffee, awesome staff, and fun environment.delicious (and local) metropolis coffee is always on tap, but the fact that there's also a rotating guest espresso keeps the regulars coming back for more.  most places stock coffee from a single roaster, and leave it at that.  i've gotten to try a number of really interesting coffees that would otherwise be inaccessible, and i commend wormhole for that.in terms of the staff, wormhole also gets five stars.  with several veteran baristas on hand, you know you'll always get a delicious, perfectly crafted drink.  but not only are they skilled, but friendly as hell.  i've been to numerous other cafes in the city where the staff is apathetic and/or dismissive, but the owner of this establishment clearly puts tremendous emphasis on good service.  that's really the lifeblood of any successful business, after all.last but not least, they've got a motherfxxking delorean in the window.  check this place out!i found the wormhole when i was in chicago in december, and visited on friday again last week.  it has the best decor of any coffee shop i have been in if you are into 80's culture, and i felt like it was a good crowd.  it was younger, but not pretentious at all even though it's in a hip neighborhood which some people who don't normally go to coffee shops fear.  the barista was friendly, and we chatted briefly about halfwit coffee which they serve, and i have purchased and had shipped to austin in the past.  i was with my younger brother who doesn't like going to coffee shops because of the hipster scene which is sometimes a valid concern, and he loved it.  i was disappointed though that he order the cold brew on nitro that i talked up, and it came out as an iced coffee without an explanation.  i'm one of those quiet customers who unless you have completely messed up will usually not correct people, especially when it's busy which it was at the tail end of the morning commute.  we still enjoyed it, and hopefully his wife drags him back to get his proper cold brew on nitro.  it was a pretty solid experience, and great coffee shop overall.as part of my city wide tour of chicago's old and new coffee roasters, i thought i'd update my review now that the wormhole roasts their own beans.. i highly recommend the half wit ethiopian gelana abaya. it starts off balanced with a tiny bit of milk chocolate and gets juicier as it cools. the barista described it to me as shortbread and strawberries, and while it hinted at strawberries on its finish, i respectfully disagree re: shortbread. regardless, it's delightful. i'd buy a bag of it for sure.over on the other side of the drink menu, i believe that their vanilla latte is the best in the city (possibly the best i've ever tried).great prices, dedicated staff and a wonderful selection of products. i just wish i could  just find a seat once in awhile!the decor was cool, coffee was good, and you can play nintendo video games. i absolutely love this place. they have a lot of different drinks here too and definitely worth to try. the wormhole coffee is definitely a plus in wicker park.glad to find my way into this wonderful little coffee house on an extraordinarily freezing cold day recently. the tea selection is really great. one of the baristas is not shy about letting you know what she thinks about the various teas. the atmosphere is pleasant and non-stressed, unlike starbucks that often feels like a coffee pick up place with loud, sassy music. i think it's a good way to get rid of people. wormhole has none of that. the music was great ... an urban background that allowed for conversation of its patrons. imagine that! plenty of space to spread out with comfy couches and some tables. they even make use of the front window as a seating area.i took a star off because despite my friend finding and handing me a drink card, the cashier did not even bother to punch the two "dranks" on the card. that's pretty shitty. i've noticed that of late; vendors offering all kinds of freebies, and then not following through. a little shocking, given the state of the economy. it's a shame, flaky and just downright rude. don't offer what you don't and never intended to give. it's tasteless and classless.the coffee and service is great here.everything a coffee shop should be. it is jam packed throughout the day, but that shows that they know what they are doing with their coffee. they are serious about it, and it is good.wow. honestly the best coffee i've had. the atmosphere is great as well. if you're in chicago and you love coffee, you must go here."the force will not be with us on monday, september 20" reads the sign on the door.  aka, the wormhole would be closed.  children of the 80s, rejoice!  "whoa, this is heavy." - marty mcfly/ dana f.in the window: a delorean.  mechanically, it's no porsche, but pretty damn awesome.  there are alf posters, top gun posters, calvin and hobbes comic books, vintage tin lunchboxes (did anyone else spot the yelp elite lunchbox?!), an atari, and one of those shelves where you kept all of your cassettes (grandfather of the cd rack).  coffee is served in darth vader mugs.  i was awestruck for a minute there - so much so that the barista asked if i was okay.  i wasn't okay, i was giddy and elated!but to get to the heart of the matter: the coffee.  what good is the kitsch, nostalgic atmosphere if the coffee is terrible?  my espresso was fantastic.  full bodied, slightly sweet, smooth, and of the perfect viscosity.  paired with a little nilla wafer, wormhole's espresso is a great way to get that much-needed caffeine boost and do a little bit of work or reading.everything about this place is done so right. the chai is always on point, the atmosphere is inviting and super laid back, and the seating is perfectly done so you can hang out on the couches with pals or sit and study at a table. definitely an all time favorite.love this place!! mostly everything in wicker park is guaranteed to be amazing, but i just have to say how great this place is anyway!! good, local coffee and friendly workers. they have huge macarons too!this place is extremely over rated, just as many things in wicker park usually are. the staff is very helpful , technology savvy, and informed about whatever product or concoction they are serving; however, the prices for a drink here....are out of this roof. seriously, a small tea with lime and ginger extract....5.50. wtf? i can make that at home, or at least 9 of these, for under 2 dollars at home. this place was clean and quiet  , and i think they even offered free wifi...but i'd be a traitor, order a drink somewhere else  , and bring it in here for the ambiance. there is so much light, you're bound to stay awake. also, like i said before the staff was kind and courteous , and willing to offer advice and information on flavors and recipes, but they were also fast paced. that is the only reason i am giving this place a 2, because sadly, the prices, the flavors, and the small list of available choices make it a place i don't need to return to. it's just "meh"i came up to the counter yesterday obviously lost and confused and the baristas set me straight. and they led me on a path to these amazing coffee shots which you must go and experience. i had the tall one (there's also a shorter, ball looking shot glass), and i guess the names change. there's a bottom layer of vanilla bean syrup (i think they said its homemade?!), next cold half and half, and finally on top 2 hot espresso shots. slowly pour the whole thing in your mouth, and finally swallow. mmmmmmmmmmm sooo good and weird.so yes guess the coffee shots. and i won't hold it against the wormhole for my parking ticket.oh and lastly, lots of people write about the wormhole in the missed connections section on craigslist, so i think the wormhole's customers need to man up and start talking to that cute guy/girl that is sitting over there.i loved the decor, i loved the atmosphere, and i loved the cool drinks this place served. however, needless to say, wormhole is always packed. it's a bit hard to find a spot to sit comfortably near an outlet, but if you don't mind sitting right in the middle of people, you'll be fine. sometimes when i just read, i'm okay with little space, but when i'm really studying, i prefer to study without having my elbows knocked. their coffees are interesting, and rocket juice makes summer heat bearable (although summer's almost gone now). i wish i lived closer so i could visit whenever i had to study :tthis place is freaking sweet! i had the bobachino. it comes in a mug that looks like boba fett's helmet. it was a 4 shot soy cappuccino. soy foam is hard to make creamy if you're not good. these guys were good! the french macaroons were like omg. i had a chai and a lemon. i want one now. too bad i can't use the force...speaking of the force the ambiance was awesome. i made friends with the patrons.  and they serve cereal. i wish i could live there.let me start by saying that i have a nostalgic soft spot for 1980s pop culture. as someone raised on movies like gremlins, ghostbusters, and the goonies, entering the wormhole was an amazing experience for me. while it has already been said 100 times on here, a full-size delorean in the front window is hard to beat. how about the christmas gizmo doll on the wall? nostalgia aside, the baristas at wormhole brew a mean espresso. mine was perfect...not too bitter, but not diluted either. i also enjoyed a skim mocha, which had a nice balance between the chocolate and espresso. as for the seating area, there is kind of a weird layout. you have some long tables at the back of the store with hard chairs. then, you have a couple of couches and soft chairs right in front of the long tables. from there, you have a large, wide-open space. finally, there is one small table w/ a couple of chairs in the front corner of the store. i kinda like the layout, though i was fortunate enough to get that small table by the front window. had i been forced to sit at one of the long tables in the back, my experience might have been different. with that in mind, while the quality of coffee at wormhole is equal to intelligentsia, i prefer wormhole because of the aforementioned "blast from the past" atmosphere that it provides. the one complaint i have (and this has nothing to do with wormhole) is that the wicker park area only has a few nice blocks of shops and bars. while wormhole is located in the shopping stretch area of milwaukee ave., once you hit milwaukee and division, the area starts becoming sketch. that being said, if you stay within those few blocks along milwaukee, damen, and north, you should be fine.i'm a nerd. i love video games, i love ghostbusters, i love back to the future... the list goes on. wormhole seems like it was invented for me. obviously, as other reviewers have pointed out, the delorean in the window is just awesome. but everything else is awesome too, from the posters to the collectible figurines speckled about the cafe.wormhole serves the highest-quality lattes i have had in chicago. period. filter, alliance, intelligencia, starbucks, einstein bagels, goddess and grocer - anywhere you go, you can't get a latte better done than this. even more shockingly, every latte on the menu is high-quality (i have sampled them all).now, the drinks are pretty expensive. a "small" is 8oz, and a "large" is 12oz - the same size as a tall drink at starbucks. and you'll pay $4.00-4.25 for that "large" drink. but again, the quality matters - and i have (somewhat begrudgingly) gone back again and again to drink the high-quality beverages there. so yes, it's pricey, but it's worth it, so i can't dock it any points just because i don't have the kind of income needed to spend $4 every time i get a drink.i love the atmosphere, and with only two windows, it's a pretty dark interior, especially compared to filter, the other neighborhood "i'm going to sit here on my laptop and study or write a paper for the next 6 hours." if you're looking for a ton of coffee and food and windows to wake you up, then go to filter. if you want to go somewhere dark and cozy, with decor that will certainly delight if not distract, then go to wormhole.great atmosphere, and unbelievably good coffee. everything i tried was perfect.as a visitor to chicago, i loved the vibe of wicker park. when my friends recommended we stop by the wormhole, i couldn't help but give a chuckle of delight. i ended up getting the honey bear latte that day. during my visit, i came back in three more times to enjoy that honey bear latte iced. i walked through sunshine and rain. i loved this place that much. it isn't just the nostalgic '80s get-up they have that draws you in. every single barista was down-to-earth and generous. whether it's small-talk or advice about coffee, you're going to find someone knowledgeable and hospitable. if you're a regular, do ask for a punch card. it comes on a paper nintendo controller :)this place definitely has a soft-spot in my heart. ch-ch-check it out!decor is on point.  delorean dmc-12 time machine from back to the future? yasssssssssssss. macarons. they have 'em. (not great, but whateva..)pretty healthy/good selection of food. i'd eat here. next time. open till midnight on weekdays?! yay :)i'll be bock.despite the throwback theme that might detract from the ever-present and glorious smell of a brilliant cup of coffee, this is by far my favorite coffee shop in chicago. this is perhaps my favorite coffee shop in all the land.actually, the decor is quite nice. a product of the 80's (and i'm not bragging, simply noting why all of the posters, old school nintendo sets and themes strewn about appeal to me) i can appreciate the variations on a theme.delorian, dimly lit tables to cozy into near the back and well lit window seats and tables in front really make for the perfect interior. a little "something for everyone."the coffee is also extremely tasty. smooth and never bitter and there are combinations i'd never have opted for had i not been to wormhole (a peanut butter koopa troopa?!).the staff is pleasantly aloof. this sometimes annoys me and i feel as though a genuine smile works the best. service is a bit hit or miss for me. some days i receive that genuine smile and others i get rushed through my order and barely dealt with. the ice queen(or king) act at independent coffee shops must be written in their memo-books someplace.it's getting old but hell, your coffee is delicious so perhaps you know folks will be back in no matter the demeanor.i'm a steady patron, that's for certain.overall, this place is tops. i'd gladly walk some miles or jump a bus line or two to get here...even during a blizzardafter a message from the manager about my previous review, i was actually kind of reluctant to go back. i don't like to be "yelped" at for relaying honest comments about a place, even if they have only been open for a few weeks. i expect every place i spend money to have their stuff together, no matter how long they have been open.thankfully, wormhole does seem to be getting the reigns on their shop.  the baristas and counter people seem on their game and the coffee is still just as delicious as before. maybe even more delicious. they have this 3 dollar bowl of cocoa puffs with a shot of espresso in it that is f-ing amazing. so good. also, they have so many outlets. so many! i was flabbergasted and excited. at filter i always feel like i am playing "hunt for an outlet" but not at wormhole. i can tell this place will be around for a long time, even if the milk station is still too cluttered for me, because the coffee is great and the service gets better every day.i don't drink coffee, so i can't comment on anything related to that. i had fruity herbal tea that was delicious and came in this cool mug that i am totally coveting. they could use more food and sweets selection.the atmosphere brought back memories of my favorite childhood movies. the vibe is laid back and mellow. the best part is that it's open until at least midnight. i'm a night owl, so i'm always looking for a place that's open past 10.me likes.ooh! on a personal note, this is my 100th review! :)i almost always give coffeehouses four stars, but i think this one is gonna be pretty accurate.our bearded friend/barista was pretty helpful in finding a medium (literally) for my light roast versus my company's dark roast preferences. their coffee de-jour tends to have a different brewing method for each, and the one we got, if i remember correctly, was nicaraguan brewed in a chemex (which he attempted to explain until he realized we understood how it worked). that always shows that your barista is a knowledgable barista. then he told us that if we both wanted the same thing, he'd just basically make one big brew and split the coffee between us. i think that means he brewed a 16oz. it was four bucks for the two of us. an honest barista is a friendly barista.so, was the coffee any good, you ask? sure-- if you like acidic coffee. if you know your coffee and know your coffee regions, i guess you already knew that about nicaragua beans, but i didn't. it starts off acidic and kind of lingers until you finish the sip off. granted this process lasts about five seconds, but still.my gentlemanfriend called this joint "pretentious," with a little grin and short laugh, whatever that could possible mean. i guess you should just read that like you would read your pretentious book at wh.nerd factor: 3e^pi. the only reason i set foot in this place was due to the delorean. hell i hate coffee, but i'd go again just to go hang out next to the adam console and shuttle tiderium models.great new coffee shop celebrating everything from my childhood.. i came there yesterday for the first time and it was great- nostalgic movie/tv show themed decorations, enjoyable music, free no-strings-attached wifi, and i had a positive experience with the baristas. of course, it is a coffee shop, so its time to talk about my peanut butter blaster mocha(or something like that). it was truly delicious- i kind of expected it to taste sugary sweet and over the top, but what i got was so much better than that. the chocolate taste was rich and smooth and it had a deep aroma of peanuts rather than a dessert-like drink. for those of you who don't normally do sweet drinks, give this a try and you might very well be surprised. also, i got a free chocolate muffin from their "day old" basket. so tasty, and such an awesome little perk!wormhole, i'll be back, and i'll be bringing my friends with me.there are a lot of super rad things about this place. there's the obvious -- an actual delorian and insanely awesome '80s memorabilia. and the not as immediately obvious -- the most delicious vanilla latte i've ever tasted. love it.now, name that '80s movie...dark helmet: what's the matter with this thing, what's all that churning and bubbling? you call that radar screen? colonel sandurz: no, sir. we call it ... mr. coffee. care for some? dark helmet: yes. i always have my coffee when i watch radar, you know that.coffee, back to the future delorean, mac classic in back, powerbook 170 in front of the baristas, free stickers & the mocha puffs.nice place, free wifi, no attitude, decent prices & '80's kitsch. yay!cool joint, didn't get coffee here, but prior to eating at a restaurant nearby, got to check out their coffee shop. i got the cookie, which was okay~ really sweet, but abit hard. i like my cookie warm and chewy~ :/this is a sweet spot for several reasons: nintendo, vegan pastries, really good beverages (i had thyme warp and damn was it refreshing).  it's crowded all the f-ing time though. does anyone work or is everyone now remote comp geek hipsters?  i just want my nintendo time...i know they rearranged ages ago to have more space. maybe a further expansion :)i came here once and with three cups of coffee finished a book and took a mini nap. the wormhole is really great, sometimes the music makes it difficult to concentrate, but i'm sure that just depends on the employee. go here!great coffee and chill envirnonment. slightly "too cool for school" baristas and sales people but that is to be expected in this type of place. as far as coffee places to hang nearby, this place is the tops!why does a non-coffee drinker hang out so much in coffeeshops? (trust me, you do not want to see me after half a cup of coffee.) the ambiance, the wifi, the comfortable seating, the snacks, the occasional friends i run into... they're better places to hang out and get things done than my living room.this place has high scores on most of my coffeeshop criteria. lots of comfy cushy chairs for my bony ass? check. fun look to the place? i like the eighties theme stuff, but the color theme is a dark bluish grey... not energizing (though it's well executed.) also it was a little showroom-y, things matched a little too well. give it a 4 out of five. snack/drink selection? i got there at the end of the day, so it seemed a little thin, but you know, being a night owl, i'll probably be there at the end of the day in general. but my banana nut muffin was quite good. the chai latte was also good, if small. again, four out of five? free wifi? why would i hang out at a place without wifi? i didn't notice any slowdowns. check.late hours? open till midnight--sweet! check.other friends hanging out there? first time i visit, there's a bunch of my friends from pumping station: one to geek out with. check.so-- the debate is: do i give it a 4 or a 5? hard call. if i was a coffee drinker, i'd definitely go 5. but the weak snack selection didn't do it for me (hint: something substantial and chocolatey at the point-of-sale display and i'm yours.) and the showroom ambiance did not seem creatively stimulating. i'd go here to test code, maybe, but not to brainstorm new ideas.i wanted to love this place. i'm not in love, but i like it a lot. i'll definitely be back. and i'm definitely rooting for its success.wow, it's been 2 years since my last review and i'm still in love.  a lot of the original staff seems to still be there slingin' the best cups of joe in the city.  i walk in and feel at home every time... these folks are either really good at marketing or are extremely passionate about their craft; i say absolutely both!  ever since they began roasting their own beans, halfwit coffee roasters, i've become even more hooked.  as long as these doors are open, i see no reason to move out of wickie p.  keep it realz, and i will forever be a faithful customer of your wormholiness!wormhole, an unstable universe existing in space...and milwaukee ave along cta blue line. take off at damen station, there is a sick coffee shop specializing halfwit roasters in this neighborhood. lots movies' roles, posts and even stage props are full of this amazing place. i couldn't take my eyes off the decor and just enjoyed my espresso drinks. it has beaten intelligentsia down and became my top 1 coffee shop in chicago by its theme decor and smoothly rich taste.oh snap!mikey, data, chunk and mouth represent!plus...a delorean and darth vaders and yodas you read that right....i'm talking about a life size delorean in the coffee shop plus tons of 80's decor.all of the above is just icing on the cake for their coffee.their pour over coffee is how it should be everywhere... excellent!!!it's a hipster sort of place but us non hipsters did not feel out of place.go for the nostalgia and stay for the coffee... you wont regret it!all time favorite coffee!!! but it's a busy spot so don't go if you're in a hurry and to sit and concentrate. ;)best coffee in the city and coolest shop as well. don't expect to find many seats as there are laptops and cords everywhere. this isn't a shop to go to if you're in a rush either as the waits can be pretty long.where to start?! the good things: -of course a coffee shop in wicker park is hipster central, which equals fun people watching. -the delorean in the front and all the other 80s throwbacks-decent coffee.anyway, when i go to a coffee shop, i usually want to get some work done and not be distracted by chores/tv/phone calls at home. so i went to the wormhole with tasks to accomplishment. my issues:-the wormhole is not a hipster study haven. it's a hipster social spot.-the wifi was not secure and too slow for me to get my work done.-it was super crowded (the same problem of any trendy coffee shop in chicago)-i need to get a mac book apparently... there was no pc love hereall of these things (minus my love for my pc) meant i got very little work done. likely won't be back... but i see why others like it.this is geek paradise.  vintage movie posters and toys (including a lot of star wars and he-man toys my brothers had when we were kids.) half and half marked ".5 n .5" - coco puffs in espresso and milk (seriously!) and a big stinkin' replica of the time machine from back to the future.i love this place.even if their drip coffee tastes mildly of cabbage.(though their vanilla bean lattes are delicious.)fun little coffeeshop that lets you play videogames while you sip, gulp, or eat! my personal favorite is their homemade vanilla bean, on the rocks. :)i am only an occasional coffee drinker, and i don't know how/refuse to learn to make a pot of coffee for 1 at my apartment, so this is my place to go when i need a fix. coffee is delicious, quick, and the lattes always have a cheerful design (that i ruin when i mix sugar in). my only suggestion is to add skim milk to the sugar/milk/cream table area. and even if you don't, i'll still come back.a mean cappuccino and vegan scone. clean fresh up-to-date fun hip space.over rated, hipster dump. the customer service is no where near friendly. they should just get in the stupid "back to the future car" and go back to a time where maybe they could learn some customer service. nothing cool about this place at all. i would have been better off at starbucks.  i had to give a star because i had to give a star.great coffee. the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because this coffee shop is always packed.great coffee, but no room to sit and enjoy it. too many people with computers taking up room.i had a delicious iced double espresso here during the july '11 chicago heatwave.  (such refreshing relief.)we found this coffee shop randomly, walking down the street when we noticed the delorean from back to the future in the display window.  it truly is a "wormhole"  to the 1980s entering this place.  we hung out for about 30 minutes on the couch, playing mike tyson's punch out on the nintendo.   awesome place and awesome coffee.loved this place- the staff here is fantastic! the barista taking my order was so honest with his suggestions that it was comical. i told him it was my first time there and asked him what was good to order. he let me know that everything was good and that it would be in my best interest to order one of everything on the menu. we chatted a little bit more about my flavor preferences and he was able he suggested that i try the honey bear latte. something with great flavor that wasn't too sweet. the honey bear latte offered a delicious union of bitter espresso and sweet honey. it was perfect for me. the barista was super friendly and easy to joke around with. he even gave me a card to come back for a "free drank" so that i wouldn't have a choice but to come back again. which is fine by me! i would have come back even without it! my friend had one of their signature vanilla lattes that he thought was good but we both agreed that my latte was better. we sat at the bar area near the service station and ended up having great conversations with most of the staff there about which restaurants in the area they thought were good. everyone was so kind and friendly. i'll definitely be returning for my free drank.this place is great. you can get a great cup of coffee or a special drink which is prepared by excellently trained and passionate baristas. the counter staff was very eager to teach me and my roommates about the special drip to order coffee which was a very pure flavor. the delorean was awesome and the ambiance was great. definitely going back here.i'm a casual coffee drinker, but i've spent a lot of time around coffee in general. usually one of the first things that puts me off of a new shop (aside from bad drinks of course) is the space itself. with delorians, star wars toys, he-man toys, and other awesome 70's/80's decor it's hard not to love the shop. it's also got a lot more space to move around and doesn't feel closed in and cramped like a lot of shops these days.it's refreshing for the decor to not feature a vintage/thrift store style setting as that whole thing is getting a bit stale.the staff is super nice and professional and they definitely know their drinks. the vanilla iced latte made for me (by the super cute barista) was fantastic!if this place is as awesome as it is in the first week of opening i can't wait to see how things turn out when they get everything in proper order. do yourselves a favor and give this place a good shot.wicker park needed you wormhole, best of luck!see you this week...a very cute, kitschy coffee house that is cozy and friendly. if you want to ditch the starbucks and come to a friendly neighborhood spot, look no further. everyone there was super nice, the coffee was reasonably priced and tasty, and the decorations were really cool and will give you something to look at for hours! if i'm ever in the area, i'll definitely come back here!what can i say? the peanut butter koopa troopa is to die for! the ambiance is amazing, and makes for the perfect place to read a good book. best coffee you will ever have in yo lyfe!you can get a bowl of cookie crisps for less than the price of a coffee. brilliant.they've got a delorean in the front window. that's all there is to know. oh, and deliciously strong iced coffee.good coffee, but a pretty douchey guy was pouring drinks when i went in. cool atmosphere though with the old 8 bit nintendo you can play in the back and a full size replica of the back to the future delorian time machine on display.best baristas in chicago, amazing precision and great coffee.  funky place and music too.shopping the myriad of vintage stores in wicker and uke can be exhausting, especially with a hip, stylish teenager in tow.  so what better way to refuel than at a coffeeshop that pays tribute to the the 80s?  ok, so cool decor aside, what really matters here is whether the coffee is any good.  and while the prices are a tad higher than your usual barista joint, these ladies seem to be true artisans of the craft. we ordered two of their specialty lattes -- the drunken citrus mocha and the peanut butter koopa troopa.  carefully brewed and blended and served just hot enough for immediate enjoyment.  and well worth the nearly $5 a cup!  both were sweet without being overdone, yet with strains of syrup flavor between the roasty flavor of the coffee.  simply put, these were two perfectly amazing concoctions.while i doubt i could afford to do this often, both for financial and nutritional reasons, i was impressed enough by their technique and willingness to push the envelope that i'd make a point to come back here again next time i am in the neighborhood.  these folks are doing things with coffee and flavorings that i have not seen attempted elsewhere.  so if you enjoy coffee and all of the delectable treats can result from blending it with creams and sugars, you owe it to yourself to take a dive into the wormhole.  good stuff done right!definitely a cute place, but i find the 80s theme a bit puzzling. don't get me wrong, i'm all up for hanging top gun movie posters in italian, scattering atari games everywhere, and (of course) parking a delorean in the front window. it's just that the average customer age here is probably around 22, and we didn't really grow up with that stuff... so i'm not really sure what to make of it. imagine, a decade from now, people who are 12 now hanging out at a coffee shop with posters for the matrix and independence day, green day on the speakers, and a cut-out of monica lewinsky in a corner somewhere. that's the kind of weird/kinda cool/still weird i'm talking about. but it's still kinda cool.as for some more useful observations about this place, the coffee is great, there are seating arrangements for all comfort preferences, and the staff is nice. good people watching, and of course, great location in the heart of wp.tasty coffee. i felt like i was in a friend's basement in my childhood complete with the nes on top of the console tv.and there's a delorean inside.great espresso and drip coffee. given the quality, the prices are reasonable.loved the delorean and all the other 80's tchotchkes scattered around this coffee shop.  so yes, if you are a white male geek/nerd in your mid-thirties, you have found your mecca.not being your classic hipster, i did not blend well into the environs.  but that didn't matter - the coffee was good, the baristas pleasant and helpful, and the pastries tasty.a fun place to grab a cup or quick snack.
