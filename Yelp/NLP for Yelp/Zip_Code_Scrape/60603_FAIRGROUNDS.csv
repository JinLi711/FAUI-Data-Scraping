They make each drink fresh to order and that's what makes it. The drink takes about 5 minutes but it's so worth it. Their pastries are really good as well. I believe they probably just get deliveries from local bakeries. The chocolate donut was amazing and huge. The cinnamon roll was amazing as well-- better than Stan's. The prices are maybe 40¢ more than Starbucks and it's so much better. My only complaint is that they only have about five bar stools and then one lone chair, but the coffee was so good that it didn't matter. We were able to get two bar stools so it worked out.

It was in a beautiful and convenient location to many outdoor ""tourist attraction spots."" They had many different local tea and coffee roasts in shop including Rishi tea, Frothy Monkey , Metropolis, Stumptown, Unicorn Blood, and Circle of Life. And the staff were very sweet and authentic! Those who know me well or follow my posts know I'm a stickler for aesthetic when it comes to cafes and espresso bars. While slightly on the smaller and more modern side of things, Fairgrounds had a great vibe to it with neutral tones, urban coffee products on display and for sale, plus multiple picturesque scenes for all your social media (and Yelp) needs. The baristas even take the time to style the drinks for your photo taking pleasures!The cafe is located right across from Millennium Park right inside a hotel lobby area. Don't let this fool you though, there is plenty of room for seating on the beautiful outdoor patio area for groups when not raining. Like many cafes and restaurants in Chicago, Fairgrounds has a wide variety of colorful planters filled with beautiful, trendy blooms, Spring to Fall, I cannot vouch for what happens in the Winter.Chicago has a million little unique cafes throughout the city and all have their perks but Fairgrounds was best on all levels for me. Strong, smooth, creamy espresso + perfect location for walking tours of the city's best outdoor scenery + kind service + cozy atmosphere. All of that and then some. They do have wifi, outlets, and food options as well for those looking to grab breakfast and/or post up and work.

Let's begin, shall we?I was meeting some friends today, and chose Fairgrounds for two reasons: One, because we'd planned on meeting near Millennium Park, and two, because I wanted to pick a coffee spot to accommodate our seating needs. Unfortunately for me, I misinterpreted the photos I'd found online when it came to seating. The inside of this particular Fairgrounds location only had enough seating for maybe 5-6 people. There was, however, quite a bit of outdoor seating, but we've been cursed with an extended winter/weak excuse for springtime, so that wasn't really an option. The good news is, the shop was located on the ground level of the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, where anyone is welcome to sit in their gorgeous lobby on the second floor. The lovely gentleman at the desk on the ground floor lobby connected to Fairgrounds gave us this information, and the second floor lobby was where we ended up finding many others with Fairgrounds cups as well.I arrived earlier than my friends, and was pretty hungry. I chose a Mexican Chopped Salad from the refrigerator area and bought a medium black coffee. I was a bit shocked at the $13 price tag on this combo, especially since I was only so lucky to find somewhere to sit and eat it while I waited for my friends, so that's something to keep in mind. I've had quite a few large, fabulous cups of coffee for $2-$2.50 at some smaller, local spots, so eek! The salad was very delicious though -- filling, but not to the point of making me tired. The barista also gave me a little bag of tortilla chips to crush up and put in the mix. I liked this little addition, because it ensured the chips weren't soggy once I started eating my salad. Good move, Fairgrounds.I don't really discriminate too much against coffee, though the Metropolis medium roast I chose wasn't my absolute favorite. The good news, though, is that unlike many other coffee shops, Fairgrounds had about 6-7 roasts at the ready, so I could've chosen another that I probably would've absolutely loved. If you are looking for coffee to grab and go, this Fairgrounds location is the perfect spot for that. I'd love to come by when it's warm out to sit in their outdoor patio area.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

There is a small counter with stools and only one table inside, but if you're looking for a place to sit for awhile, the lounge area of the Athletic Association is one floor up the marble stairs and swank.I loved my Dark Matter, medium roast, vanilla latte. It was smooth, sweet, no sugar required, and just the right amount of froth. I'm a huge fan of this label from Chicago, and they also serve a few other independent USA coffee brands like Colectivo, Metropolis, Verve, Four Letter Word, Stumptown, and Frothy Monkey. Fun menu offering...a coffee flight where you can pick from three brands. I haven't seen a concept like this before with coffee.

I stumbled across it one day as I decided to go downtown when it was 97 degrees outside. I quickly realized I needed something iced and headed to the first cafe I could find. I walked up to the counter, sticky and out of breath, and was greeted by a friendly, pleasant, and chill barista. She waited patiently as I scanned the menu, and we had a nice, brief conversation about my tattoo.I ordered Soul Detox, an iced tea with Blueberry rooibos, balsamic vinegar, mint, and berries. I snapped some shots of the inside of the cute cafe while I waited. There are a handful of seats inside, but most of the seating is outside in their patio area. When my drink was done, the barista apologized as they were out of the berries they normally use, and offered an alternative. She asked if I wanted them tossed on or cut nicely. I told her I was going to take a picture of it, and so she smiled and then carefully sliced the strawberry to be put on top.It looked adorable, it tasted great, and her patience throughout was very appreciated. There are a decent number of tables outside, and you can see Millenium Park from the patio. There may be a restroom inside ? They share the building with some sort of athletic club, and I didn't ask (but now realize I should have for the review, dangit).Very impressed overall.

After an early workout in Millennium Park, my friend was dying for her morning coffee. We wanted to support some place local, so we found this conveniently across the street. Once we stepped into this place, the service was incredibly friendly. With so many delicious and unique options, we were taking a while to decide. The server allowed us to try samples of anything on tap, making recommendations along the way. I ended up getting the Vietnamese cold brew and it was absolutely delicious. I raved about it so much that my friend got it the next day when we came back. My other friend got the Sticky Chai Tea Latte, which ended up being a little dessert-y for her, but what did she expect! She did appreciate the flavors of it though. One of the best things I sampled was the Pinot Sage flavored Marin Kombucha... soooooo light and refreshing!There were also a lot of details that we enjoyed, particularly the complimentary sparkling water on tap.

It's got 4-5 pour over coffee makers with wooden aesthetics and a nice backdrop of their menu. They specialize in coffee and matcha. Since - i was up at 6am - i needed their strongest drink and settled with the Matcha Drink with a Double Espresso Shot!! Essentially - a quad shot of caffeine. I think it's called the ferragamo but i coudl be wrong. I wasn't very coherent at the time that she had told me what it was called. Highly recommend it for those who need a SUPER STRONG drink. My friend got a Nitro Iced Coffee - relatively smooth drink and made with Stumptown. FOR THOSE WHO LIKE KOMBUCHA - THEY HAVE KOMBUCHA ON TAP!! Never seen that before.

Hot brews are all made in pour-over fashion.  Really enjoyed the Stumptown iced coffee on tap with nitro!  My wife's mint truffle mocha was also pretty great. Finally, a plug for the unscotti...pretty special. It takes a couple minutes for the pour-over contraptions to do their thing, so friendly baristas are a major plus.

First time I had this was back in August when I was visiting Chicago. My fiancé at the time told me about the rainforest remedy and I fell in love with it. It was so good!!!! Perfect blend of matcha, pineapple and coconut. Didn't think I'd like the three together but I was wrong. I moved to Chicago in December and since it was cold   (More like freezing). the barista told me to try the charcoal elixir, it is a mix of coconut water, dark chocolate and charcoal. It's so rich and tasty but too rich to finish it. Props to you if you can. I always tell everyone that comes to Chicago to try fairgrounds because it is great!!!Their kombucha is tasty. Refreshing and very strong, I had the rose One and loved it.Their coffee is great too.We just went today and wanted to mix things up and have something different. I had the power flower Thai tea. Sounds pretty and tastes pretty good. If you love matcha then you'll definitely love it because the matcha is overpowering in a good way. My hubby had the Vietnamese cold brew and I snuck a sip and it is also very tasty and refreshing.As you can see There hasn't been anything I haven't liked here. I do plan on trying their whole menu. And I'll fill you in if there's something not worth trying.  My all time favorite will stay the rainforest remedy. You have to try it!!!!",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I get the whole vibe of this place is very appealing, but their drinks are not good, and they just overcharge you. I had a pleasant experience with the barista the first time I was there, friendly, helped me decide on a drink. It was one of their mixed drink. Unfortunately, it really wasn't that good and it cost me 5 or 6 dollars. I couldn't really taste all the fancy fru fru they put in there to make it as hipster as possible, and just was a confusing, bland drink. Second time I went, barista could care less about what I wanted. I got another $5 drink (I think matcha latte) which again, was just nothing special. The drink was lukewarm, and I personally didn't like the matcha they are using but that's personal preference. I went back to grab a snack as this was an afterwork meeting (~5pm). The barista (the one who could care less, yup that one) said nothing and charged me 5 dollars for a pastry that's probably been sitting there since 8 am that morning, didn't offer to heat it up, put it on a plate, or anything. I will admit to being pretty stuck up about my coffee as I spent a few years living in Seattle, but I really don't think this is worth it.",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

So today I went to Fairgrounds Coffee & Tea that just opened on Michigan Avenue across the street from Millennium Park. I got an iced coffee on this warm day. It was Metropolis Coffee, which is to me the best coffee. (Chicago Magazine had rightly touted it as Number 1 some time ago.)  So the coffee was terrific, much better than any coffee I've had at Starbucks.I also had the turkey and cheese wrap, which was wonderful. I liked the lettuce and tomatoes in it, as well. The ambiance is modern with outdoor seating. You can people watch and see various skyscrapers, such as the beautiful Crane Communications Building.
