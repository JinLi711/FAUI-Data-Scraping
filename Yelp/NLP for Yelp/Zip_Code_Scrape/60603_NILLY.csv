I'm so glad I convinced my boyfriend to make the 2 minute walk across the street instead of eating in the cafeteria.The people working there were so very friendly and attentive. The beautiful cashier (an exchange student from Greece) took her time to chat with us. They gave us suggestions and even let us sample the Gelato. Let me not forget to mention that the place is very clean and the ambiance is very cozy as well. We ordered the gyro and the meatball sub.  They both came with a little side salad and were both very delicious (we couldn't have found anything close to this at the cafeteria at the art institute for sure). Our food was ready fast and the chef even stopped by later to ask us how our food was.We decided to get some espresso and Gelato for dessert. We had the pistachio and hazelnut flavors and they were both very tasty and thick.We had some spanakopita and apple pastry to go which we devoured later. They were both so good and fluffy. I like that their pastry and their Gelato is not too sweet and of course that they're all made in house! So very impressed with the service and the hospitality.

I noticed their logo contained a cartoon witch, which is a mascot I personally think more businesses should feature on their branding year-round! There was also plenty of outdoor seating, which is always a plus during these warm months. I was pleasantly surprised at how large the inside of the coffee shop was, especially since it was in the Loop near Michigan Avenue. There were plenty of open tables and couches, even though it was mid-morning in such a bustling area. The staff behind the counter was warm and welcoming, and I immediately noticed a giant spinning ice cream wheel behind the counter. I later learned that it was actually a GELATO wheel. Even better. I was there for a meeting and was pretty tired, so coffee was my go-to on this particular morning, BUT now I know that this is a great hidden gelato spot as well. Their coffee was great, though admittedly I'm rarely one to complain about a classic medium brew. They sell Lavazza, because Nilly is focused on Italian fare. Their coffee was a little pricier than some other smaller shops I've visited, BUT they're independent and in the Loop, so it kind of makes sense! Nilly Cafe was another impressive stop on my seemingly never-ending tour of Chicago coffee shops, and I'll definitely keep it on my radar to suggest to others looking for unique coffee spots in the city!",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/Im12MvtKw87eT9dZ9SKkEw/30s.jpg,,,voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

It's really close to The Art Institute and opens before the museum, so it's a great place to grab a coffee and breakfast before heading over. The owners and staff are all so sweet, you can tell they take pride in what they do. I ordered a Vanilla Rose latte and my barista recommended a different rose flavor combination (Angel Cream and rose, I think?) that was very delicious. They also make most of their pastries in house! I got a pistachio gelato which was excellent--super creamy, tons of flavor, and a generous portion at a reasonable price point. Considering the proximity of this cafe to Millennium Park, I think it's definitely on the cheaper end of the spectrum and the quality can't be beat. Plenty of seating options, including comfy leather armchairs that you can relax in. Oh and the whole place is spotless! Super clean but still feels cozy, not sterile. Overall I'm very impressed. It's an adorable family owned cafe that bakes their own products and makes most of the items from scratch.
