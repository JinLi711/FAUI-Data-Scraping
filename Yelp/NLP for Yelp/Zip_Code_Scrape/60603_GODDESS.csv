I came across Goddess and The Baker and was delighted by their display of desserts and baked goods. The place is fairly small and has limited seating, so I decided to grab an order to go. I was trying to keep it on the healthy side, so I opted for the Grilled Salmon Kale Caesar salad. Lunch hours everywhere are pretty chaotic, but this place can get crowded to a whole new level. When I walked in I wasn't sure where the order line starts and I stood behind someone for about 5 minutes before I realized that they were just waiting on their order and people were going up at random to place their orders. Either way, it took about 10 minutes to get my salad and that's understandable. After all the salad does say it comes with a 6 minute egg and it is a lunch rush, so I wasn't that upset about the wait. I took a look around the place while I was waiting, and they have a large variety of baked goods. From muffins to macarons to cookies to brownies, they literally have it all. They also sell alcohol, which I guess can come in handy during one of those work days!After getting my salad and heading back to the office, it was finally time to dig in. The presentation for a take out order looked extremely appetizing, however, they overfilled the plate and kale was falling around all over my desk and floor. The salmon was extremely dry and had a terrible aftertaste. I just put that to the side and ate the rest of the salad. I was pretty disappointed because it cost about 15$ for the salmon and I couldn't bare to finish it. Everything else however tasted really good and the salad was extremely filling. This place is definitely worth another chance. I'll be sticking to the bakery items though!",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tTW8fDufGVciVV5WQtoBug/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goddess-and-the-baker-chicago?reviewid=XumpGFRozqXCbCYpvO2mKQ&select=tTW8fDufGVciVV5WQtoBug,voted for this review,Christine B.,javascript:;,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

It's very disorganized and crowded, at least in the morning.

The Gold Glitter Latte was nothing special - literally edible glitter sprinkled on a latte - but it definitely makes a great photo.

I loved the presentation. My wrap was super fresh and the goddess dressing with the hummus tasted amazing. My husband got the Santa Monica turkey sand which and said it was pretty good. Their chips were small kettle cooked and came in 3 varieties, we got bbq and salt and vinegar. When we left we checked out their pasties and wanted to try one so bad but we were too full! Overall this was a great place for a healthy fresh quick lunch. Next time we are in the area we will have to go back to try one of their sweeter options!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/x9ECbn66tRC6T8RVlsCsBw/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goddess-and-the-baker-chicago?reviewid=EqbqaJODHGB88iV9aLgTgg&select=x9ECbn66tRC6T8RVlsCsBw,voted for this review,Christine B. and 4 others,javascript:;,Useful,3,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

All were enjoyable, if a tad sweet. Plenty of seating as well. A little pricey (a specialty drink will run you about ~$6) but right in line with other hipster type cafes.

I'd like to pause from my muffin assessment to point out that there is an entire menu section called ""liquid chocolate"". I don't really have anything else to say about the muffin.There were several different coffees on their coffee board including drips, and pour-overs. I had the Jumpstart Chicago Brothers after asking for the boldest tasting thing. It was OK. Definitely a little acidic for my tastes and not as strong as I would've liked.My wife had a Ginger Pineapple Tonic from the juice menu which tasted a whole lot of pineapple without having without much of the other juices that were supposed to come with it coming through (including cucumber orange coconut water and ginger.) The juice presentation was really kind of extraordinary with all kinds of leaves, stalks and flowers shooting out of the top. It's almost worth getting a juice, even if it didn't taste great, just to see one.They were out of oatmeal (which my wife wanted) so they offered anything else on the menu as a replacement (which was awfully nice). My wife got the granola which she thought was tasty and satisfying.She also got green jasmine tea from there somewhat extensive tea menu, which she thought was floral and tasty. There were lots of things on the menu which would have suited our separate vegetarian and gluten free diets, like breakfast sandwiches, toasts salads, other sandwiches, and many other baked goods and types of drinks we didn't get to try. We definitely would come back and try a lot more from this menu with particular attention in the future paid to the liquid chocolate menu.I wish our server, or the person who took our order was a little bit more about what was going on, she had trouble making a coffee recommendation...she said she didn't drink coffee and got confused when I asked if I could have my coffee in a mug (as opposed to in a paper cup). She also took the touchpad away before I could select the type of receipt I wanted and she made a selection for me.They also serve alcohol, and three different types of water on tap... Room temperature distilled call distilled and bubbly distill. So in the end it wasn't a perfect experience...but it was an intriguing enough place with many many options that would definitely have us give it another shot.

My wife got their strawberry bread which was very good. It had a legit strawberry flavor not a fake one. I ordered the cinnamon roll which was good but very very sweet.

Unfortunately she was incorrect- the cayenne not the cinnamon accounted for all the spice.There was cinnamon in it but the cayenne just totally overpowered everything else in the drink. If you have a headcold then this is the drink for you; otherwise, I do not recommend it.  I ended up adding a lot of half and half to it and then I could drink it.

Typically I just order things to go as it is pretty hectic to order and wait in line during lunch time. Most of the time things go smoothly and the food is tasty, but the reason for me deducting 2 stars is from them changing up their menu, not always for the best. I originally fell in love with Goddess over the kale and toasted barley salad. I started ordering it 3-4 years ago and would often get it once per week. I LOVED the big box of salad that came with the multi-seed crisps, yum! One day I ordered it though and they changed things up -- the salad started coming in a shallower container (noticeably less food), and they started chopping it/preparing it differently. I tried it for a while but it just wasn't as tasty and they also stopped giving the seedy crisps with it. This lead me to stop ordering it all together. Bummer! :(Now on to the avocado toast.... oh man... this has also been one of my favorites on the menu. I've been ordering it for years, and just went today to find out they switched this up too!! :( :( It used to come topped with a delicious herbed ricotta. I just opened my box up today to find it sprinkled with cotija cheese instead. Because I frequently order this online ahead of time, I don't read the description each time, I just trust that I am ordering the same delicious avocado toast. I looked back and can see they updated the description, but I wish they would have renamed the item to warn that it is different -- I don't think I would have ordered it if I knew it now came with cotija cheese. Not sure if this is just a temporary change, but I would advocate to bring back the ricotta -- it just goes so well!Finally, I haven't ever left a review for Goddess before, but my only other comment would just be about consistency from order to order. I've ordered the avocado toast probably a hundred times, and sometimes the accompanying arugula salad is completely drenched in dressing and is soggy, other times it is completely dry as if a handful of dry greens was tossed on top. I love the days when it comes out just right -- nicely dressed but not soggy. I would hope there would be a way to make this more consistent from time to time. Hopefully this change isn't forever, but I'll probably be taking a break for a while because of this.",,,Was this review …?,,,Useful,,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

This girl have been searching for a cafe that can serve a good cup of matcha latte since the last time I was in Chicago and I'm so thankful to find it here. I needed a place to chill while I waited for my friend to clock out of work and found this place that was close by. The decor of this place was super adorable and cozy at the same time. I went to the other branch they have on LaSalle, but it didn't have the same feel as this one.I ordered the matcha latte and also the dripped coffee. First sip of the matcha and I was in love and decided that this cafe will be my spot from now on. The dripped coffee was also strong and woke my butt up! I wanted to tried other drinks they have on the menu beside the matcha latte so I tried their detox tea. I forgot which one I had, but I remember it has lemongrass in it. I like it and recommend to add a bit of honey to it because it's on the bitter side. Another drink that I like is the Honey Wildflower Latte. The perfect amount sweetness to the espresso. Make sure to stir it up since the honey is at the bottom.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PkfNDpGp5uD-KN_LqkJNgw/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goddess-and-the-baker-chicago?reviewid=yJHnIYc7EButOxGUQ9cmdA&select=PkfNDpGp5uD-KN_LqkJNgw,voted for this review,Liz T. and 1 other,javascript:;,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

This location on Wabash is a quick hop, skip, and jump away from all the shopping on Michigan and State St. I came here for something to eat after a little shopping endeavor. Walking in, I was impressed by how nicely decorated the shop was. This is any instagrammer's dream: nice bright signs, adorable decorations, and pretty pastries. There's also plenty of seating. A huge community table is in the middle of the bakery and a few side tables line the walls too. However, there aren't too many outlets here. So, if you want to get some work done here, I would highly suggest making sure all your electronics are charged before spending a few hours here.Aside from the adorable decorations, they also have an expansive menu filled with lattes, tea, alcoholic drinks, sandwiches, salads, cakes and more! All of these items range from classics to specialty items. I decided to go with the honey wildflower latte and the Santa Monica turkey sandwich w/ a side of chips. Both items came out to me very quickly and were equally delicious. I especially enjoyed the honey wildflower latte as it had a hint of sweetness from the honey but mostly carried that great coffee taste we all know and love. Overall, I think Goddess and the Baker is a great place to hang out with friends while getting coffee and other good eats. While they do offer a good amount of seating, it is often crowded.

After it became evident it was NOT coming I went to the counter and was told I had been asking the wrong person and and to order it again. It finally did come out (served by the same person I had been asking).The food was excellent. I had the Breakfast Burrito and she had the Avocado Toast.

There are plenty of options both on their drink menu and on their food menu, but you'll find that many of the items on the food menu are on the sweet side. It looks like they have many pastries and drinks that rotate out seasonally and there's something for every set of tastebuds here. One of the big draws of Goddess and the Baker is the giant ""Eat Now Caffinate"" sign located inside the restaurant. You'll notice that it seems to have a magnetic effect on tourists looking for a cute spot to get a drink, snack, and Instagram post all in one. The staff is very nice and helpful when it comes to making suggestions for drinks from their vast menu. The one major downside of Goddess and the Baker is that due to its popularity, it can be hard to get a seat inside the restaurant.

Knowing that you had to go up and order rather than them asking made it easier. My friend was confused at first, just as I was the first time I went, because there's no sign that says ""order here"" and no employee tells you either. The weather was perfect so we sat out on the patio. Cake slices were big and delicious as usual. My friend was concerned that he spent about $14 on a cake slice and latte, but I reassured him it was worth it. He loved the carrot cake and was impressed at the size of the slice given to him! Still knocked a star off because of the service. Our table in the patio was the most enclosed in the fenced area. Aka it was hard to get out between the 5 of us and two other tables filled with people. When the waiter brought us our cake, we asked for forks and he said it's inside. We looked at each other for a split second and he left. So..he can tell it's hard for us to get out and yet doesn't offer to get us forks. He came back again a second time and we subtly hinted again if he could maybe get us forks but he did not.I get that maybe it's not in their job description because it's located in a self-serve area, but a few forks would be nice! *TLDR; cakes are a must, order at the cashier, grab water, forks, and napkins before sitting down.*",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AtyOUM2P6b4KHZi5RHvQsQ/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goddess-and-the-baker-chicago?reviewid=07TKXe3n3cREpCp-b1QWpQ&select=AtyOUM2P6b4KHZi5RHvQsQ,voted for this review,Liz T.,javascript:;,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I don't know if I just had gotten a piece of cake that was older, or if all the cake tastes like that but to me it tasted stale and like it had been sitting in the refrigerator for awhile.

And some beautiful sweets too. Located right across from the Silversmith Hotel where I stayed, Goddess and the Baker was packed when I arrived on Sunday during brunch time. There are not a lot of seating inside so you might have to wait for a chair. The middle table is like a picnic table. Then there's two people tables on the side and some high top chairs. There's also a very cute lounge chair area by the window for two people and a small table outside. The menu includes fruit, yogurt, sandwiches, salads and a bunch of pastries in the window display. Everything I ordered was great! Avocado toast: the sourdough was nicely toasted. The herbed ricotta plus smashed avocado was such a creamy savory blend. They really complimented each other. Super seed avocado: the mixed greens was really good with clementines. And it was my first time having avocado with chia, flax and sunflower seeds and wow!!! It was so good. Crunchy and squishy, savory and peppery. Açai bowl: the açai tasted very good, lots of banana flavor. It was topped with granola, coconut flakes, chia and flax seeds. The to go  size of the bowl was more like a cup. I think the dine in size is a bit bigger.

I was a bit skeptical about Goddess and the Baker, because they're doing a LOT of things. Coffee, tea, juices, beer, wine, boozy drinks, baked goods, breakfast, toasts, salads, sandwiches, soups, and snacks. I'm often wary of places that try to juggle too many menu items at once, as they often fail to do anything of them right. When I first came into Goddess and the Baker, I was parched and needed a drink. I opted for their ginger pineapple tonic, which had pineapple, ginger, cucumber, lime, orange, and coconut water. The juices are juiced fresh in-house, but they are pricey. I did enjoy my ginger pineapple tonic though, and I liked my BF's kale apple cooler (kale, Fuji apple, cucumber, lemon) too. The next morning, I came back here for their matcha lemonade. I'm a matcha fiend and it was difficult to decide between all the matcha offerings here (latte, lemonade, or tea), but I ultimately decided to go with the lemonade. I'm very glad I did, because it was really good and I finished it very quickly. I also ordered a sunrise burrito, which has eggs, cheddar, black beans, avocado, and pico de gallo. The sunrise burrito was decent, although I've had much better breakfast burritos from California so my expectations are high for any kind of breakfast burrito. I would definitely come back to try more of their drinks (e.g. Goddess gringo horchata, Mayan mocha, honey wildflower latter, butterscotch latte, matcha latte, s'more frappe), toasts, etc. The space isn't too big, but there are a number of tables (outdoors too) and the interior is modern and hip.

The bread was just hard and crumbly, and the rest of the ingredients seemed oddly set apart from the bread, not a cohesive meal really. Overall I found it disappointing for the price point, a $35 price tag on two drinks, two breakfast items and a fruit cup. I wouldn't specifically seek out Goddess and the Baker again for breakfast, but I might return to check out some of the baked goods.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gt8MESnBsgR0OSzC-Aj2fg/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goddess-and-the-baker-chicago?reviewid=zaKMvFhD7C7_T55n2cBmNw&select=gt8MESnBsgR0OSzC-Aj2fg,voted for this review,Kate K. and 2 others,javascript:;,Useful,3,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Actually, we liked the coffee quite a bit.   I got the goddess gringo horchata and my bf got a mocha frappe.  Both were quite delicious.My problem lies in the service.   I'm a food service worker myself and I give a lot of allowances and mostly never complain.  However, when I'm unhappy with the service it usually leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. First there didn't seem to be any sense of urgency.   Not that I like to be rushed, it wasn't that.  The kids at the register just didn't seem like they wanted to be there. I finally get to order and am asked if I want the mocha frappe large or small.  I say large and the barista pops over and says it only comes in one size.   I reply this is ok and the girl at the register tells me I can only have the smores or the almond joy frappe.  Well I don't want either, I want a plain mocha frappe (which is clearly on the menu.)  Then the barista gets annoyed looks at me like I'm an idiot and says you can have a mocha frappe but you can only have it in one size.   Listen if I was being irate I can maybe tolerate this answer but I wasn't.   I actually didn't say a word because I was thinking about which my bf would rather drink.   Don't be mad at me because the girl at the register has no idea what she is doing.Then I had to wait a very long time for 2 drinks.  It was a good 5 minutes.  There were 2 people who ordered behind me (one at the other register and one behind me) and they both got their items before I did.I also ordered a muffin which I know she heard me say because I had to tell her twice what I wanted.   I didn't get a receipt (technology) but as I'm waiting to get my drinks I realize I have no muffin.   I go back to the girl and she CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER SERVING ME!   I was standing there in front of them for over 7 minutes.   You don't remember me?  I do the math in my head and realize she never rung me up for it and then she tells me oh I can ring you up for it. What?  No thanks, I do not want it any more.  We decided to sit instead of taking it away and no joke the 2 people at the registers were just standing there talking and laughing.   Seriously do some side work.   Maybe clean the dirty tables or greet the customers as they walk in. Luckily the coffee was very delicious and I'm sure that muffin would have been as well.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qLWdhS5TCWjtWd1BaGrmAA/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goddess-and-the-baker-chicago?reviewid=vDQnijew-0kO7n_U3XGR2g&select=qLWdhS5TCWjtWd1BaGrmAA,voted for this review,Kate K.,javascript:;,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Interior decor is really visually-pleasing with big arm chairs window-side and bright. It felt like I was at some cool hipster cafe in LA or NYC. The array of pastries at the front counter of the store is featured behind glass and is plentiful but on the pricey side. We decided on getting a snickerdoodle cookie ($3), matcha chocolate chip muffin ($4), and a strawberry matcha latte to share ($5). The drinks menu was pretty unique and hard to choose from! They offer a good selection of trendy drinks and although the person who took my order seemed new/confused about the featured ingredients in the strawberry matcha latte, it was very rich in matcha and delicious! The cookie was fairly large and on the thick side and I liked how the cinnamon flavor came through. The muffin was warmed which made the chocolate drizzle on the top all gooey and tasty, but the only qualms I had with this muffin was that it did not remotely taste like matcha. In fact, when I cut it down the middle with a knife I saw large green specks throughout the muffin, indicating that food coloring was used. It honestly just tasted like a green chocolate chip muffin more than anything.

They have a entirely menu section called liquid chocolate. As a huge chocoholic I was instantly in love. I had the almond joy frappe and was transported back to my childhood when I used to eat them all the time. They mimicked the taste perfectly. My friend got some type of brownie? Didnt taste it but it looked delicious. The wifi worked well. They have the cutest sign (I'm on a mission to find all the instagramable places only) as well.Why 4 stars then? Space issues. I understand this place is near the loop and cramped. But while we were there and waiting for seats it was clear that some other customers had been there for much longer and showed no signs of leaving. One such person was just chatting on her phone long after all her food was done while we were cramped into a corner. I can't blame the business entirely for this  I understand that it can be hard to tell a customer to leave but it made our experience *and many others* much less enjoyable. Overall I would return-even if only for the liquid chocolate drinks but maybe at a less busy hour.,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EzaeH-ySiUgd6NyFx_oB2A/168s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goddess-and-the-baker-chicago?reviewid=CK_9cULrBzXrmNTtAkxsbg&select=EzaeH-ySiUgd6NyFx_oB2A,voted for this review,Joseph P.,javascript:;,Useful,,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Food and pastry always stun as well, but I'm all about these marble counter-tops and rich oak-looking table tops. It makes work feel efficient. Did I mention their amazing music choices? Right now, some fantastic funk music is blaring through the speakers. While crowded here on a late lunch hour of 1pm on a Thursday, it doesn't feel chaotic --- it feels strangely exciting. You have to understand, this bakery is incredibly crowded, so if you need to love your introvert at a cafe, this is probably not the locale for you. However, if you need a bit of noise to cancel out the pounding in your head, if you want to sit elbow-to-elbow with some folks and really get to know someone well in proximity if not through conversation well---look no further.If you're a sucker for a well-designed space, super friendly staff, and music that makes you want to jump up and start dancing, this is your place to work. If you love pastry that is well done and cheerful, also your place. They also have the BEST, healthy sandwiches should you choose to dine. But, I usually err on the side of a coffee (drip) or tea (jasmine). Tea is a bit pricey at $3.89 given the convenient location between Millennium and the green line on Wabash.

I came to Goddess and the Baker with some friends, having heard about this spot for some friends, but mainly having seen pictures of this place on Instagram. Naturally, that meant I had to check this place out. What this place really has going for it is the atmosphere. Sure the EAT NOW CAFFEINATE sign is gimmicky, but I loved it. I ordered a rainbow latte, which wasn't really rainbow-colored; mine was just blue/green. It tasted good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I've heard the pastries/desserts here are good, but I didn't have a chance to try any. While it was busy, if you can find a place to work here, the table spaces are fairly large, and there are plugs in the wall (unfortunately, if you need some juice for your laptop, you're fairly limited to sitting at the tables hugging the walls).I can definitely see myself coming back to Goddess and the Baker when I want to get some work done.

So I've swung by three times since my last review and decided it was time for an update. The first two times I went their wifi wasn't working so that was a bit annoying because I was trying to do some studying before class. Seemed like the other customers were having issues with connecting to their wifi as well. However, I learned on my third visit that you can easily connect to the Peach and Green wifi.As for the drinks, I've tried the honey wildflower latte and sweet matcha latte. They were both really DELICIOUS. Highly recommend those two. The baristas also do an awesome job with their latte art. I decided to give the raspberry matcha cupcake another try and it was way better this time. I could actually taste the subtle hint of matcha, which paired really well with my sweet matcha latte. It was basically the perfect combination for a matcha lover like me.This place is seriously always so busy! Especially in the mornings. It can be a bit of struggle to find a spot if you decide to have your coffee there. I usually end up having to sit in between two other people at their communal table. Not ideal but it happens.

I was in downtown Chicago with a colleague and we needed a quick bite to eat! The atmosphere is very relaxed and colorful! The pastries and desserts are beautifully displayed and other items such as cups, shirts, etc are also scattered around the store. There's definitely a little bit of a urban style that mixes well with the feminine colors and touches. The food itself was really good. I got the open faced chicken salad with dill and it was fantastic! It came on three grilled pieces of sourdough bread with a couple of kettle chips on each. The dill was a great touch and bread was nicely grilled. Macaroons were only ok, but I'm very picky when it comes to macaroons. Would suggest if you just need a place to work or chill with a friend.

I had my lunch and I was craving for something sweet. Perfect opportunity to go to a bakery! There was so many options to choose from but I decided to get a matcha muffin. I placed my order, paid and had to wait for 8 minutes until someone just picked up a muffin and placed it in the beg. EIGHT MINUTES! (I remember it clearly as I had to return to work and I did not really had much time to spare). While I was waiting all associates seem to joke around caring less about my wait. When I finally received my food, I had a bite and it tasted more like a regular chocolate muffin, having no matcha flavor whatsoever. It had unnatural green crumbs in it that reminded me food choices during St. Patrick's day and made me feel like it was a leftover after the holiday. I never trash food and I am very against food waste, but that muffin definitely belonged to garbage as I could not even finish a half of it.

It was walking distance to the hotel and we passed it several times so when I was finally cheesed out from all the deep dish I could eat, I ended up here. I ordered the Vietnamese cold brew and Santa Monica turkey sandwich. My cold brew was surprisingly delicious. Just sweet enough and just strong enough. It was good to the last sip! My sandwich was good as well. The bread was sturdy and hearty. I saved half the sandwich for later and it didn't get soggy or fall apart. The turkey-avo-arugula-tomato was a good combo, it's hard to argue with that. I browsed the bakery goods while I waited for my order. Everything looked very decadent.

I was doing work on my computer and the wifi is fast, outlets are located in good spots. -Iced Strawberry Matcha Latte: A little pricy, but it was delicious! As many have stated, it is just a regular matcha with some strawberry syrup so maybe next time I will opt for the plain match. -Salmon Kale Cesar Salad: It was a little bit smaller than I would have expected and pretty heavy on the dressing. Overall was yummy but the salmon was just ok. Wished that it was a little bit larger and that dressing was a little less. -Carrot Cake: Also pricy ($7 for one slice?) but it was soooo good. I am a big fan of carrot cake and very picky when it comes it flavor. Don't know if I can often get a $7 piece of cake but overall it was worth every penny. They have a bunch of other little treats, cute cookies, and other cakes that all look AMAZING! Overall: I will return. This was a great study spot and the food was yummy.

This was the Pistachio Mocha cake which was absolutely fantastic. There were several layers to this cake and depending on where you took a bite, you'd get a different ratio of pistachio to mocha cream. The other elements of the slice were also fantastic, from the nice thin layer of chocolate to top the dish to the delicious fresh cream that surrounded it to the roasted expresso bean on top. The presentation was also wonderful.I'll be back here as soon as I make another visit to the area.

I went with the wildflower honey latte and a gluten free lemon bar that I saved to have with my lunch later that day. I had a wait a decent amount of time to get my coffee (to-go) as there was only one person making both the hot and cold drinks. They had a wide variety of baked goods like cookies, bars and pastries but not a lot of breakfast pastries like muffins and croissants. I wasn't thrilled about my latte but I also wasn't mad about it, but I hoping for more of a floral taste and it just tasted like a sweet latte. Tons of people were picking up orders to-go. This place looks like it has a good lunch menu and it would be a great place to sit down and get some work done or to go for a mid-day break. I will probably come back if I'm in the area again and need to grab lunch with friends or co-workers but for now I'm only giving it 3 stars.

Located in the bustling city filled with tall buildings and honking cars, this gem filled with delectable treats was waiting for me, calling my name. Being the avid sweets connoisseur, I anxiously stood in line while staring through the glass full of buttery desserts.My friends are all huge coffee drinkers, but for me, I would choose desserts over coffee.I ordered the drip coffee (free with purchase and yelp check in!) while all the other girls decided to go for the assortment of bougie coffee this cafe offered.I took a few sips of the Mayan Mocha and it was thick, creamy, and delicious. It was so good, I was tempted to get back in line just to order it. The long line won, and I decided I was already completely satisfied with my apple oat cookie and drip coffee.I'm currently in a cookie monster phase where I devour all the cookies I could get my hands on. The apple oat is this baker's current seasonal cookie. I was reluctant to place an order since I don't really like sweets with apples in it , but the cashier told me it was his fave so I decided to give it a shot. Definitely was impressed- not too sweet and chunks of real apple.Sooo good. Would love to try out the other types of coffee and pastries this place has to offer next time i'm in the area again.",,,Was this review …?,,,Useful,,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Goddess And The Baker is the one of the best cafes I have ever been to. Every time I am in Chicago, I make sure to stop by and visit this spot. I also am hesitant to pay $5 for a hot chocolate and $3 for a macaroon, yet every time I visit here, I find myself spending way too much on my post lunch dessert.The atmosphere of this place is great. The way the desserts are organized and presented makes it easy for you to make up your mind. The menu has clear descriptions of what all of the drinks are so you know exactly what you are ordering. However, this place is usually packed, so it's hard to find a seat. Your best bet is probably a to-go. Also, it gets a little loud, so I don't think this is the spot to spend an afternoon studying or have an intimate conversation.I LOVEEEE their drinks, particularly their hot chocolate. It's extra thick and creamy, but not to the point where you feel overwhelmed. My favorite drink there is the Mama's Hot Elixer, which is this perfect combination of their hot chocolate and some other ingredients that give it a nice little kick. Not a lot of places can pull of the ""spicy"" and ""sweet"" drink, but this place does it. Their macaroons are also soft and tasty, but not too sweet. They also have a large variety of macaroons (maybe about 10-15 flavors). These are some of the better macaroons I've had.There's a reason I make an effort to visit this place every time I visit Chicago. It is worth the trek and I would HIGHLY recommend it. It's a few minutes from Millennium Park and the Bean, so if you're in town, I'd recommend making the trip to Goddess and The Baker.",,,voted for this review,Gabriela H. and 3 others,javascript:;,Useful,2,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The Salmon Salad was my favorite even though i'm a sucker for avocado toast! Loved how the Salmon was prepared, not over cooked, but had a slight charred/smokey flavor to it and the fillet broke up very easily! The pairing of the tortilla chips were perfect!!!
