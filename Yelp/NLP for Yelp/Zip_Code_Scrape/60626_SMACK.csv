Lastly the biscuit?  Was this really homemade because it sure didn't taste like it?  The only place in Chicago that has good homemade biscuits is ROOST on Irving Park,  no place even comes close!   Finally, I waited approximately 10 min. before it came out of the kitchen to me and it was served lukewarm, not hot like the person's meal that was sitting next to me.  His looked good, mine did not. Although it appeared he ordered a different type of egg sandwich his came with ham and I could see the steam coming from it... it looked fresher and edible.  I'm in no hurry to go back there, but if I do maybe I'll try their donuts.  But my expectations would be entirely different.   Hard to screw those up.  But who knows ???",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I heard about it from a good friend in the hood who said it was to die for...""they have the best breakfast sandwiches"" he says. Well my buddy wasn't being a Sammy Superlative, he was telling the truth.My first sandwich was a gateway drug. Remember the first time you drank alcohol or made it to 4th base? You're hooked after that, can't go back. Your eyes are opened and the world becomes clearer.The winning formula is simple:-start with an egg, spiced up with the magic from that shaker-open up one of those crumbly, pillowy cheesy biscuits -slap some jam (of the customer's choosing:  tomato, onion, or my favorite BACON) on one side-smear some mayo on the other (pay the extra for the chive mayo, it's incredible)-pop that egg in between and wrap that bad boy up!Seriously, it's heaven. From day one, I converted to a Smack Dab evangelist. I've shared these sandwiches with friends and coworkers all over the city and even driven them out to the suburbs on multiple occasions (they are actually really good, almost better, after sitting for 30-60 minutes in the foil).The donuts are good, but not quite as magical as the sandwiches; try one of every flavor you see so you know what they're like.The other baked goods are crazy, crazy good. My favorite is the chocolate pepita bread...omg it's a chocolaty delicious giant muffin-type loaf, and the pumpkin seeds add a smokey savoriness that is unforgettable.The staff at this popup, their bakery on Clark, and the Wellington location are all super friendly, and they recognize you and make you feel like family when you come in.Even though my body is now composed of 23% biscuit sandwich, what sets this place apart for me is what they are as a company...they've followed a dream from a popup to a 3 location business with a cult following, all while staying true to themselves. They periodically send out newsletters highlighting fundraisers or awareness campaigns they're doing...ones I remember are breast cancer awareness themed donuts, gender neutral cookies, and Obama biscuit sandwiches (these were amazing but sold out within like an hour...they had pineapple and ham on them, if only!!).I could honestly go on and on. My only gripe is that now having moved to Lakeview, I haven't been able to get my garlic chive mayo on a biscuit sandwich because the Wellington CTA stop usually just has regular mayo. But even with regular mayo, this sandwich is still at least 70% better than the best breakfast sandwich you've ever had in your life.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

This sandwich was sweet, salty, and absolutely delicious! Super excited to try the cheesy herb cornbread next time! The donuts here was super good as well!

I do not have much experience with vegan foods, but I know a good pastry and those donuts were just that!

I have to start by saying, they get 5 stars for great service and delicious egg cheese biscuits. Fave is bacon jam and chive mayo (like most), but I also enjoy the onion jam. I haven't tried the tomato yet. I've stopped by and I've ordered delivery and the biscuits are always hot and tasty. They get one star off because I really disliked the donuts. For a bakery, I haven't enjoyed any of their baked goods thus far (only tried cookies and donuts) outside of the biscuit. I also tried a guava lemonade the other day, but it tasted more like a grapefruit juice-not very pleasant and the guava got lost in the tartness of the lemon.

I got a coffee to go, as always -- their only sweetener is some organic liquid (agave, maybe?), and that was good. I liked the coffee very much.Since I don't anticipate visiting every day, I got a cheesy biscuit to eat then and a blueberry tart thing for later. The cheesy biscuit is the savory selection. I was pleasantly surprised how light it was; I kind of expected it to be heavy, but it was far far from the dreaded ""hockey puck"" density. Delicious.I saved the blueberry tart for dessert after dinner. it, too, was light and flavorful. It had a really nice texture, and a flavor that was not overpowering or too sweet. Definitely not a savory treat, which it doesn't aim to be. The sweetness and texture were just right. Yummy.To all my friends who live north of Devon Avenue -- you were right.

I am a huge fan of their Cheesy Breakfast Biscuits, Empanadas, and Tiny Pies. They also make amazing donuts.However, my favorite thing by FAR is the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Pistachio Buttercream. I never would have thought of that combo, and it's not something I've seen anywhere else,but it's life changing, and gluten-free! They don't have it every time I'm there, because they change their menu around a lot to add variety... but I'm always looking for it!Being allergic to gluten, there are a lot of impostors out there that claim to be able to provide health(ish) delicious options, but a lot of times fall flat. Smack Dab is not one of them. They make amazing, gluten-free options that are absolutely delicious, and make it so I don't miss gluten at all! Great job guys!
