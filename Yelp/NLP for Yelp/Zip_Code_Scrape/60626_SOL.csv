There's ample seating (currently typing this on a velvety couch), natural light coming from the floor-to-ceiling windows, and unique drinks. I tried the So Fresh and So Green (matcha latte) and the Apple Butter Jeans (their version of apple cider; has homemade apple butter!!). I appreciate their twist on both drinks. I would definitely come back to try their other drinks as well as their food. They serve bowls and sandwiches in addition to pastries from Glazed & Infused and Bang Bang Pie & Biscuits.

I've spent many hours here studying, catching up with friends, and people watching. Some of the kindest, friendliest baristas around, and Simone has always been super welcoming. The first time I came here, I tried their Oh My Gourd specialty latte and wasn't a huge fan, and Simone personally checked in on me and replaced it for free when I didn't like it. That kind of service can't be beat. Their drip coffee, cold brew, and espresso drinks are all meticulously made: I would especially recommend their cold brew! Their specialty drink menu changes seasonally, and I've always loved the interesting, thoughtful flavors they come up with. I recently stopped in and tried the Devin Special, jasmine tea with thyme syrup and steamed milk, and it was incredible. Pastries and food change seasonally as well, and have always been fresh and flavorful in my experience.Though I've moved, Sol Cafe remains one of my favorite coffee shops in the city and I always make sure to make a stop here when I'm in the neighborhood.

BUT... there were some things that just didn't jive with this soul.IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:First, which I think is the most important for a coffee-shop is the coffee. It was way bitter with a slight sour after taste. They should add what hints of flavor or palate the coffee hits next to the name (seems like they switch out the flavors since it's handwritten on a board).Second, is the seating which isn't meant for you to stay long.Third, the awkward service. I'm not a friend of anyone who works there and it was evident. Little things with service could be improved on. When I ask for a lid and you're standing right next to it, instead of pointing me there, could be nice to grab it. If I can't carry everything to a table, be patient; I'll come back to pick up the rest with the only 2 hands I have... plus other (little) things...Fourth, the music wasn't good if you're coming to study or do work. The dance hip hop music seemed out of place on a Sunday morning. And, lyrics about @ss*s make me want to dance vs drink coffee. Suggestion if you want to play hip hop - the Pandora instrumental hip hop station.WHAT I LIKED:There's plugs in the wall which is great if you need to plug in your laptop in the stool areaThe HASH! OMG, the hash was surprisingly fresh and delicious! I really want to give 5-stars just for the food. After tasting the coffee, I was scared what the food would be like and to my loving, it was beautiful (see picture I posted).  Overall, worth it to come, catch up with a friend and eat a bowl of the breakfast hash.",voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Sol Cafe, 1615 W Howard Street (Rogers Park)When I visited: 06.16.16What I got: The ""Q"" (Espresso, ""Q"" syrup, Corn Infused Milk, Smoked Paprika)Drink Review: Delectable. This smaller (6oz) offering was chock full of powerful flavor. The corn infusion in the milk provides an unexpectedly smooth blend with the sweetness of the sweet syrup and slight spice of the paprika. The espresso here played an equal part, neither overpowering nor hiding amongst the other flavors. Altogether, the ""Q"" may be a be a bit of a misnomer, as I had no questions after it was all said and done. Instead, this drink seems more likely to provide answers to quell whatever ails you.Cafe Review: Modern aesthetics and an abundance of wood laden tables offer a welcoming array of seating for this far north cafe. The atmosphere definitely caters to both relaxing on a calm weekend, or someone looking to crank out some work. That being said, the setup seems conducive to sticking around for about an hour or two, but not much longer as there is no strong nook to really settle into for the long haul. Interesting note to be made of the blackboard walls in the restrooms, though the content on which was rather tame for what was technically writing on a bathroom wall.  Additionally, the large front window gives a great, big, wide view of the goings on around the Howard area, which can be rather pleasant on a clear day.

Very cool, trendy cafe. This was my second visit so I got a chance to try two food items and one coffee drink. First visit I tried the turkey torta, DELICIOUS! Second visit I tried the cranes in the sky drink, espresso with orange and vanilla, as well as a different torta with scrambled eggs and avocado. I didn't love it as much as the turkey one (probably because it's kind of sloppy and I'm weird about that stuff) but still good. Ambiance: small but made great use of space. There's a high top bar work/sit space, two picnic style tables great for groups, little tables for parties of two or 1 and a couch area in the back. If you come before noon all the good seating is usually taken but if you come after 1:30 pm people start to leave and you have more choices. Almost all seats are next to outlets for your computers with the exception of the two large picnic tables. Overall, the place is super cute and hipster (there's parking in the back I just found out about) and great for working if you work remote like me. There is access to printing but it's UBER expensive. Like .49 for 1st page, .29 for pages 2-9 and .19 for the remaining. They add on a .30 processing fee and tax. So I printed 2 black and white pages and it came up to almost $2! Say whaaaaa?! In defense of the cafe they use an outside printing company so you don't actually print from them. You send it to the source online and pay through them. So if you just want to go there to work and chill cool.

For how the surrounding area looks, Sol Cafe itself is a clean, trendy place to grab drinks/food. I ordered the Blood-Orange tea, which was nice - fruity and subtle, but with a nice kick of citrus. I also liked how they kept my tea leaves and told me they could make me another batch if I wanted. My friend ordered the afternoon delight, which was... well... delightful! It was light and sweet, and not quite like anything I've had before. He also ordered a red velvet donut, which I did not get to try. They have a selection of donuts from Glazed and Infused, which is great, but they looked a bit stale. There were not any tables open when we walked in, so the staff went out of their way to shuffle people around. Only thing I have to complain about is one of the people at the front got a little pushy about taking our order, even though there was nobody behind us.

Quick splash of water and I was good to go. I have enjoyed frolicking to different coffee/tea joints just because I am too old to go ""clubbing"" and I enjoy some free WiFi with my caffeine buzz. So here's the gist of the visit. Easy to find, easy to park:  Score for me. Staff non pretentious and friendly. Score. Place has nice natural light, a great open layout that I appreciate. There are books available to read if you are so inclined. Drinks:I had their espresso drink called ""The Q"". I really enjoyed it. It has a smokiness to it and such a creamy taste and it didn't harsh my buzz from the caffeine from the espresso.  Yum. They serve Glazed and Infused doughnuts on the weekend so it was a must to pick one of those beauties to go with my coffee. My husband is more simple in nature and had a regular coffee that he enjoyed with his G&I doughnut. The only thing nerving was two lil pumpkins (kiddos) barging back and forth in the ladies restroom making it hard to focus on the task at hand when I went to the ladies room. LolOh by the way, they have chalkboard walls in the restroom that are dope! Chalk available to write any positive message if you so choose.I will be back as I enjoyed the place and will try their own signature grilled sandwiches. I don't mind taking the drive there.

The space is super vibey--spacious, light-filled interior with an industrial-minimal aesthetic. Many two-seat tables, along with a couple tables or larger groups of up to 6, a few pieces of upholstered furniture, and about 10 seats at a bar. There are plenty of outlets for plugging in and recharging. They serve coffee and tea, of course, but I'm now living that caffeine-free life, so I love coming here for their quality herbal concoctions. They always have a good selection of speciality drinks, blending teas or coffee with other interesting flavors. It's stuff you can't find anywhere else. (I'm a big fan of the Dr Feelgood with roobios, hazelnut, and honey; and the Foxtrot with chamomile and mint and steamed milk). Their food fare includes standards like croissants and muffins, but also stand-out doughnuts and some really good food their making in their small back kitchen. I just finished their Flat Falafel sandwich and it was good! Glad to see vegetarian/vegan options and then more glad to find out that they're delicious. If you're in Rogers Park, or passing through Howard transit station, check out Sol Café.",2 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

You can find things here that you can't elsewhere. They opened in an area that may otherwise be perceived as risky to a business person. They have great chai. I'm a regular here for their house-made chai. While the vast majority of places serving chai are pouring it from a concentrate, here that's not the case. Occasionally you'll walk in and they'll be simmering the ingredients cooking up a batch right there behind the counter.In the coffee department you'll find some drinks you won't elsewhere. The ""Q"" is a nice treat now and then when I'm not wanting a chai: espresso, smokey flavor, corn-infused milk, and paprika. There's also a thai drink that uses goats milk (seasonal maybe?) that I like.They have some delicious donuts on Fridays and weekends. The space is available to rent for private events, and they also host special events now and then for the general public. They also do catering.

It has to be that place that ties the neighborhood together. Sol's got everything in spades. The food is unique, affordable and healthy. The music is great. The furnishings are cozy. The clientele leans toward academic, but there's always a good mix of folks. Outlets are plentiful. The design and furnishings are hip and comfy. Plus...donuts!And, oh yeah, the coffee: excellent. These folks know how to make cold brew. They know how to pull a perfect shot. They seem to have good relationships with local, high-end coffee and tea suppliers.

I've been here twice now, and must say I am pleased overall.The decor is an odd, but pleasant ""recycled"" look (Mason jar lights, Tables that look like they were made from barrels) The front of the shop is oddly bare, but I'm betting that's because they are going to have live music come in at some point. The coffee itself is a nice, smooth blend that lacks some of the acid taste Starbucks or Metropolis has, and the pricing is pretty good (less than 3 bucks for a large au lait).The only part they really fell down on was on my second trip, they ran out of coffee and were just starting to make a fresh pot. Unfortunately, they didn't say this before I ordered. They were, however, nice enough to comp me the difference for a Latte.

In addition to your usual coffee, latte, or cappuccino, they have some seasonal options available that are always interesting and worth a try. Pastries and food are also good, and on the weekends, they have donuts.Yes, I love their coffee and treats, but my favorite thing about Sol Cafe is that it is always welcoming and friendly.

The seating is great and various: tables and chairs, counters and chairs, tables and bench, couches, and armchairs. Wonderful food: delicious soups (some of which are vegan) and awesome sandwiches. Also, Glazed and Infused donuts on the weekends - so delicious.

I liked everything about this place and here are the details:First (The Coffee): I got my usual latte and it was amazing. They serve Passion House Coffee, which is a small Chicago based Roaster. I am not sure which blend Sol was using but I think it was the Warehouse Espresso blend. It is wonderfully balanced, has a rich velvety texture, makes a deep dirt reddish crema, and with a nice sweet finish. I would say it is akin to Intelligentsia Black Cat. Second(Service:) The barista who took my order was absolutely pleasant. I didn't get the annoying ""You are bothering me and cramping my hipster coolness"" attitude that some places have. She was helpful in answering my questions about the coffee sources (even though it was written on the board above her head and I was being an idiot). Third(Venue): The place is easy to find and right off the Howard red line. It was fairly quiet for a Thursday afternoon and a nice place to get a bit of work done. They keep the place clean and the decor is more contemporary with a rustic twist, i.e square wood top tables with railway iron legs? The bathroom has chalkboards walls (with chalk supplied) so you can write all over the place without defacing stalls etc. Conclusion: I strongly recommend trying this place out and supporting their business. Tip: They have timed wi-fi. You get two hours with your purchase so if you were planning on getting drip coffee and staying for 6hrs surfing the web, this is not the place.",5 people voted for this review,Useful,4,Funny,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I'm very critical of food and sandwiches in particular, but the ""Hammertime"" sandwich (with Ham, gouda, pesto and hot peppers) was perfectly balanced and incredibly delicious.Will certainly come back in the near future.",Was this review …?,Useful,,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I've been going here for a little while now and I loved the specific drink I got every morning... Addicted may be the word. Needless to say that while on a 3 week business trip I returned to my coffee place of choice and the owner looked very concerned to see me... I picked up on her facial cue right away and realized it was empathy... She told me my favorite drink would be replaced by another seasonal creation.... So I came in and ordered my drink until the ingredients were gone... And then I kinda disappearedI'd say about a month later or maybe a little more I returned... My mission was to pick up donuts to bring to my parents because my dad has been in the hospital for a month and won't stop asking for the doughnuts that come from Chicago... the barista behind the counter says so what are you drinking now that your drink is gone? Just doughnuts I haven't found a replacement for the drink yet I responded.., which was my way of saying so you in another month or more.,, without missing a beat he offered for me try a special drink just an iced coffee that absolutely blew my mind... This place is the kinda place that'll remember your drink when you come in... But not only that... They will share the emotional attachment you make with your morning coffee and you can tell they are passionate about what they do.  Both the barista and the girl who rang me out and waited patiently while I picked out the right donuts for recovering dad started my day off great!

The staff is edgy in appearance but could not have been any nicer. I had a black coffee in a ceramic mug (I hate drinking out of paper cups) and a Hippie Granola Scone. Both were perfection. Plenty of outlets for laptop charging made it comfortable for me to sit and work on my resume for 2 hours. I did not feel rushed at all. They play an eclectic array of music at a volume loud enough to enjoy but not too loud to spoil your concentration. There is also a book section with adult and children's books to borrow with an assortment of classics along with beach reads. Someday, I'll ditch the laptop and come in just to read.

It's a great place to meet a friend for coffee, to bring a book or computer and hang out for awhile, and I've even had staff meeting with my co-workers here as well. I also appreciate the way they seem very intentional about becoming part of the neighborhood, and specifically the Howard area - I remember being afraid that I would only ever see other clientele like myself (young, white 20-somethings), but have been pleased to see a diversity in age and culture that seems to embody the feel of Rogers Park.",Was this review …?,Useful,,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
