We had lunch here on a Sunday.  It wasn't very crowded.  The menu has been significantly reduced since the last time we were here; from reading other reviews, they seemed to have transitioned away from being a restaurant to being more of a coffee shop.  Which is fine - the small menu was still sufficient for our needs.  I had the Rogers Pork sandwich and it was delicious.  Whoever had the idea to put bbq sauce on a ham sandwich deserves a medal.  Seriously.

Although the El runs nearby, it's surprisingly peaceful and relaxing to sit outdoors. As with all Rogers Park establishments, parking is not bad during the day, but next to impossible evenings and weekends. I usually visit mid-day; at that time, the crowds are small, and parking is pretty easy.The coffee is good. The treats are good. The Wi-Fi connection is strong. The staff is friendly and efficient. The other customers are either working on their electronic devices or conducting quiet conversations. Many of the Rogers Parkers I know count Charmers as a favorite destination for conversation, work, snacks, or whatever other socially acceptable thing people do in neighborhood coffeehouses.You do see a few marginal people passing by when you sit outdoors, but that is also typical of Rogers Park. Sorry, citizens of Rogers Park, but there are some strange people in your neighborhood, who are out wandering aimlessly, pissing, begging, and conducting conversations with the invisible people who live in their heads. It's a little unnerving. That's why I typically sit indoors at Charmers, even on nice summer days.I saw recently that Charmers was selling hot dogs. Please, Charmers, include veggie dogs with your selection, and consider getting some vegan treats. Then you'd be as busy daytimes as you are on weekends.Charmers also has the advantage of location. It's only a few blocks from the lakefront. That's a nice walk after you've eaten a scone the size of your head.I recommend Charmers.

The eavesdropping is satisfying (we heard tell of a first edition Kurt Vonnegut) and the music isn't overpowering.Food and drink: My mocha and my companion's iced chai hit the spot.

It is the perfect shop to have at that location, where  it serves as a gathering place for the community, meet up with some friends on the patio and catch up, or a Sunday morning reading/crossword puzzle session. It's also especially for families in the summer to stop by for an ice cream cone or a shake. The new decor is very sophisticated yet laid back, and those gorgeous swinging bar seats can totally be the talk of the town. Staff is very friendly, and seem to really know the neighborhood. For me, I mostly come for the convenient cup of coffee right before my occasional train ride to work. I have never come during the typical rush hour, and so far I have almost never gotten a latte since they aren't quite fast enough for me to not miss my train. The couple of times I had espresso drinks, they were far from perfect. The pastries... are very local, but every time I've given in out of hunger, I have found them to be too dry/staled. Students, if you want a quiet place to study with intense focus, the lighting inside is probably too dim, and people do chat a lot here.I like the fact that Charmer's is here, and it has such an important role on this block. But even after a few months of opening, I don't know if I would recommend it with fervor to people who don't live around here/aren't already passing by.

There is no competition nearby (the only Starbucks is located inside Jewel and is filled with very sad, down-and-out people) and street parking is easy and free in the neighborhood, so it's disappointing​ that Charmers closes at 3 pm. Every time we'd like to go there it seems​ to be near closing time. The seating is creative and comfortable and the coffee drinks are delicious​. The desserts are ​ minimal and​ the cafe often runs out, presumably because the owner doesn't want to stock up since it closes early. The staff is friendly and relaxed unlike the frenetic pace at a Starbucks. The cafe also gives amateur​ singers a chance to perform, which is a kind thing to do for them. Perhaps being in Rogers Park holds back the owners from turning this into a highly popular cafe.",,,Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
