That alone made me a fan within seconds. It does a brisk business and yet there's always seating to be had. The staff is very nice and accommodating, the space is well-maintained, and the coffee and sandwiches are good, and very fairly priced. The only complaint I had, and it's minor, is the donut. Not that good. Frosting, yes. But the rest of it was a little tasteless. But that's small stuff. Robust is well worth a visit. At least three times a week, I bike down from the North Side to somewhere on the South Side or Western Suburbs for exercise and exploration, then work remotely, so I'll be coming in all fall and winter. This place is a keeper. Pro-tip: It will get a little loud during the bottom of the 3:00 hour when a lot of kids roll in rom one of the local schools. They're fine overall, but they are teenagers, so they're going to be a little loud.

HOLY DELICIOUS! Who knew coffee, almond milk and honey could be so perfect?! I will say, it is a bit pricey at almost $5.50, but as a VERY occasional treat, 100% worth it! While I was there I also (calorically, not monetarily) splurged on an amazing double chocolate cake donut. I had to remind myself that I was in public and need not inhale it. Their drinks and sweets are so on point at Robust. Pro-tip: Between 6am-8am all food is 50%!The only downfall is not everyone that works there is kind or efficient. They typically have one person working cash register (and serving simple black coffee) and one person making all of the other drinks, so if you snoozed, you're losing, because you might be 10th in line even at 7:30am! .... totally worth it though for that honey nut latte and donut :)",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The price of $9.37 for a grilled cheese with a few shredded pieces of beef with no fries/chips or a drink...that's SUPER expensive. My friend's total came to $15.37, she ordered a small coffee which btw is $5.50.  It's another $1.75 to upgrade it wasn't worth it.  Also, I would image this venue is relatively new, the space is nice and it seats a great number of people, but the seats are horrible.

The staff used to be friendly and fun! Their reward card is a joke as well-- I got large drinks every time I came here. Fill up the reward card and you get a small (ridiculously small) drink. I asked if I could pay the difference and get my large-- 70 cents more than the small. The reply SHOULD have been no problem, you're a regular customer, we'll cover that 70 cents. Instead it was ""reward card upgrades cost a dollar."" I pointed out that the price difference was less than that, and the rude girl just repeated herself.

It's probably not as loud in the back."" I explained that I was meeting someone who was already set up in the front. But guess what? I had already thought of that solution but I could STILL hear it back there so that's actually why I asked could they turn it down. I don't understand why the volume had to be SO loud when most people were working or trying to have conversations.

Long story:I was driving by this place just after 7am and I wanted a cup of coffee so I tried looking inside and I didn't see anyone, and there was no open sign, so I parked and went in anyways. It was open. So I ordered a large Mocha with an extra shot because their large mochas only come with 2 shots apparently. So I told the barista ""hey you guys should think about getting an open sign, as I just saw someone else drive by slowly looking inside to see if you were open."" Barista replies, ""No I don't think so. Our regular customers know when we are open."" I respond ""it was just a suggestion""Thanks for the pretentiousness, but if you want to run a business then you should make new customers feel welcome. This isn't a social club. If I had gone to Starbucks instead at 7am you would know it was open because there would be so many people.Finally I get the coffee and it tastes like chocolate milk. Even though it's cheaper than Starbucks you have to add enough espresso shots to make it more than Starbucks. Maybe he didn't put my extra shot, or any espresso at all. There was no other people there so that's not an excuse. Maybe business is booming other times, but it wasn't looking so good when I went. I guess the Starbucks at the hospital I work at will do.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Since then, I found out that the advertising for the coffee shake is FALSE. The sign says ""cold brewed coffee, cinnamon, almond milk"". The reality is that they use a coffee mix from a packet that contains tons of sugar, saturated fat, and preservatives. One serving is half the packet, but they put the whole packet in for one shake, meaning the calories START at about 500 just for the mix. The ""cinnamon"" is a syrup, adding more sugar to the drink.At least Starbucks is honest about their ingredients for a comparable drink, the coffee frappucino. And, Starbucks ingredients are better for my health. A coffee shop needs to serve real coffee. There's absolutely no excuse for using a cheap mix.Robust Coffee is lying to customers and lagging behind Starbucks for coffee quality.

I also work in the area, so if the lines aren't very long I love to come in for a hot cup of dark roasted coffee and a pastry to go. It always smells amazing when you walk in. You aren't always greeted with a big smile but the service is always polite and accurate. The menu is just the right size, I hate large menus since I'm so indecisive, but they cover pretty much all the basics from sandwiches to shakes. The place itself always seems to be clean and organized. The environment is mixed, from folks coming in to have a quick business meeting to those just grabbing a snack while they wait for the bus. It's literally a gem for the Woodlawn area. They also have the little stamp cards, so if you frequent often you can get a free drink! Most small cafes don't offer this, but that's a perk that keeps me coming back. I love the 63rd Turkey Club, don't change a thing about it. I haven't been able to enjoy a lot of other options since I'm a busy mom and always on the go, but I can't wait to try their little breakfast bowl. I hate seeing people tear small business apart on Yelp and other reviews sites. Next time try speaking with the owner or manager first before trying to ""hit them where it hurts"". I'm a native of the Hyde Park/Woodlawn area and have worked over here for years, in restaurants, business offices, you name it! Small business owners are more likely to hear your opinion, even if they don't agree they will always hear you out and address any issues you may have. The owner is a very nice guy. :)",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

In the 25 or so times that I've been to Robust, I've tried a LOT of the menu and I have also had a lot of different interactions with different staff. I have not had a particularly consistent experience here, which is why I have held off on a review. I've had some five-star customer service experiences and some two-star customer dr vide experiences. I've had some five-star food and some two-star food. I'm going to focus instead on my overall experience, including the sum of 25 visits to Robust. Overall, Robust is an excellent addition to the Woodlawn community. It's located conveniently right on the corner and it's a meeting place for lifelong residents of the community, as well as University of Chicago staff and students who want to venture a little off the beaten path off campus. Uniform-clad school children can frequently be found here enjoying a snack or beverage after school hours. The diversity of customers at Robust is great and adds to the welcoming atmosphere.The service can be hit or miss. Some of the staff are incredibly kind, patient, and friendly, while others are fairly negligent and inattenive. My orders are messed up maybe 35% of the time, which is not the best. I have had my order forgotten more than a few times. Sometimes, the staff are really apologetic and offer to give me extra flavor or a bigger size to compensate. Sometimes, they barely bat an eyelash. I've tried maybe half of the menu items, including blended drinks like the oreo madness, smoothies like the almond milk, banana, chai, food items like the grilled cheese and hummus platter, the mocha diablo, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread latte, etc. So, why the four-star rating? At the end of the day, I know I can count on Robust to be a cozy haven--a true gem in Woodlawn. Robust has a great atmosphere, acceptable drinks/food/prices, and (most importantly, for me) seating, outlets, and wifi. Seriously, I have never not been able to find a seat or outlet here and that is the most important thing! I will continue to be a happy customer at Robust as long as I work in Woodlawn.",9 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I chalked this up to an ""oops"" and quickly grabbed the simple syrup bottle instead.So when Robust Coffee Lounge comes along and intentionally sells me a ""honey nut latte"", you've caught my attention. And I wasn't sure if it was in a good way, or a bad way.Short answer: in a good way. The honey and rich coffee work together really well, actually, with the flavors complementing each other and not conflicting. The ""nut"" part of the drink (probably almond syrup) was a nice touch, and I think that was what made the whole thing quite sweet. It's an excellent iced coffee, with a rich sweetness.

I placed an order over the phone for two breakfast sandwiches and a shake @ Robust Coffee Lounge on 63rd and Woodlawn. Upon arrival I was informed that they don't take bills higher than $20. Now see this is bs starts. The cashier goes and ask the (white) manager, owner, whatever he was if he could expect my c-note. He looks at me with this jacked up expression on his face then tells her no. I felt some kind of way about the look he gave me. Then the cashier proceeds to inform me there's a gas station 4 blocks away where I could get change. To make a long story short. I come back and my food is cold, shake melted and I'm hot and pissed off not to mention now I have to wait in line. Moral of the story is, if had been a doctor from up the street at the university with a lab coat on I bet it wouldn't have been a problem. Nowhere in the establishment is it posted that they don't except large bills so how the hell can you not honor my cash. I will never set foot in this place again.

Great to get some work done.- Kid friendly, with a book shelf for reading in your down timeThe Bad:- non-dairy milks are all sweetened, which makes any fancy non-dairy latte TOO sweet after the flavouring is added.- a lot of the food is low quality pre-made mixes and packaged products (pancakes aren't fresh made batter, hummus is pre-packaged, the ""cheese"" is orange american style single slices,  breakfast condiments are just Smucker's jams and pancake syrupetc. Skip the food.)- blended cold drinks are made with a packet of pre-mixed artificially flavoured powders (YUCK. Just skip these entirely)- flavoured coffee syrups are cheap, teeth shatteringly sweet and give your latte a chemical taste. Avoid the flavored coffees (with the exception of the homemade Diablo syrup).I want to love Robust, but I can't give 5 stars because they are lacking in quality and attention to detail.

I probably shouldn't have walked into the store with the Starbucks cup but I was moving really fast. When I walked up to the register the girl rudely told me before I order I have to throw out my Starbucks cup because it's a competitor. All the while a young guy stood next to her & stared at me in disgust. I told her I'm not sitting in & I just want to order to go, she rolled her eyes & said go ahead. I should've just left but seeing my child was hungry I just went ahead & spent $5.10 ( which was more than my coffee at Starbucks). However I will never spend another dime in there again because even if you don't tolerate outside drinks/food in your establishment it need to be communicated in a customer friendly way. They acted as if I still wasn't spending my hard earned $ there.  I guess other coffee drinkers $ isn't wanted there. I actually worked at Starbucks years ago & if someone walked to our register with a dunkin donuts cup we didn't refuse their service, what sense does that make?..

We walked in to get drinks and ice cream and when I saw the menu I told my kids maybe we'd come in one day for breakfast. We stood at the counter and there was a girl making a drink. Her hair was awesome but she glanced at us and said nothing. We stood around.  A guy came from the back and made eye contact, but said nothing. We stood around. The girl came over and stood there silently. No, ""hello, may I help you?"" Nothing. My son wants to know if they have ice cream. ""Floats."" He asks again. I try to explain that from her response I assume they only have vanilla ice cream and some sort of flavors of soda. She remains silent. He asks if they have cookies and cream. She shakes her head. Ok, he'll take a cookie. I ask what the shaken lemonade is. It's lemonade with flavors. Ok. We order a lemonade.  I ask how much the boxed water is (because it's fancy and people like to charge ridiculous prices for fancy stuff) She doesn't answer. Ok. ""So you want a cookie, a lemonade and a boxed water?"" No, I wanted to know how much the water is. $2. No thanks. She fresh squeezed (awesome!) the lemonade for my daughter and hands it to me. We walk out and my daughter spits the lemonade out. It's bitter. Unsweetened. Why not mention that? We go back in for sugar.  Maybe I asked too many questions. Maybe I wanted more because I'd just run 3 miles or maybe it was because I kept seeing this place and saying I was going to stop in.

The pumpernickel bread it came on was pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend the sandwich as a whole.I also had a chai latte, which was nice if a little on the bland side as well.

The space doesn't seem to be used in the best way, though I can't put my finger on why it feels this way. There are a number of individual-size tables that are good for people who are there to work on laptops, but many of those are inaccessible to outlets, and the ones by the windows in the front are somehow unappealing -- maybe due to rickety unstable chairs, and maybe just that the tables/area never seems to be clean. That leads me to my second observation, which is that I always get the feeling the surfaces/tables/floor/etc. are kind of dirty.  I'm not at all a clean freak.  But it just doesn't make me want to stay when I usually have to wipe down my table myself before I put my computer down, and there are often pieces of used equal packets, etc. laying around the milk/sugar table. If the coffee were somehow exceptional, neither of these things would matter so much. But the coffee is just average for any Intelligentsia location.  I go to Robust when I have to be on campus immediately afterward, and that's about it.  I know Robust is trying to be this swanky coffee lounge in a neighborhood that hasn't really had that, but if that's the case, the maintenance/upkeep has to be like that of a swanky coffee lounge.",11 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I don't generally seek out chicken salad but for some reason their ""Herbie"" sandwich called out to me. I was intrigued by their homemade chicken salad and it was absolutely delicious! The sandwich also came with provolone and bacon on a raisin pretzel roll. It sounds a little weird but it worked. The treats in their display cases (muffins, donuts, cakes) all looked fabulous.

I was greeted by a horrible experience today. I had a conference call to conduct. I was late for the call and decided to sit down and make the call, I had every intention to purchase something once the call was completed. During the call, I was repeatedly harassed several times by a staff member and once by the owner of the establishment to buy something or leave! Now while I might have worn what you may consider ""urban apparel"" and not a tuxedo this is no way to treat a returning/potential customer! I felt embarrassed during the call with a new hire candidate to halt the call to reassure staff I was going to purchase an item. After the call I proceeded to the register to purchase a coffee and juice and wanted to voice my disappointing opinion to the owner. I was told he ""left"" no more than 10 minutes after confronting me. Whether he was there hiding or really did leave I left my business card and told the staff member who confronted me initially this is not a way to run a business. She began to dribble generalizations and decided to tell me that I was part of a problem that begun after I walked in and another customer sat in their establishment without purchasing. I was floored! On top of the harassment, I'm now part of a conspiracy with a stranger I've never met to waste your resources? She then said: ""Birds of a feather, flock together!"" My brain could not believe what I was hearing. I would say the staff member did thank me for some reason but I felt it was a contrived effort to deescalate the situation before it became worst. In conclusion, as a fellow business-owner I empathize with the daily struggles it takes to run a business and when you encounter a potential customer who may appear to be taking advantage of your gratitude it may feel like a slap in the face. I get it. However, I live one block away, have frequented the business numerous times and was treated like total trash today. I wasn't a bum looking to rudely hassle the other customers for money. I was clearly a busy customer who thought a neighborhood coffee shop such as Robust would be a ""friendly"" place to support and work at for an hour. Clearly Robust has become a product of an environment I thought was long forgotten in the Woodlawn Community even with the surrounding crime/violence. It has in its time active here in our neighborhood turned into a rude place that I will NEVER recommend to be visited to my friends and family for the foreseeable future. I will be mentioning this to my Alderman as well being I live across the street from him. We should not condone this sort of treatment in our community.BE WARNED: ""No Trust in Robust!""

And we still really, really need local businesses in this area. BUT--it appears that standards are slipping. I went with a friend a few days ago. I had the shaken lemonade with mango and it was undrinkable. It was so bitter and acidic that the addition of the mango as well as several packets of sugar could do nothing to sweeten it. I gave up after a few sips. I am not so picky. I don't demand that my lemonade come from inside the lemon no more than three seconds before it is in my glass. But please, spend a little cash and buy a lemon juice that isn't just citric acid with lemon flavoring! It wasn't just me. My friend ordered a coffee drink that he enjoyed until he went to the table by the door and added ""half and half."" He took another sip and nearly gagged on the chemical flavor of non-dairy creamer!Now I know nobody told me there was real lemon juice in my lemonade, but calling non-dairy creamer ""half and half"" is fraudulent.In addition, my friend also noticed that the bottled drinks in the cooler by the register were all room temperature.And word to the wise? If I can smell the tuna on the sandwich the gentleman two tables away is eating, it's not so fresh! Could explain why he left most of the sandwich on the plate.We have plenty of businesses in our area that sell substandard products, or lie to customers. Please don't join them.

It is a quick walk from our apartment and nice to go to. The coffee and coffee based drinks are pretty good. However, the problem comes with the food. First off, it is kind of expensive for what you get. Secondly, they take a horribly long time to do fairly simple tasks. Thirdly, they tend to lose the food tickets a lot. When that happens, they aren't very apologetic and kind of look at you like you're trying to scam them (although they gave you a number for your food and it is still sitting on your table). Most of the staff has changed since we first started coming here and I feel like the service went down when that happened. I would like to still come here since it is close to home and I'd hate for the business to leave since it is one of the few places like this. However, just because it doesn't have any competition doesn't mean that their customer service should suck.10/3/15In the past year or so, Robust has really changed and become a lot better.  It still takes awhile to get food sometimes, but the staff actually being pleasant makes the whole place seem a lot better.",6 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I pray they're involved in what opens next door to even further the coffee shop experience...Wish they'd spruce up the bakery offerings and offer a barely audible slight tilt towards smooth jazz/light reggae riddims to even soften the atmosphere more.

He said that I thought too highly of myself and I said it's not that, I just never had this experience before, not here nor at any other coffee shop.  He said that since it is his coffee shop that he makes the rules.  All I wanted was a little understanding...I wasn't trying to stiff the guy.  I was going to buy something...like I always do and always have...hell last week I purchase an over-prices $10 turkey meat sandwich.  I mean come on...doesn't that get me a few minutes at a table before I'm accosted and a little understanding and respect.Honestly the experience really hurt my feelings and I couldn't believe that the owner would be that rude to me.  I guess the owner couldn't understand :(",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

That being said, I won't give Robust a low rating because I recognize there wasn't much the staff could have done to make it better. I was here in the afternoon, about 3PM, and the café was absolutely overrun with loud, rowdy schoolchildren. The staff tried to quiet them down, but to no avail. I held out hope that maybe there was a special back room into which the children would be ushered and locked into, but no dice. The kids stopped coming in at around 5, although the noise level remained somewhat loud, as many people seem to use this café as a meeting/tutoring space. If not for the kids, this would be a cool place. I had the honey nut latte, which is made with almond milk, and is really tasty. I like that there's a variety of seating and a selection of books/magazines. The service was kind of surly, but I probably wouldn't be too friendly either if I had to deal with those kids for 2 hours. They have a huge sandwich list, but the prices were high. I would not make a special trip to Robust, but if you're in the area, it makes a nice hang-out spot.

We've been needing SOMETHING for quite some time, and lucky me - it's a charming little coffee shop that serves blended drinks, hot drinks, teas, smoothies, various flavors of lemonade, breakfast sandwiches, and an assortment of sandwiches for lunch (try the corn beef on rye....yum).  It also looks like it will be a nice, well lit place to read and to get some work done.  As with any new business, there's at least one kink to work out. For me, it was the waiting time for blended drinks since they currently only have 1 blender.  But I give Robust Coffee Lounge 5 STARS for effort, hospitality, and the great drink I got. With continued business, they'll have more employees, blenders, and the like that will make service speedier.
