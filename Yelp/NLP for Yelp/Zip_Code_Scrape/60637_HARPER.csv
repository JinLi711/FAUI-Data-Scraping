I must echo the previous comment in that this cafe gives off the epitome of a hipster vibe; being a hipster seems like a requirement to work here. I won't hold it against them though (it is a college library cafe after all, and it really just creates a sense of whimsicalness).The tea is pretty great, made from tea leaves, not tea bags. There are big comfy chairs (though they're always occupied in the daytime). They have a good option of prepared foods in their fridge (from Rajun Cajun, Siam Thai, The Nile, etc.) and a wide selection of baked goods. All reasonably priced. Basically a very well-stocked library cafe, making it really easy to literally hibernate 24/7 at Harper library when you're studying.
