They also have a side of the cafe which used to be a house which they renovated. (So cute). It was cozy, quiet and bright enough. They have both couches and table/chairs as options to sit at! They do offer free WiFi. I ordered the Chai Latte (recommend with coconut milk) and the Great Gatsby sandwich. Both were awesome and I'd easily get those both again.

This place is a very quaint little joint to sit, sip a drink and feel special I guess. I bet hipsters love it.Did you know bourgeois really means MIDDLE class? Not even high class, but middle class materialistic. That's a pretty good description of this place. I feel like my reviews are all about my frugality (read: cheapness) and irritation with over-inflated prices. This review is no different.A breakfast bowl, iced chai latte and a scone cost me $20. *Does a Flintstones double take* TWENTY BUCKS for a la carte breakfast?!The berry scone looked pretty awesome, big and crusty with chunks of fruit...but it was the most bland hunk of flour and water I've had since eating motzo. The iced chai latte was decent but standard. Nothing wowed me about it except the $4.50 price tag (and not in the good way)The breakfast bowl was probably the best part but again nothing to write home about. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and the avocado was fresh, but the salsa, sour cream and onion were a bit unnecessary except to inflate the price. It was tasty but nothing I couldn't have made at home much cheaper. On a Saturday morning, there was ONE employee, who took orders and served people individually with absolutely no sense of urgency and zero multitasking skills.

I wanted to support a local independent shop even if it wasn't great. But what i discovered was..well I honestly don't know where to begin... *They are ALWAYS out of everything- food items, chai, coffee, baked goods. I've been there three time when they were out of coffee! THREE TIMES!!*and the coffee they do use is Kirkland (Costco brand) LOL  I not a coffee snob but i don't want to pay $5 for costco coffee*Most of their food is microwaved because it is premade- eggs, paninis (which sometimes come out slimy )*the same pan of scones/muffins sit in the glass case thing for serious a week sometimes. The old mumbling baker just brings up a giant batch and they sit there until they are gone. By day 2 they aren't worth paying for. If I ask they have always been honest (""those were baked last monday"") so that's good at least. *still very expensive $$$ 15$ for a shitty sandwich that comes with a tiny bag of chips  *Plan on waiting 30 mins, over an hour if they are busy due to understaffing and what looks like severe lack of organization/operations. *Have to use your email for 3 hour internet access. Internet doesn't work at all many times. *The baristas are nice but clueless. They always have to check to see if they have what you order. I'm realizing it's probably not their fault though. *The filthy building (which used to be the selling point, and initially what i thought was cool) is crumbling due to lack of upkeep- thick layer of dirt over everything (the ceiling fans & vents are so disgusting), ceiling in the front room leaks BAD for over a year now when it rains or from snow melt (I've seen 5+ buckets to catch watch in the dining room)*I wish I could finish with something good, but after talking about this place I found out that it has a reputation for not paying it's employees. So I asked the two baristas - their reaction said it all - they just looked at each other with wide eyes & acknowledged the problem in a very polite way. More respectful to ownership than i would have been if there was uncertainty in my pay checks. * and end of story, I haven't gone back since. I would recommend anyone and their mother pass on this rotting shit hole in Lincoln Park. ***please see photos***",1 person voted for this review,,,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

We searched the area for a good sandwich spot that wasn't too chain-esque and this place caught our eyes instantly. It is a small duplex that, on the left side, has a small food shop that has a diverse array of sandwiches and salads that are great for both meat eaters and vegetarians. On the right side is a small coffee and tea shop that smells of delicious aromas from the fresh brewed drinks. Food: My girlfriend is a vegetarian but was in the mood for a sandwich instead of a soup or salad. She created a delicious build-your-own-sandwich with greens and a variety of cheeses on sourdough bread. It came out steaming and gooey while not sloppy; the bread was pressed and crispy on the outside yet softer as it approached the cheesy center. I ordered the Great Gatsby sandwich which was at the top of the best sellers list and I can completely see why. The sandwich came out piping hot with a mixtures of mouth watering smells ranging from the bite of the Swiss to the juiciness of the turkey and bacon. The basil pesto was an incredible touch and the avocado added that California club taste to it. I would highly recommend this sandwich the way it comes as it was absolutely divine.  Atmosphere: The restaurant itself was a cool, old school home feel that made the experience that much better. There were students working on papers and research while enjoying the sunshine and coziness of the dining area. While there is not much seating inside, it feels like an escape to a comfortable home that also serves up delicious food. Consensus: The mouth-watering sandwiches and plentiful salads and soups makes this place a definite stop every time I'm in Lincoln Park. The cozy home feeling of the dining area mixed with the great staff adds to the all around wonderful food this place has to offer!",voted for this review,Addison G. and 1 other,javascript:;,Useful,2,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The music playing was nice background music and there was a great eclectic vibe to the cafe.We did make sure to stay in the main room, as while there were more tables in the room next door, it was library level quiet and we were there for catchups so that silence wasn't going to work for us. Luckily we could snag one of the few tables in the main room. Supposedly there is usually tables upstairs but it wasn't open when we were there.Now service could left something to be desired. We all wanted tea, my friend wanted an English Breakfast. I couldn't see this option in the shelves of tea so I took my tea up to the counter and asked if they had English Breakfast, given that's a pretty typical tea. When I asked the woman said they did, but couldn't find it. So I asked if she could recommend which type from those available  would be closest to English Breakfast (there were Irish breakfast, Scottish Breakfast and a couple others). Her response was ""I'm not a tea person"" and couldn't provide any recommendations and her demeanor was just that I was putting her out. I'm not usually one to expect too much knowledge from staff about everything on the menu, but when the sign out front says tea emporium I would assume some tea knowledge from staff. So I just grabbed Scottish Breakfast and hoped it would be ok for my friend.We then waited and waited for 3 teas to be provided (we also got a cookie and brownie but those were handed over immediately). It was surprising that they were using the espresso machine to heat up the tea hot water one cup at a time instead instead of having a kettle or boiling water tap.When we finally got our teas they were fine (provided in paper cups) and the cookie and brownie were great and we had a nice time catching up without feeling rushed.",voted for this review,Michael H. and 1 other,javascript:;,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

As a graduate student, I was looking for a nearby place to get some good coffee and spend a few hours studying and the Bourgeois Pig nailed it! During our time there, we had two lattes, a PSL, and a drip coffee. All were very good, but I do wish they had been in actual mugs rather than to-go cups. Just a personal preference and perhaps they were too busy to have time to bus and wash dishes. I ordered a breakfast panini and my partner the deluxe waffle. The panini had crazy delicious ham and was very tasty and filling, though I see now I was never offered a tomato as promised and it came with the tiniest side of fruit. My partner was a bit disappointed with the ""deluxe""part of her waffle as it was pretty lackluster, but I personally think ordering waffles at a restaurant will never result in satisfaction. I would say stick to the sandwiches here as it seems to be their forte. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering it was a busy Saturday morning. Maybe twenty minutes tops? I also need to mention the baked goods they had to offer looked very good. I plan on trying a scone next visit for sure. While I picked on a few things above, what really gets this place 5 stars is the delicious coffee and the ample space to study in a unique and relaxing environment. Don't be fooled by the small space where you order food and drinks. They have an adorable patio, another space next door, and ANOTHER space upstairs to that. The ambience is great and you can find a bustling spot or a quiet corner with some lovely jazz playing above it all. There is PLENTY of room and if you order food and head next door, the server will come find you to deliver it. Hopefully management will be able to fix what other Yelpers have mentioned regarding wait times and also make sure no shortcuts are taken when it comes to their food and coffee. For now, I stick with my 5 stars and will be back to enjoy the cafe again.",voted for this review,Ricky L.,javascript:;,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

However, the most recent time that I was here, the service was disastrously slow, likely due to a problem with understaffing. One single worker was running the cash register, making the drinks, and bringing the food to the tables. There were about 10-12 people in front of me in line when I arrived, and 15 minutes later, only three of them had been helped. I wouldn't say that I'm an impatient person, but it felt absurd to have to wait that long to put in an order (and with 7 more people to be helped before me, was likely going to take quite a while longer).

I am not kidding. The barista hands it to me with a shrug and says ""we have a very light brew today."" Alright...so I took a sip and it tasted like it looked - like watery milk. I asked the barista to dump it out and add more coffee, thinking he just added WAY too much milk. Nope. That, for whatever reason, is how their coffee looked. I opted for a cup of hot coffee instead (without being offered any kind of refund...lame). It was watery, but at least it was the right color. I wasn't about to try to order a fourth drink. The bathrooms were gross and the staff all had an attitude. There are way better coffee shops around (I recommend NextDoor on Diversey, although it has a really different vibe).",voted for this review,Steven G. and 2 others,javascript:;,Useful,2,Funny,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

They're there two best sellers and both are pretty easy to see why with loaded meat, melted cheese and toppings. Served with a fresh pickle spear on the side it's just perfect for lunch, dinner, or in between studies snack. The atmosphere is incredibly chill and can be perfect either an extended session before finals or a first date with a Tinder swipe.

After ordering, we tried to find a table, but the only empty tables were covered in trash that the workers didn't clear off. The tables were also put so close together that navigating through the place was a nightmare, and the upstairs area (that I saw cute photos of) wasn't open even though it was busy.

Served in a plain white, medium, white paper cup, the drink was unassuming. Getting into the actual drink it was a very smooth dark roast with only a small aftertaste of bitterness. Overall, very drinkable and great for settling in and either getting down to work or fully relaxing on a lazy afternoon. Cafe Review: 'Cafe' is a bit of an understatement here. The bourgeois pig boasts a large location off Lincoln and Fullerton, with ample seating outside in their front courtyard and additional seating upstairs beyond the initial cafe. Note, there is a restaurant in the building but in a separate room/space adjacent so since you can't seamlessly walk through it to the cafe I'll be omitting it from this review. The overall aesthetic is antique, old wood and old world style. This is the kind of spot you'd expect out of a Hemingway novel, with swing music playing like in a Portillo's. The cafe walls are a combination of old exposed brick and an interesting textured siding I am not familiar with. The whole building isn't just for show either; the whole thing is ""Old Chicago"" down to the foundation (built in 1893) as evidenced by its sneaky supply cellar adjacent to the rather old bathroom set up. (Be aware: the entrance does require numerous stone steps, so beware if stairs don't bode well for you). I for one definitely recommend the second floor of the cafe for those looking for a quieter nook to read, work, or have a more intimate, quiet conversation. Overall, the coffee is solid but not the main focus as the atmosphere of the spot is really the key attraction. Think of a university reading room meets a swing era coffee/sandwich spot.

I went today and sat on the top floor, which I didn't realize was a huge seating area! There are tables, booths, and couches. The things that aren't great about this place is that you order on one side and then pick up your drink on another side. However the full drink menu is on the walls in the pick up area. So when I ordered my drink from a paper menu on one side, I wasn't aware of more than half of the drinks because the paper menu had a limited selection.

It's in an adorable house and it's honestly quite nice to sit in there and eat and drink coffee. Nobody bothers you if you just want to sit and read or chat with friends.Their selection is food and drinks is pretty vast.Cons:The service is what's gone really downhill. The time before last that I went, it was fairly busy and I ordered a sandwich and drink. I waited for a good 20 minutes, and went back up to the front to ask about it. I guess they forgot about putting the order in so they started on it as soon as I reminded them. Okay, I understand, they were busy, it happens.The last time I went there I was with my fiance and we ordered some sandwiches. The guy at the front was literally trying to get something out of his nose while we were talking to him. My fiance asked for no avocado on the sandwich and they said it wasn't possible. I thought the reason why they take a good 10 or 15 minutes to make the sandwich was because they were making it fresh? Why can't they just not add an ingredient? I also asked for a iced chai tea, he said they were out. I said ""cool, can you make me some iced tea? Doesn't matter what kind."" He wasn't sure.  So I asked about the loose leaf tea, could he just make loose leaf chai (bc they had loose leaf chai) and then add ice? I brought over the tea to him and explained. He gave me water with ice in it with the tea bag so I ended up drinking iced water with a chai flavor to it. The sandwiches again took about 10 to 15 minutes to make and were Alright but nothing to write home about. Even my fiance who normally loves it there agreed with me that this place has fallen off the cliff. I hope they get better one day, but I understand once you have a nice cushy status in Lincoln Park, you're made. But I doubt I'll go back unless I hear they've gone back to their better days.",voted for this review,Delana T. and 1 other,javascript:;,Useful,2,Funny,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

When you walk up the stairs, sandwiches on the LEFT, coffee/drinks on the RIGHT.  But if you order food and decide to sit upstairs on the right-side, the servers will happily bring your sandwich to you (as I observed).  Sweet.I was very tempted to give this place three stars because really, the space does not accommodate large groups.  They do have a ""designated"" section for group meetings and a sign that tells you to limit your meeting to 60 minutes.  But my goodness, the room is the size of a small pantry.However, I appreciated the uniqueness of Bourgeois Pig and didn't want its lack of space to impact the 4-star rating.  The truth is, if I were to ever come either alone, with 2-3 others MAX and/or attend Depaul in another lifetime, I would be in LOVE with this place.  If I were a college student I think I would spend an unhealthy amount of time here nestled on a claw-footed chair.The interior is so fun and it feels like a vintage shop just happened to turn itself into a cafe.  If you've ever been to the New Elephant Resale Shop of Chicago, just south of Depaul's campus on 1145 Webster, you might know what I mean.  They have vintage Coke signs in French tacked onto their doorways, an extensive selection of teas in a floor-to-ceiling wooden cabinet and just a whirlwind of things to look at and admire (or question).... like in a thrift shop.This cafe has been the one with the most ""character"" so far on the Indie Coffee Passport but then again I still have a lot more cafes to explore in the city.  Happy caffeination! You will enjoy your experience here, just avoid coming in large groups. (Unless you can snag the upper room with two claw-footed sofas and sit four facing four with your cups placed on a studded chest doubling as a table).",1 person voted for this review,,,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

After waiting 5 minutes in line (there were 2 people in front of me), the guy at the register proceeds to walk away as I step up to the counter. Doesn't say ""I'll be with you in a few minutes"" or even acknowledge I'm there. The 3 workers I saw there all seemed to work slowly and without urgency. 3 people behind me left because they couldn't wait that long, and I should've followed their lead. After standing there like I was invisible for 5 more minutes, he doesn't even apologize or say ""Thanks for waiting"" before asking what I want. I knew it was a red flag there, but I was hungry so I still ordered food for my sister and myself. We proceed to sit outside, waiting at least 40 minutes for our food!!  After someone who sat down after us got a sandwich, I feared they had forgotten about our food. I walked up to the counter and asked if our food was coming and said that we had been waiting 40 min. The man asked for my name and said they were really behind. He checked with the cook in the back and said it'd be another 3 minutes. We ended up waiting another 7+ minutes before our food finally came. The man apologized, saying they didn't expect the rush from the marathon, yet he said it as an excuse and without asking if we had everything we needed. Dude, there was NOT that many people there, plus they would've known about the marathon and could've prepared for any extra influx. Suffice to say, the meal was not worth a 50 minute wait. My breakfast bowl and my sister's veggie panini were mediocre. Could've made it better and cheaper ourselves. I asked for no sour cream on mine, which they remembered, but then they forgot to put the avocado on! So, an hour after arriving at this place, I get an incorrect, lackluster meal.

Served with balsamic vinaigrette"" HAD NO POTATOES, hardly any onions, 4 pieces of cucumber, and olives that were 90% pit. 3. GOT MY ORDER WRONG -- I clearly stated I wanted NO CHEESE ON BOTH SANDWICHES --what did I get on them? CHEESE! I said I wanted anchovies in the salad, but on the side. What did I get? NO ANCHOVIES WHATSOEVER! Ever since I discovered AP Restaurants, I've used it quite frequently, and I can say this has been the worst experience I've had, where not one, but 3/4 items I ordered were WRONG. I wanted to try this place bc of the reviews, but I'll never be ordering from here again. They're a place that seems to rest on their laurels, and think it's ok to serve pre-packaged sandwiches, or not pay attention when getting an order. Well, OINK YOU, B.

I like the old house vibe of the inside, which seems very conducive to studying alone or with a group. Indoor seating can be kinda limited, though, which is a downside. The outside accommodations are good, if it's a sunny day in Lincoln Park.On our first visit, my boyfriend got the baked omelette of the day, and it was pretty disappointing. Portion size was small for the price, and the staff forgot his toast. When the toast came, it was dry and didn't come with any butter or jam. I, however, got the Great Gatsby panini and fell in love. Homemade foccacia with pesto sauce, bacon, turkey, avocado, cheese, greens, pressed on the grill?! UM YUM. It was so good, I didn't even feel guilty about not sharing more than a bite.I played it safe and got the same thing the second time I went (so did my boyfriend), but it took forever to get the sandwiches on a seemingly not too busy afternoon.

First they were out of soup.  It's unseasonably cold in Chicago and you are out of soup.  And when asked if they were cooking any more up in their kitchen, the counter girl said yes, but it would be ""hours"" before it would be ready.  So we perused the rest of the menu--they have it up on a chalkboard in such an inconvenient area--to read the whole menu you have to walk the length of the room so you might have to walk in front of people already in line--made for a very confusing parlor game.   They do have paper menus at the register--easier to read and you're not getting in anyone's way. The sandwiches.  My husband and I shared the Son Also Rises (on the menu it's touted as being on 2007 best dish list  from Chicago magazine)  I wish I had that 2007 sandwich because it was not worth the hype they rave about.  The sandwich was missing the alfalfa sprouts and the bread was not the sun dried tomato bread it is listed as having.  So we missed that whole concept.  The other sandwich we shared was the Italian Panini which is basically an Italian sub but on panini bread and toasted.  I don't know what they did, but one piece of bread was a total soggy mushy mess.  Maybe it was a blessing as it was one less carb I ingested?  I dunno but it was real disappointment.

This place has garbage service and is completely understaffed especially considering the busy neighborhood it is situated. We waited in line for 20 minutes because we were on our way to the Lincoln Park Zoo and had heard this place was just great. After finally ordering, we waited another 15 minutes while the barista made drinks for other people. He had evidently forgotten about us and despite looking and seeing us waiting during that time didn't bother to check in. After confronting the barista to ask either for the drink or for our money back, he rolled his eyes said ""yeah I'll make it"", gave my boyfriend the wrong drink, and didn't say anything else.

I'm all for cafes and this place was the most adorable and cozy little cafe I've ever been to. Rustic decor with a calm and comfy ambiance. Their cafe and food area are separated due the original architecture of the building but ask the staff and they will help you to the right place. My friends and I met up here for a quick get together. We got our drinks that were all under $5 btw and went to the upstairs seating area. It was super quite but it was the perfect place to sit and chat. I felt really at home here and I might just make this place my new spot for getting work done. The cafe is tucked away in a little corner on Fullerton, so you gotta keep your eyes peeled for it. My dirty chai was delish and my friend gulped down her hot chocolate in minutes.

I visited on a Sunday night, and it was fairly busy, which is a good sign. I was meeting a friend so I went up to the counter to order before finding a table to wait. I ordered a hummus plate and a dirty chai with almond milk and then they told me there was a 20 minute wait for espresso. No matter how busy it is, a 20 minute wait for coffee is unbelievable. So I went to sit down. 20 minutes pass  by and I get my hummus plate delivered to me. Then my friend meets me and goes up to order. She comes back and tells me that my chai with a shot of espresso had been made, and that she saw it sitting there on the counter getting cold (they have always delivered coffee to where the customer is sitting-- the way my hummus plate was delivered) and she heard the manager walk up to it, ask how long it had been there and then throw it out. Then the girl at the counter told my friend they were out of chai so she came back to me and told me I had to order something different after I had already paid. So we went back up to the counter, and my friend asked to clarify that they don't have any chai left, and the manager then said that they did! The girl at the counter just says, ""oh I thought we were out"". So my friend orders the same thing I did (a dirty chai with almond milk-- which almond milk, by the way, costs extra) and then the manager makes mine with almond milk and hers with regular milk! At that point we were so tired of coming up and getting confused that we just sat down, drank our tea, and left. I don't know if this was a rare occurrence but it was absolutely ridiculous.

The cashier asked me if I wanted light or dark roast. I asked her what the difference was, what kind of dark roast beans.  She just said ""I don't know"".   Trying to help her out I asked ""is it like French Roast""?  She said ""yeah, I don't know...it's Intelligentsia"" I have drank Intelligentsia for years, so I was like, OK whatever.  The cost was about $7 which probably sounds  a bit steep for a drip coffee and a scone, but that was not the biggest problem. The cashier handed me a pile of singles as change, and did not count them.  It just didn't seem right, so I hastily gathered my stuff and found a seat and counted the bills, which were $5 short.  So I got back in line and told her I was shorted.  She said ""well, you walked away, what can I do?""  I guess the burden of proof was on me and the moment was over I have to give her that, i should have been quicker, what can I say.  I went back to my seat and was sitting there trying to work, fuming about my damn $5, when I got the idea to ask her, when her shift was done, if she was over $5, could I come get it.  She said she'd count her drawer for me in a little bit.  After about 20 minutes she comes up to me and says that she was ""only over $1.37"".  Trying to even give her the benefit of the doubt, I asked if she perhaps dropped a $5 under the counter?  She was like ""no I only had singles, I gave you all singles"".  Look reader, I know you don't know me from Adam but I only walked into that place with 2 20s and I had a 20 and 8 singles when all was said and done.  The employee is poorly trained: everyone knows you count the change back to the customer, and she was clearly never taught this. And my situation is why you always count back change to the customer.  The berry scone was fresh and fluffy with lots of berries.  The  coffee was bad, gritty consistency, with a burnt flavor. I think it was just burnt. I really don't think it was Intelligentsia, I have drank it for over 20 years, unless it's just that I never drank it burnt   It was just weird. Anyhow, the menu is formidable, vast. There are a lot of cheesecakes to choose from also. The small sitting area is dark and jam-packed with heavy duty vintage tables and chairs.  The place needs a good dusting, maybe redecorating.  In summary I overpaid for burnt coffee and was shorted $5.  I was so upset that I told myself to wait a few days before posting just to stay objective.  There are a few Starbucks nearby; I recommend using those. I will never set foot in that place again. I you have to eat here, get tea, not coffee and pay with plastic.",2 people voted for this review,,,Useful,2,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

My husband and I came from out of town, so we had little to no context for this shop, but apparently it's a salient place? Our friend and guide told us it was a popular spot in Lincoln Park.We stayed just long enough to drink some coffee and use the bathroom and sit for fifteen minutes enjoying a spot of nice weather. Both the little cafe and the outdoor patio were cute and pleasant. No problems with service. There were people on the patio, but no one in line when we ordered.I had a tasty iced coffee and had a good time relaxing outside. There was some kind of student at a nearby table with a laptop and a copy of Infinite Jest laid out in front of him. I'm guessing he was settled in pretty good. Our stay was short and sweet.

Soups are incredibly salty but don't have a full bodied flavor that soups should have (maybe they cover that by adding a lot of salt).

I imagine they have to cut back somewhere to turn a profit, especially if there are hordes of people taking up table space all day to surf the internet and drink one lowly cup of coffee.

It is first and foremost a café, with the food being secondary. The facility itself is essentially an old house converted into a café on the first floor, with space to study outside on the patio, and upstairs. It is actually a great set-up insofar as its abundant table space, natural lighting, and lack of crowdedness(generally). For food, I've tried both the Beggar's Opera sandwich(one of their self-reported best-sellers), along the Julius Caesar Salad. Homemade basil pesto, grilled chicken breast, swiss cheese, avocado, and spinach on a sandwich? Sign me up. When I got it though the chicken was pretty dry, and there didn't seem to be enough basil pesto compared to the rest of the ingredients to really salvage that. All in all, it wasn't a sandwich that really came together for me. Salad was actually pretty good, though a normal Caesar salad with chicken breast shouldn't be too much to ask for from most any café. 8/10 for the atmosphere and study space. 6/10 for the sandwiches.",Was this review …?,,,Useful,,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
