This place met all the criteria. The vibe was a bit slow, which I needed. The coffee amazing. Service was awesome - the baristas were cool and dressed so cute!

Not my preferred coffee shop to study at, but I live right across the street, so very convenient for me. There are a couple large tables, seating about 10 people at max each. There are two bar seating areas against the windows. A few couches and armchairs. And then a couple tables for two people. On the weekends it can be pretty crowded, so it might be difficult to get a big group in here. Usually, if I'm studying by myself, I can find a place to sit. many of the chairs are wobbly and not the most comfortable. Some of the tables are tall enough to be standing-desk-height, which is great for those who don't like to sit when they work, or would like options.Coffee is fine, tea is good. Sandwiches are ok. I don't think any of the items they serve are extraordinary.Main complaint is that no matter what season, it's always freezing in there. I often have to wear my actual coat from outside in doors. Does not make me the most productive studier when I'm shivering.One good thing is that they have two walls with full windows, so there is a lot of natural light that gets in.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Their coffee is just ok. Spicy cinnamon latte was good. Nutella mocha was good too. I prefer Starbucks Reserve coffee over coffee here, but the atmosphere here is the best.

Thanks to previous yelpers i was very pleased with the moment i walked in the door. The industrial vibe and unique menu were exciting.. i didn't know what i wanted and the 2 gitls behind the counter helped me with some explanations and suggestions. I went with the cold latte with oatmeal milk...because they were out of almond milk. Lucky me because it was decadent, creamy, smooth and rich with flavour and depth...it took me an hour to drink it. Knocked Starbucks out of the park!!  The coffee jousecwas full of energy with computer techies and  couples enjoying a quick conversation before going back to work. Bright blue chairs on the patio with dog bowls of water were inviting. Bathrooms were newly decorated, homey and very clean.

Once I tried it, it became my go-to. It's creamy, smooth, and rich. The sweetness level is actually perfect - you get a little bit of the sweetness from the Nutella, but the coffee and non-sweetened milk balances it out nicely. The cafe always seems full, but I never end up having a hard time finding a seat. This seems to be a favorite study/work spot for a lot of people. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. There are both big and small wooden tables, a couch, and two arm chairs. As other people mentioned previously, the crowd is mixed and there are plenty of outlets.

We stopped by as we needed a quick coffee in the morning. Partner got the cortado with coconut milk and it fell flat. Nothing remarkable. Just basic. I got the Mexican latte with three chili, which I thought was great but slightly too heavy on the cinnamon. I don't think the barista enjoyed her job; she had the most apathetic affect during our brief interaction. When ordering, I neglected to correct her when she said ""Mexican latte with almond milk."" I am unsure where she got the almond milk from because I never asked for the substitution, but it was my fault for not correcting her. I am also unsure if the replacement made the latte feel less rich .. regardless, it was a nice drink but not enough to cause me to return. I would much rather drink Jacques Torres' wicked hot chocolate. Would I recommend? Sure if you're in the neighborhood but there's nothing extraordinary.

It was spacious with tall ceilings and long tables, square tables, round tables, and lounge tables galore.  The coffee itself, excellent. I'm no coffee conniseuer, and I have no idea if the coffee bean came from a single batch, from the Andes and roasted in some 1000 year old roaster handed down from a grandma.

Good place to get some work done or for a meeting but a few things can be done better. The work vibe is very nice, a good level of ambient noise nice big windows with a lot of lighting. Some good armchairs, couches, window bar seats and some tables of varying sizes. There is good table space for a laptop or smt but some of the the tables are pretty small/can get crowded/weirdly shaped so its hard to have a lot of work space. If you come on a weekend I would suggest getting here before 11am or after 3pm as sometimes it can be quite busy and have no seating. And BRING A JACKET if you're going to be here for a bit... it always feels COLD whether its summer or winter. Coffee/Expresso- rich and dark Chai latte- If you like a good strong chai flavored latte, i would recommended. They make all their lattes with pretty designs! There is also always a self serve water station so you can stay hydrated! Food: had the brie sandwich here before but it was quite pricey and there's doesnt seem to be an actual kitchen that makes food. The baked goods like muffins etc are ok. I think it would be a lot better if there would be more food options here. I'd say if you're in the area give this place a shot to do some work, read a book, or enjoy a nice conversation but I would not come here hungry (or cold).",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Free wifi and plenty of seats but somehow always difficult to find somewhere to grab a spot as just about everyone in here seems to be trying to get some work done.Aside from that, definitely a go to spot to grab a cup of joe if I don't feel like making coffee at home. They serve up all the classics from your standard cup of coffee to americanos to lattes and cappuccinos, and even some specialties as I've read some have raved about their nutella mocha. As I recall they serve strictly Metropolis Coffee which is a local Chicago based coffee company. Pretty cool they keep it local and they even carry their whole bean coffee in bags if you'd like to take some for home. In addition, they also serve some assorted baked good and some assorted breakfast and lunch sandwiches if you get hungry. Anyways for the same price as as the big chain coffee shops, why not keep it local? Other than that not much else I got on this one.

Anyhow he couldn't grab that ice using his fingers after several trys so he poured the coffee to another cup with less ice. Then AGAIN dipped his fingers to that new cup to grab ice!

The coffee has such a feisty kick when you drink it due to the cayenne pepper and it makes your whole body warm. It's such a rich and unique depth of overwhelming flavor, definitely a must try!!The patrons all look like younger aged population in the 20s and many were hard at work.

They have a nice long bar with stools to either stand or sit at. I like having both options to keep the writing going! They have extension cords around the place so plenty of outlets to plug into if you have a long enough leash... I mean cord ;)I also love their range of music. I have heard both alt-J and the Beach Boys while here. The volume is just enough to enjoy but not overpowering your focus.I ordered an iced vanilla latte. They have a range of sweeteners for self-service, which I usually will do to avoid over sugary drinks. However they put in just the right amount for me. The espresso is very good. Deep and smooth, and not too acidic.

They have the usual coffee selections and plus some unique special ones written on a small list located next to the register. The shop is very spacious with lots of seats, tables, and even a couch and sofas. This shop would make an excellent study center. I had the mexican mocha with cayenne, mexican cocoa, and lavender vanilla latte. Both mexican drinks had spicy cayenne pepper that is pretty noticeable but not too spicy to be offensive. The spiciness lingers on for minutes even if you stopped after a small sip. The lavender vanilla latte was pretty good but nothing outstanding. I especially love the creamy taste of it. All the drinks had a fair amount of sweetness which is just right for me. Price for the drinks was about 5 bux after tax for a large size, which appears to be 20 ounces, which is fair.The environment is minimalistic and trendy. It reminds me of the apple store with the wooden chairs, wooden tables, and clean design.

Nothing worse than coffee snobs! :)My husband ordered hot chocolate and absolutely loved it. I had a mexican mocha- it definitely had quite the kick to it going down the throat, not really my style. I also tried a vanilla lavender latte, I believe is what it was called, and it didn't have too much flavor. I was hoping to really taste those notes of vanilla & lavender.

The lavender is subtle but noticeable enough - awesome drink. House coffee is great, fresh, bold, and full bodied. One thing I find interesting is that there is only one restroom for the entire store, which is quite large in size, compared to the coffee shops I've visited. I mean one for both genders.

If you are coming to study and not looking for excellent coffee, this is the place for you. If you are a huge coffee fan, I don't know if I would recommend Dollop cafe. There are other places you can find better coffee.I got the iced americano and it was very watered down and did not have much depth of flavor, in my opinion.CUSTOMER SERVICE - 2.5/5The customer service wasn't great. The workers aren't necessarily rude. Rather, they were unpleasant because they seemed annoyed at any request or questions asked. First, they got my order wrong and when I pointed it out, the barista made it seem like she was doing me a favor by remaking my drink. I would say the lack of customer service is the reason I give 3 stars overall.Overall, if you are looking for a cute place to study with decent coffee, I would recommend Dollop. The large glass windows allow for good lighting and atmosphere overall and you will most likely be surrounded by people also studying.
