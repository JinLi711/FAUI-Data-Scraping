Totally unacceptable and I want to make sure that others don't have a similar experience."" He then asked me to describe the person so he could personally address the issue right away. He then connected me with his Operations Director and offer me a gift card. He ended by saying: ""If anything happens again that isn't to your liking no matter how small, please reach out to me directly to this email address."" This is what I call caring. Due to an unfortunate event, I cannot receive the card. Upon informing him, he wrote back again!

GREAT bagels and cream cheese here. They were temporarily out of my usual bagel of choice (they bake throughout the day, so shortages are resolved quickly), so instead I got a piping hot chocolate chip bagel with honey nut cream cheese. Both were delicious, and they give an appropriately generous schmear of cream cheese. My only complaint is that their chai latte, which is tea based (which I prefer!) doesn't taste very much like chai. Maybe their blend is off, but the latte tasted like a London fog rather than a proper chai.

The bacon was soft and crispy at the same time, the egg was tasty, and cheese was cheesy and good, and the bagels used were fantastic as well.This place was fantastic and I would absolutely love to come back on my next trip to Chicago.

There were Large samples of chocolate chip bagels and cream cheese to try while waiting-a sweet taste of what was to come.My go-to on the weekend is always smoked salmon and the Fisherman was a Fantastic sandwich: I chose an everything bagel to accompany the salmon, pickled onions, capers, and tomatoes- crispy, chewy, savory! I couldn't decide between the giardinara or garlic chive cream cheese, so I bought them both :) LOVED them both :) and saved some for later.I also had the Bageler on a jalapeño bagel and it spiced up the fried egg, bacon, muenster cheese, and chipotle mayo perfectly!! It was a true breakfast sandwich (at 12 noon).Even though it was kinda warm out, I had a luscious hot chocolate with whole milk and it was frothy, rich, and velvety--Fab!The Bagelers Coffeehouse was An Excellent way to start my weekend, and I know what I'll be trying next: the sea-salt bagel with strawberry jam and peanut butter....mmmmm",4 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,1,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Not too many capers (a plus for me) and the tomatoes didn't make the sandwich feel soggy. The coffees were fine. Ordered a salted caramel mocha which was VERY sweet and a cafe au lait that was fine.

The staff was super friendly and very genuine. Their latte was smooth and tasted like the almond milk was toasted, which was a nice flavor. I had an everything bagel with cream cheese, and it was worth every calorie! The everything bagel had the perfect ratios of seasonings and was soft, chewy, and warm. The cream cheese was SUPER creamy and flavored perfectly--not too cheesy, not too bland. As far as the vibe of the place goes, it has a homey-feel, is relatively quiet (depending on the customers there), and has a wonderful mellow playlist with some older hits playing in the  background.

The bagel choices were really simple, either a lox or a breakfast bagel and then your basic spreads with bagels. The tea selection was impressive. I normally am not a tea person but their tea latte options got me since I was thinking it'd be like a milk tea. Got the litchi noir latte! It wasn't exactly like a milk tea but twas good. It came unsweetened so I added 3 packets of sugar on the raw and 5 squirts of simple syrup.. the amount of sugar I need to sweeten my drinks kinda scare me.. but #donowregretlater I guess.Friend & I got:Bageler on everything bagelBageler on a croissant (though it came out on a sea salt bagel due to misentering from the cashier)Passionfruit green teaLitchi Noir LatteWould come back for my bagel needs!",1 person voted for this review,Useful,,Funny,,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Honestly, I wasn't too impressed. Instead of fresh onions, they use pickled onions which tasted a little weird with the rest of the meal and the smoked salmon was extremely thick and not too...smoked. I also got a cup of regular black coffee, but ended up throwing the whole thing away because it tasted too burnt? Whatever it was, it wasn't good.

After being fooled too many times and going to the Bagelers late morning on a Sunday (it's also about 30 minutes from my apartment, so it's a trek) to find out that they don't have bagels, I've learned better. Now, I call ahead of time. And to my expectation and dismay, they are out of bagels 95% of the time (or at least the flavors you actually care about. Come on, no one wants a plain or a wheat bagel).It's pretty disappointing that a bagel shop is out of bagels before 12 PM, when they are open till 5 PM...and when the issue is happening so regularly (at least 3 Sundays in a row at one point), shouldn't you have learned to stock more bagels?

I stopped by Saturday morning to try their Fisherman sammich. They didn't offer onion or garlic bagels, which isn't the biggest deal, as I can settle for almost any bagel. I went with a plain. The bagel itself was pretty good, but not as good as I had hoped. I still would take their bagels over NYC Bagel Deli's. For the rest of the sammich, it was alright, but not that memorable. I liked that they changed it up with pickled onions but it didn't quite do it for me. Their homemade spreads and cream cheeses seemed pretty good. I tried their coffee and this was more so disappointing. It tasted pretty weak and not as robust as I would expect for a café.Service was alright. The guy taking my order was friendly and didn't have to wait too long for my order to be ready. Overall, it was fine. I would come on in if I was already in the area.For now and probably for a long time, I will still be yearning for a top notch lox & bagel like that from actual NY.",2 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,1,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Sometimes you just need to indulge in one.. and Bagelers Coffeehouse is just the place to do it. Their bagels really are fresh as they make their own bagels and spreads which is a huge plus because who wants bagels that are shipped from somewhere else.. frozen, thawed and then sold? The selection of coffees is also ample and everything I tasted was delicious. It is a very homey coffee shop with great customer service. My personal favorite was the poppy seed bagel toasted with garlic chive cream cheese which even my picky 5 yr old devoured. Although this place was slightly out of the way for me as I live closer to their satellite location at the Jefferson Park Blue Line EL, it is definitely worth the trip (and the calories)!",2 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,1,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The Bagelers Coffeehouse is that kind of place. When we walked in to join the long line on a Saturday morning, my PIC said, ""This better be good cuz  I don't wait 20 minutes for coffee anywhere"".  Little did she know what she was about to be exposed to!  The counter staff was friendly and helpful to everyone. Smart team behind the counter, too. One person on bagels and cold drinks, one on sammies, another on hot drinks, so serve time is quick. Got her a salted caramel latte, me the bourbon vanilla chai, and a bagel. Wow!  Bagels are excellent...just like those I get in NYC...and better than others I've had in Chicago. When she had her first sip of the salted caramel latte, her eyes rolled back in her head and she moaned, ""oh my god! This is incredible!""...and it was. The housemade salted caramel syrup is buttery and smooth like they melted down high quality caramels and added angel's breath. Lattes are perfectly made and, when ready, announced by the coffee goddess with the beautiful voice. Our second trip was just as good so it wasn't a fluke.

I love their garlic chive cream cheese but their giardinara cream cheese is unique (at least I've never seen it anywhere else) and delicious! It's a tad bit salty, but it's giardinara! Their handmade croissants are wonderful, too - super soft and flaky! I haven't had the sweeter ones, but the butter croissants are great!!",1 person voted for this review,Useful,1,Funny,1,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Being a man of the people, I didn't want to discriminate with my choice of bagel, so I figured the everything bagel would give me just that - a bit of everything. I went with the herb chive cream cheese spread because it's kind of my jam.So anyway, I made my way to a corner booth and awaited my order. Amongst the wafting aromas of bread and coffee the barely audible sounds of indie rock tickled my ear; I began to feel an awakening. As I sipped away on my coffee, staring off into space, recollecting better times, I was interrupted by a faint calling of my name in the distance. My bagel was ready.I unwrapped my bagel like a Christmas package, gently tearing away at the paper with the care of a grandmother who says she's going to reuse it. And there inside laid my prize. Never before had I seen anything so beautiful. The bagel was perfectly toasted, edges just a little black, firm outside, with an inside that was still forgiving.The herb chive cream cheese was delicately lathered between to the two slices of bagel, I wanted to make them spread.After some small talk, it became clear that me and this bagel we're going to be much more than just breakfast counterparts.It's not really my thing to take leftovers home from breakfast, but this hot little bagel was different. I ever so delicately rewrapped her and took her outside with me. She came back to my place and I snuck her into my parents room. I don't know why but I always wanted my first time to be in my parents room.I crawled under my parents blankets and took out the bagel from its wrapper. The bagel and I stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity, my eyes gazing intensely at hers. An unspoken bond, unity developed between me and this incredible bagel. It was then I knew, I was going to **** this bagel. As you might expect, it was logistically difficult, but as they say, ""love finds a way."" So in short, the bagel was totally destroyed, but totally delicious. I decided to eat her as I knew she would have wanted it that way. Again, can't speak highly enough about BCH, just be careful you don't fall in love with one of their bagels, like I did.",14 people voted for this review,Useful,7,Funny,13,Cool,6,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Also there is an AWESOME consignment shop right next door...def swing in there on your way out. So why didn't I give 5/5 stars despite obviously loving it here? Well, they don't have any gluten free options to eat, their hours aren't completely conducive to my selfish desire to do work there until 7/730pm (they close at 5pm and I've been kicked out), and their one and only ""slow flushing"" toilet resulted in a really awkward moment for me (um, a plunger had to get involved).Despite having to introduce myself to their plunger, The Bageler's stole my heart :-)",2 people voted for this review,Useful,1,Funny,2,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Thank God I don't go to this place every morning for a bagel...otherwise I'll be 300 pounds! They are fresh all the time. I love their everything bagel and this is the only place that offers chive and garlic spread. All places have chive and onion but I had never tasted it with garlic until I visited this charming place. Their spreads are house made. Everyone is very friendly and attentive.,Was this review …?,Useful,,Funny,,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
