That alone made me a fan within seconds. It does a brisk business and yet there's always seating to be had. The staff is very nice and accommodating, the space is well-maintained, and the coffee and sandwiches are good, and very fairly priced. The only complaint I had, and it's minor, is the donut. Not that good. Frosting, yes. But the rest of it was a little tasteless. But that's small stuff. Robust is well worth a visit. At least three times a week, I bike down from the North Side to somewhere on the South Side or Western Suburbs for exercise and exploration, then work remotely, so I'll be coming in all fall and winter. This place is a keeper. Pro-tip: It will get a little loud during the bottom of the 3:00 hour when a lot of kids roll in rom one of the local schools. They're fine overall, but they are teenagers, so they're going to be a little loud.

HOLY DELICIOUS! Who knew coffee, almond milk and honey could be so perfect?! I will say, it is a bit pricey at almost $5.50, but as a VERY occasional treat, 100% worth it! While I was there I also (calorically, not monetarily) splurged on an amazing double chocolate cake donut. I had to remind myself that I was in public and need not inhale it. Their drinks and sweets are so on point at Robust. Pro-tip: Between 6am-8am all food is 50%!The only downfall is not everyone that works there is kind or efficient. They typically have one person working cash register (and serving simple black coffee) and one person making all of the other drinks, so if you snoozed, you're losing, because you might be 10th in line even at 7:30am! .... totally worth it though for that honey nut latte and donut :)",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Just why does the music need to be blasted so loud like I'm in an 80's nightclub? Thank goodness I had headphones but I could still hear it. I asked the cashier, with my fingers close together in a pinch gesture could the music be turned down just a teensy bit. She said ""I guess we can turn it down a little. It's probably not as loud in the back."" I explained that I was meeting someone who was already set up in the front. But guess what? I had already thought of that solution but I could STILL hear it back there so that's actually why I asked could they turn it down. I don't understand why the volume had to be SO loud when most people were working or trying to have conversations. And a request, not to turn it off because that would be kinda ridiculous, but to turn it down just a little, was not even honored. I think Atlantic Starr or Evelyn Champagne King was playing just as loud if not louder as I sat there.

Long story:I was driving by this place just after 7am and I wanted a cup of coffee so I tried looking inside and I didn't see anyone, and there was no open sign, so I parked and went in anyways. It was open. So I ordered a large Mocha with an extra shot because their large mochas only come with 2 shots apparently. So I told the barista ""hey you guys should think about getting an open sign, as I just saw someone else drive by slowly looking inside to see if you were open."" Barista replies, ""No I don't think so. Our regular customers know when we are open."" I respond ""it was just a suggestion""Thanks for the pretentiousness, but if you want to run a business then you should make new customers feel welcome. This isn't a social club. If I had gone to Starbucks instead at 7am you would know it was open because there would be so many people.Finally I get the coffee and it tastes like chocolate milk. Even though it's cheaper than Starbucks you have to add enough espresso shots to make it more than Starbucks. Maybe he didn't put my extra shot, or any espresso at all. There was no other people there so that's not an excuse. Maybe business is booming other times, but it wasn't looking so good when I went. I guess the Starbucks at the hospital I work at will do.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Since then, I found out that the advertising for the coffee shake is FALSE. The sign says ""cold brewed coffee, cinnamon, almond milk"". The reality is that they use a coffee mix from a packet that contains tons of sugar, saturated fat, and preservatives. One serving is half the packet, but they put the whole packet in for one shake, meaning the calories START at about 500 just for the mix. The ""cinnamon"" is a syrup, adding more sugar to the drink.At least Starbucks is honest about their ingredients for a comparable drink, the coffee frappucino. And, Starbucks ingredients are better for my health. A coffee shop needs to serve real coffee. There's absolutely no excuse for using a cheap mix.Robust Coffee is lying to customers and lagging behind Starbucks for coffee quality.

I also work in the area, so if the lines aren't very long I love to come in for a hot cup of dark roasted coffee and a pastry to go. It always smells amazing when you walk in. You aren't always greeted with a big smile but the service is always polite and accurate. The menu is just the right size, I hate large menus since I'm so indecisive, but they cover pretty much all the basics from sandwiches to shakes. The place itself always seems to be clean and organized. The environment is mixed, from folks coming in to have a quick business meeting to those just grabbing a snack while they wait for the bus. It's literally a gem for the Woodlawn area. They also have the little stamp cards, so if you frequent often you can get a free drink! Most small cafes don't offer this, but that's a perk that keeps me coming back. I love the 63rd Turkey Club, don't change a thing about it. I haven't been able to enjoy a lot of other options since I'm a busy mom and always on the go, but I can't wait to try their little breakfast bowl. I hate seeing people tear small business apart on Yelp and other reviews sites. Next time try speaking with the owner or manager first before trying to ""hit them where it hurts"". I'm a native of the Hyde Park/Woodlawn area and have worked over here for years, in restaurants, business offices, you name it! Small business owners are more likely to hear your opinion, even if they don't agree they will always hear you out and address any issues you may have. The owner is a very nice guy. :)",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

In the 25 or so times that I've been to Robust, I've tried a LOT of the menu and I have also had a lot of different interactions with different staff. I have not had a particularly consistent experience here, which is why I have held off on a review. I've had some five-star customer service experiences and some two-star customer dr vide experiences. I've had some five-star food and some two-star food. I'm going to focus instead on my overall experience, including the sum of 25 visits to Robust. Overall, Robust is an excellent addition to the Woodlawn community. It's located conveniently right on the corner and it's a meeting place for lifelong residents of the community, as well as University of Chicago staff and students who want to venture a little off the beaten path off campus. Uniform-clad school children can frequently be found here enjoying a snack or beverage after school hours. The diversity of customers at Robust is great and adds to the welcoming atmosphere.The service can be hit or miss. Some of the staff are incredibly kind, patient, and friendly, while others are fairly negligent and inattenive. My orders are messed up maybe 35% of the time, which is not the best. I have had my order forgotten more than a few times. Sometimes, the staff are really apologetic and offer to give me extra flavor or a bigger size to compensate. Sometimes, they barely bat an eyelash. I've tried maybe half of the menu items, including blended drinks like the oreo madness, smoothies like the almond milk, banana, chai, food items like the grilled cheese and hummus platter, the mocha diablo, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread latte, etc. So, why the four-star rating? At the end of the day, I know I can count on Robust to be a cozy haven--a true gem in Woodlawn.

I chalked this up to an ""oops"" and quickly grabbed the simple syrup bottle instead.So when Robust Coffee Lounge comes along and intentionally sells me a ""honey nut latte"", you've caught my attention. And I wasn't sure if it was in a good way, or a bad way.Short answer: in a good way. The honey and rich coffee work together really well, actually, with the flavors complementing each other and not conflicting. The ""nut"" part of the drink (probably almond syrup) was a nice touch, and I think that was what made the whole thing quite sweet. It's an excellent iced coffee, with a rich sweetness.

Perfect place to come for breakfast or lunch or if you're a student it seems like a great place to study or hangout with your friends. I am most definitely coming back here whenever I can. We need more cool cafes in the area and Robust helps! Their menu is pretty diverse too I couldn't figure out what I wanted everything seemed so good, from sweet Oreo waffles to a breakfast bowl and anything in between.

Now see this is bs starts. The cashier goes and ask the (white) manager, owner, whatever he was if he could expect my c-note. He looks at me with this jacked up expression on his face then tells her no. I felt some kind of way about the look he gave me. Then the cashier proceeds to inform me there's a gas station 4 blocks away where I could get change. To make a long story short. I come back and my food is cold, shake melted and I'm hot and pissed off not to mention now I have to wait in line. Moral of the story is, if had been a doctor from up the street at the university with a lab coat on I bet it wouldn't have been a problem. Nowhere in the establishment is it posted that they don't except large bills so how the hell can you not honor my cash. I will never set foot in this place again.

We walked in to get drinks and ice cream and when I saw the menu I told my kids maybe we'd come in one day for breakfast. We stood at the counter and there was a girl making a drink. Her hair was awesome but she glanced at us and said nothing. We stood around.  A guy came from the back and made eye contact, but said nothing. We stood around. The girl came over and stood there silently. No, ""hello, may I help you?"" Nothing. My son wants to know if they have ice cream. ""Floats."" He asks again. I try to explain that from her response I assume they only have vanilla ice cream and some sort of flavors of soda. She remains silent. He asks if they have cookies and cream. She shakes her head. Ok, he'll take a cookie. I ask what the shaken lemonade is. It's lemonade with flavors. Ok. We order a lemonade.  I ask how much the boxed water is (because it's fancy and people like to charge ridiculous prices for fancy stuff) She doesn't answer. Ok. ""So you want a cookie, a lemonade and a boxed water?"" No, I wanted to know how much the water is. $2. No thanks. She fresh squeezed (awesome!) the lemonade for my daughter and hands it to me. We walk out and my daughter spits the lemonade out. It's bitter. Unsweetened. Why not mention that? We go back in for sugar.  Maybe I asked too many questions. Maybe I wanted more because I'd just run 3 miles or maybe it was because I kept seeing this place and saying I was going to stop in. Whatever it was, I wasn't pleased with the service.  I've had a bad week dealing with UPS and Comcast, I want a smile and a hello at the local coffee shop, I guess.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I didn't even eat the second batch because I was so irritated that I drove all the way from the South Loop just to have these either those delicious golden pancakes again OR a golden waffle.

The pumpernickel bread it came on was pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend the sandwich as a whole.I also had a chai latte, which was nice if a little on the bland side as well.

The space doesn't seem to be used in the best way, though I can't put my finger on why it feels this way. There are a number of individual-size tables that are good for people who are there to work on laptops, but many of those are inaccessible to outlets, and the ones by the windows in the front are somehow unappealing -- maybe due to rickety unstable chairs, and maybe just that the tables/area never seems to be clean. That leads me to my second observation, which is that I always get the feeling the surfaces/tables/floor/etc. are kind of dirty.  I'm not at all a clean freak.  But it just doesn't make me want to stay when I usually have to wipe down my table myself before I put my computer down, and there are often pieces of used equal packets, etc. laying around the milk/sugar table. If the coffee were somehow exceptional, neither of these things would matter so much. But the coffee is just average for any Intelligentsia location.  I go to Robust when I have to be on campus immediately afterward, and that's about it.  I know Robust is trying to be this swanky coffee lounge in a neighborhood that hasn't really had that, but if that's the case, the maintenance/upkeep has to be like that of a swanky coffee lounge.",11 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

While the food can be a bit inconsistent at times, overall I've left really satisfied. Coffee is fantastic. Vibes are egalitarian and academic. I'd say this is one of the few places in and around U Chicago that local residents and students genuinely interact. Staff has always been very friendly and accommodating.",1 person voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Needless to say, my hot chocolate or should I say hot milk got cold. I used to love their hot chocolate, but now they add a drop of chocolate sauce for any size and all I have is a cup of milk. I have to go out of my way to get to this place and I am disappointed.
