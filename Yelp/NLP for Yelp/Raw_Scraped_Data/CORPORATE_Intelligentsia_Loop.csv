Of the two I would recommend the ham and cheese pastry. I am a black coffee drinker and had the pour over with what ever beans they were brewing on hand that day.  During that time period it was mainly beans from the South American region. I prefer African beans with more acidity and fruit flavor to the smooth and nuttiness of a Columbian coffee. Coffee as in other locations was good and the staff is friendly and helpful with recommendations. Given I purchased beans both the Peru and Persephone blend.  Can't really recommend these beans. They aren't bad per say but nothing special and was a bit disappointed when I started using these at home.,Was this review …?,Useful,,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

My usual order is a vanilla soy latte, but the cashier recommended me oat milk so I decided to try that instead. Their coffee is SO good. I could definitely tell the difference in quality and the vanilla added the right amount of sweetness. My friend got a hot tea which came in a mini pot and a bowl to pour it in.

I like the industrial feel which didn't diminish the coziness of the shop. There's a large coffee bar, behind which the baristas work their magic. There's a handful of seats available, but it can definitely fill up quick. If you are a fan of Chemex, V60, Siphon, and Cafe Solo, you will be satisfied with Intelligentsia's offerings. They also have espresso, cold brew iced coffee, chai, loose leaf tea, iced tea, matcha latte, and hot chocolate. I had their Chemex and their matcha latte, and both were fantastic. The baristas take great care in crafting the perfect cup for you. I like that for Chemex, they'll give you a cup of the brewed coffee and an additional decanter of extra coffee on a wooden tray.

Highly professional staff and great coffee quality. I ordered the almond cappuccino made from Kunga Maitu, Kenya beans. It has the typical berry/black current flavor of Kenya beans. Overall profile is very well balanced and smooth. It smells woody and nutty with a consistent beauty-berry-sour taste. The finish is bitter and neat.Enjoyed the visit.

This location is a real looker, with marbled counters and tiled floors, and its street side location in the historic Monadnock Building. The baristas are as dapper as can be with their bowties and Newsie's caps. Necessary? No, but it's an aesthetically pleasing touch to this already classy place.We lingered a bit to get charged up for a long visit to the Art Institute, and enjoyed the buzz of the place. The Paris bombings had happened a day or two before, and there was a community feeling with people getting together, discussing current events in French and English, and surprisingly not a lot of people tippy tapping on their computers or tablets. Can't go wrong with any of their drinks. I had a classic chai, which was a warm treat on a windy day. I almost filled my suitcase with bags of beans, but bought just one, their Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, whose light and floral notes make me happy. Would I have to choose just one Intelligentsia location to patronize, this would be it.

It has a mix of seating.. counter space, a couple of small tables and a larger community table. The coffee bar is large. Takes up most of the store. They had 6 people working there, which seems like a lot for a coffee place, but it was super busy there, popular; they actually needed the volume of staff.I got a latte. I asked it for it skim, they only had 2% milk. It was creamy, subtle earth flavor. The espresso almost had no flavor. You can taste the milk and feel the caffeine but the espresso is super soft to taste. I also got a tea cake. It was like a pumpkin muffin with sugar crust and toasted pepitas on top. The difference between the tea cake and a pumpkin muffin was its softness. It was more fluffy than a muffin.. almost like a pumpkin flavored angel food. Delicious.

I came here for 2 consecutive mornings for breakfast since it's less than 50 meters from my airbnb apartment on East Washington Street. Had latte on the first morning and soy chai latte the second day. Both were smooth and not acidic at all. What makes Intelligentsia coffee shines is their pastry from Floriole bakery. I tried a couple and chocolate almond croissant was my favorite. The Pain au chocolate and butter croissant were good too. Besides coffee, they have an impressive list of teas available and wished I have more days in the city to try them. Sparkling tea on tap. How cool is that? The space is beautiful and very hipster. The baristas do dressed up in suit with tie or bow. Don't get too intimidated with their dressing, they are all very friendly and could recommend some blend if you're not familiar or first timer to their coffee.

Intelligentsia is a treat, help yourself to it. The West Coast has Blue Bottle and the Midwest has Intelligentsia. The coffee is always flavorful and so well made with the integrity coffee and the coffee farmers deserve. The staff take their coffee seriously and while they turn over a lot of drinks throughout the day, each drink is tentatively made. They're not so bored of making coffee that they need to purposefully mess up your name to entertain themselves. Every barista makes a proper and flavorful drink every time. This place does get busy but if you're there when the crowd is small, it's a very relaxing place. If you sit at the counter, the baristas pouring drip coffee are always happy to share a conversation.

Is it expensive? Sure. But at least the coffee is worth it. I had the Karyenda Burundi via the Chemex. It was great. Just the right amount of acidity and citrusy notes. I also recommend some of the other varieties they have. They usually do a great job. The shop itself is pretty cool. The whole industrial look with a decent amount of seating for a small shop. The other draw was also the bakery. I had a buckwheat scone with fruit preserves and it just sweet enough but filling. Good stuffMy only complaint is the price. I know it's all about convenience I get that. They make it for you, but I can do a Chemex too. It isn't very hard and getting premium beans is easier than ever. I even do my own roasting so a cup of premo coffee that is over $5 bucks just isn't worth it, frequently.

The Chicago coffee scene is akin to this coffee chain, you can tell just from the widespread availability of this particular coffee brand.My initial plan was to visit the original location, but I was a ways away, so I chose to stop by this location since I was in the immediate area. Luckily, it was a good location and the store set up was awesome.The neon light wall creates a vibrance that adds spunk to an already bustling store. I also like the fact that they have a counter top right by the espresso bar, allowing you to watch the baristas while at work. I dropped in for an espresso paired with a decadent brownie from their pastry counter, and that was the perfect pairing. The chocolatey flavor went well with the robust espresso finish. Intelligentsia was the perfect coffee finish to an already great Chicago trip.

Remember to try - angelo (4 espresso shots) in a sweet ice coffee; coffee flight (somehow not as acidic as general pours); single-origin espresso shots (my honey's fave). Be patient, but if your drink doesn't show up in 10 minutes, ask them about your order. If they forgot, they are truly apologetic and give you your next drink free!

It was during the last 2 weeks of December, the cafe was busy, and there was a barista making multiple pourovers at once - which mine didn't turn out to be all that great and a bit watered down. Pastries were $4 just for a chocolate croissant, and I ended up forking over $10+ including tip for the whole thing.

This particular Intelligentsia was for many years my favorite of all your coffeebars. I went with the flow when you stopped steaming milk for iced lattes b/c of California health code (btw. I'd even sign a waiver for the extra botulism risk. It's a texture thing) and when you changed your chocolate provider from Valrhona to Tcho to Askinosie. I've accepted those changes and even admire others you've made over the years save one: your baristas at this coffee bar have no longer been as consistently anal retentive, and frankly, it's breaking my heart. Please bring back the caliber of obsessive baristas that have captured my devoted drinking attention and $$$$ all these years! Or, if it's the stress of the huge line that is making the baristas cut corners, can you please add meditation or yoga to bring back the coffee zen? My last few visits here my drinks have tasted like Starschmucks. (And no I won't ask for a redo when the line is 15 people deep and the same stressed barista is making the drinks and my friend's drink sucks too. Just make it all better.

How much I love coffee but only when it's really done right. This place was all over Chicago, so naturally I had to try it out. Upon entering it definitely has a snobby hipster vibe. No poor folk walking in this place. My friends and I came in on a busy Friday, especially with this location. Right in downtown near millennium park. The location itself is good, right by buses. metro and easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue. When you walk in the staff barley looks your way or acknowledges you. They are wearing ties? and vests? and half suits? Like seriously, who needs to wear these things to make excellent coffee? I would rather a person who dresses normal who makes me awesome things. I'm not a fancy person by any means but I was a bit thrown off by that.As far as the coffee shop thing goes I was disappointed that as a 'real coffee bar' they did not have skim, fat free or 1 percent milk options. I was told they only had 2 percent or whole milk. I am lactose intolerant so to me this was ridiculous. Especially to a place that is pretty much ruling the market in Chicago. Wake up! Even Starbucks has nonfat milk intelligentista...The beans themselves were quite good, and I suffered with a 2 percent latte just to try it. I was not disappointed by the quality of the coffee at all. Their quality is probably closer to an A then a B, and if I could have it with skim milk it would probably be awesome. Sadly they did not have that option for me. As for returning to this particular coffee shop, I wouldn't. I would probably hit up some of the smaller, local coffee joints that are not as 'business professional' and always have grade A beans and nonfat milk i.e. wormhole or hero coffee bar to name a few.",4 people voted for this review,Useful,4,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The real thing is just like a shot of espresso with a little milk which was great but I felt like I waited half a century while standing awkwardly close to a family the entire time waiting for my drink because it was that crowded.  It was pretty good, but hard for me to really judge a drink that can be downed in 2 seconds.  What I did notice was that the Ethiopian espresso was a lot more subtle in flavor compared to some of the other espresso drinks I've had.  Not sure if that's just the difference in how they make their drinks or the country of where the beans are from.  What do I know? I'm no coffee bean expert.I really want to come back and try their regular black coffee.  Well, nothing in here is ""regular"", so I retract that last statement.  Even their black drip comes on a fancy tray with a ceramic cup and a mini glass carafe of leftover coffee.  I wonder if the employees would have a heart attack if I ordered one and busted out my personal stash of the cheap non-dairy creamers you find at a gas station?  4 stars just because the employees were incredibly nice and took their time making each drink even though the room was crowded more than a sardine can.",4 people voted for this review,Useful,3,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Randolph street. There were a few people ahead of me but the latte came out quickly. The foam art on top was really pretty and the foam stayed in tact -don't know if that is good or bad but the whole latte was smooth and very enjoyable. I also tried a sugar roll type pastry and it was tasty.

The concierge at the hotel I was staying at recommended this place as an early morning pick-me-up before I had to go catch my flights. Plus, it's tucked INSIDE the Monadnock Building, one of the first skyscrapers in Chicago. The shop is located right across from the giant USPS office on Jackson. The decor has a very vintage-y feel to it that made me feel like I was in a cafe car on a train. I also simultaneously felt like I time traveled to the past. All the baristas wore suspenders, which I thought was super cute! The walls are creamy, lit with warm-colored lights, and the fresh flowers in glass jars on the tables definitely added a homey touch, too!I had an iced soy latte and my brother had an iced mocha. Drinks here aren't too strong. The iced mocha was on the chocolate-y side and the soy latte was refreshing without being provoking to say the least. I think I loved the decoration more than the coffee itself.

There are plenty of locations throughout Chicago, but this one is close to The Loop and Millennium Park. Service was friendly and quick by the entire team. We ordered an iced ginger plum tea, a chocolate chip cookie, and a drip coffee. All three items were great (especially the tea). The flavors were all there, and the cookie was dense with just the right amount of chew.

As a specialty coffee professional, I was very pleased with every aspect of our multiple visits to the Millennial Park location in Chicago.The coffee and tea was outstanding. The service was stellar from 8 baristas, though one woman delivered an odd glance that seemed less-than-friendly for an unknown reason. That said, we felt welcomed and valued every minute.I highly suggest this Intelligentsia location, as well as every other.

I would come here when I used to work downtown, but since I don't have a reason to be downtown anymore...ANYWAY, I'm by no means a coffee snob. Don't ask me what region of coffee I prefer...I just know I like it dark and I like it strong and for it to taste good. Most of the time I feel like I'm the only one that doesn't like Starbucks.Speaking of not liking Starbucks, I'm not a fan of specialty coffee drinks like mochas, frappacinos, etc. I just like plain ole' coffee. The wildest I'll get is a Chai latte (Ooo...I know...pretty basic of me). Intelligentsia seriously has the best tasting Iced Chai Latte in all of Chicagoland. It's not too sugary sweet. It's got an awesome amount of SPICE to it and just the right amount of sweetness. I'm drooling just thinking about it.I was there this past Saturday on my way to the Chicago Cultural Center. It wasn't too busy. I had forgotten how hipstery the baristas are. The lady cashier was a little off. She wasn't rude, but she wasn't the friendliest. The Barista that made my drink was way friendlier. My company ordered iced tea and they really enjoyed it. Said it was one of the best iced teas they've had.Some people say Intelligentsia is super pretentious. I never got that vibe from this location nor the one in the Monadnock Building. I just plain ole enjoy Intelligentsia coffee.
