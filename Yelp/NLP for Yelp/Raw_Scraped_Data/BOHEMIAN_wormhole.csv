It was packed when I came in on Saturday morning and the coffee is worth the wait. My friend ordered the koopa troopa drink, which is like a peanut butter cup in liquid form. I was kicking myself for not ordering that while I was waiting for my hand brewed coffee. But for coffee lovers, the rotating selection of brews is excellent here. The baristas know what they are doing, my coffee came out perfect. Surprisingly it was a great temp where I could basically immediately have a sip once my brew was ready. The atmosphere is amazing. I love all the intricate details they have placed throughout from the stained glass Nintendo to the Delorean in the back.

They even have a model size Back to the Future car and a old school Macintosh computer. They have alot of cool signature drinks on their menu. However - keeping with my standard - you have to try their hot black coffee or cold brew to determine if their coffee is on point. I opted for the cold brew since it was a hot summer day. I would have to say I am relatively disappointed. The cold brew fell really flat. No flavor whatsoever and way too much ice. Dissapointing.

I got their vanilla latte last time I was there and it was delicious. I've also gotten their regular coffee and really enjoyed it. They have a good selection of sweet coffee drinks with solid black coffee as well. They have a small selection of baked goods but you can't go wrong with their croissants. The staff are super friendly and the staff is super attentive at keeping the space clean. The space itself is very cool. There's a lot of comfy seating and you could actually play their old 90's games. The controllers were a little old and didn't work quite right but it was still cool to see.

THE Delorean.  ""OUTATIME""  Total replica, only 30-some in the world. Not only that, dude exited same ramp as did I so we ended up in a Walgreen's parking lot - having a chat. He loved it that I showed him my photo of the Wormhole Coffee.  So back to the future...long have I loved this house of coffee, from when I first set eyes on the Delorean (among other retro stuff, especially the Mac) and when I first set lips on this PBKT - a peanut butter mousse, dark chocolate latte. Yeah.  So, indeed no, I have not had any other drink here - not even my regular black coffee.  How can I drink anything else when the PBKT is like drinking a decadent, rich peanut butter and chocolate souffle.  I liken it to a souffle because it's just so perfectly airy and rich. Creamy and delicious, not at all overly-sweetened. And I'm not a latte or ""fru fru"" coffee drink person whatsoever.  I don't even mind that - when I'm sitting on that comfy couch - that I figure out how old I am. It clicks that I'm listening to remakes of what I listened to in college. By the way, nice job, ""Orgy"" on not screwing up ""Blue Monday."" And then, I remind myself that I like the '90s and beyond music too so I'm  not that old after all. Phew. You're young. You're thin! Get a pastry. They have donuts, assorted cookies and a chocolate candy bar maybe even...and one time, I know I got myself a macaron here.  I did!....

The latte art was fantastic, but I could barely taste the coffee or chocolate flavor. It just felt like a mediocre coffee drink from quick vendor, and not necessarily a dedicated coffee shop.

The coffee was good, which is the main reason you'd come to a coffeeshop. However, I was underwhelmed by the baked goods.

The donut was interesting- very, very dense, and not like a donut at all. I tried a muffin as well, but I guess since everything is vegan, they taste different than I'm used to?

I mean, they have an actual DeLorean (the time machine from Back to the Future) inside. It's as if they're actually sending you through time. Meta. It is worth noting that most of Wormhole's patrons (and staff!) are likely born after the 80s. Like I said, nostalgia is a funny thing. You can be nostalgic for a time when you didn't even exist. Not that this applies to me. I'm old and definitely on this earth before the decade came to a close. Anyway, my regular drink order is the ""Cool but Rude."" It's a ginger + curry latte. Sounds insanely weird but is actually subtle and delicious. I've also tried the Peanut Butter Koopa-Troopa. It's not bad but I don't love  peanut butter flavored things. It is a top drink choice for many though. The vanilla bean latte is also popular, but seems like such a plebeian pick. But hey, your choice.

But Wormhole definitely deserves a shoutout. Overall, this place is awesome. I absolutely love the vibe/theme of the cafe which is a nice throwback to the geeky side of the 90s with tons of decorations that really make you want to dig up your old comic books and action figures. My favorite decoration was the lifesize Delorean on the back wall. They even have a cathode ray tv set up with classic Nintendo games in the back and the music is fitted to the theme of the cafe which I thought was a very thoughtful touch. As for drinks, I definitely recommend the Honey Bear Latte which comes with a seasonal honey or the Koopa Troopa which has a nice subtle touch of peanut butter and dark chocolate. But honestly all their drinks are great and they serve extremely smooth coffee drinks -- some of the best in the Chicagoland for sure. Unfortunately, this brings us to why I didn't give the place 5 full stars.  The place is a little bit small for how busy it gets mostly in terms of seating as there are a lot of people who come here to do work/read/chill. Not REALLY a fault of the place but the bigger issue is that the drinks are definitely on the pricier side. Expect to pay about 4.50 for a small latte here. But one does have to keep in mind you are paying for a lovely drink and setting so that definitely makes up for it.",voted for this review,Useful,3,Funny,2,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I came in specifically to try their Koopa Troopa, and was not disappointed. It was busy inside but the line wasn't very long at 4:15pm on a Sunday. It took them less than 5 minutes to make my Koopa Troopa (Peanut Butter Mousse & Dark Chocolate Latte, 8oz/$4.50 + $0.50 Soy Milk, ), which was delicious! I could taste the peanut butter a lot more than the dark chocolate, but I really liked the richness and thick consistency of this latte. However, the soy flavor may have overpowered the dark chocolate flavor, so it may be more prominent with regular milk.

The whole place was covered in 80's decor  and they even had a DeLorean- but this place wasn't all for show, their coffee is just as good!

It was busy but not excessively so. We didn't have an issue finding a place to sit. In fact, it seemed like seats were turning over regularly during the time we were there. Maybe a function of a Saturday night? Customer service was great. The barista working the register was friendly and funny while taking our order and talking to us about the shop. It was a nice change from some of the barista drones I find at other coffee places. My husband ordered the macchiato. He said it was okay but not great. I had a vanilla bean latte, which was really good. There was a strong vanilla flavor that melded well with the espresso. And, in contrast to larger chain coffee shops, the vanilla wasn't cloying or sickeningly sweet. The decor is fun, especially for 80s kids (or people who have an interest in that era). My husband and I loved the old lunch boxes on display and reminiscing about the ones we and our siblings had. The DeLorean is impressive, of course, but I was more enamored of the smaller, nerdy touches -- video game character magnets made out of perler beads, stickers, etc. Also, I found this sign (see photo) on the table near our seats and love the socially conscious way Wormhole is doing business.

This place serves up delicious coffee along with a satisfying serving of 80's nostalgia. While it may not stand out from the outside, it definitely fits in with the ambiance this place exudes, because as soon as you enter, you are transported to a cozy  laid-back cafe with amazing service and decor. When we went, it was a bit crowded and difficult to find seats with a table, yet we obtained a seat at the bar where we watched and conversed with the baristas about other great places in Wicker Park (was it obvious we were tourists?). We ordered a Koopa Troopa and Honey Bear Latte (interesting names!), and they weren't overly sweet, which I enjoyed. The latte art they put is rather ""artistic"" also, which you should be sure to appreciate... Haha.Overall, this place is definitely a must see in the Wicker Park area and is very close to the Damen Blue-Line Stop. Service is friendly and the vibe will make you want to stay and relax for a while.

Last time I was there I had the Cool but Rude, a latte with ginger and curry and it was awesome! They somehow find ways of combining ingredients that no one else thinks of and create espresso masterpieces. Two other musts are the Koopa Troopa (peanut butter latte) and Honey Bear (honey latte). In terms of food, they have some pastries, cereal, and easy to grab and go savory croissants. I was pretty impressed by the ham and cheese croissant - it really hit the spot for a small tie-me-over after work but before dinner. Don't come here expecting a full meal or anything though, that's not their business.Some of the other great perks include ample working space (there are always a few web designers and graphic artists working on their laptops here), free WiFi, an awesome TV/Nintendo/couch setup to play classic games to your hearts desire, and a friggin' DeLorean floating above everything. Yeah that's right, they have a DeLorean. There are also great figurines, posters, a classic mac, and other pieces of geek history strewn around the cafe. There's also a well stocked shop for all your home coffee needs (chemex, pourovers, beans, etc.)Wormhole is definitely part of the heart of what makes Wicker Park cool, and whether stopping by on my way downtown or even driving in from the suburbs just to come here, they've always delivered consistently great coffee and a great experience.",Was this review …?,Useful,,Funny,,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The cafe theme here is extremely hipster and geeky/techy - it's unlike anywhere else I have ever been. Since I didn't grow up in the 80's, I can't say that I used to watch/play all of these things growing up, but it sure felt like I could travel back in time and play video games through their old TV and Nintendo console. All of their furniture is eclectic, different, and mismatched. Their sugar and milk station is set up like an old office desk complete with the original Apple monitor and have plenty of puzzles and board games. The seats were completely full on a Saturday afternoon, but we were able to snag seats on the couch by the TV. Although this place is clearly for doing work or studying, I could also see how it's perfect for friends to lounge and play games too! You can get the best of both worlds here.I was contemplating between the Peanut Koopa Troopa or the Honey Bear latte. When I tried to ask the barista about the sweetness of the drink, and whether it was too rich (since I don't like my drinks extremely sweet), she seemed annoyed that I didn't understand that those are the sweetest options. I decided to get the Honey Bear latte less sweet and of course it was too dull for me. I was able to adjust at the milk station. I wish the barista was more thorough in her description of each drink.My boyfriend opted for a Kemex, which was freshly brewed and presented in a Kemex beaker and additional mug. I liked how the coffee was extremely fresh!

As you'd expect at a good and popular place, seating can be limited and it may take a bit of time to get your drink during busy hours. But if you can sit down, it's a great place to hang out or work on some stuff.I'm sure you can find 30 places that serve better quality coffee if you really wanted to.

Yes the coffee passport is missing in action like Luke Skywalker in Star Wars VII, and the political scene may seem to be the darkest time line now. However, after an already awful week bled into a working weekend, I found myself scheduled to work late shift at work. Thus I warped in wicker Park on late into a Monday morning and finally went to Wormhole, and wound up writing. The cafe itself lends a generous nod to late 80s/early 90s pop culture. An iconic  metal DeLorean body rests above its back wall and various artwork adorns the walls of a similar themes. Various potted plants (mostly desert type) are found spread throughout the cafe, breathe further life and calm into the patrons passing through Wormhole. The lighting inside manages to balance a calming, dimming nature as the more long staying patrons may retreat further into Wormhole. This darker progression blends well with the natural light which indirectly cast through the large front windows facing Southeast toward toward Milwaukee Ave. Seating options offer up the usual low bar window seats, tables and chairs, and a select few comfy couches and chairs in the back.  As for the drinks themselves, Wormhole offers bean based beverages from Halfwit Roasters. Their geeky/alternative aesthetic continues to provide inspiration behind their specialty lattes. I ordered up the Koopa Troopa which was touted as a dark chocolate latte with a  peanut butter mousse. These flavor notes came through, and with them they also brought undertones of toffee and specculous for strong sweet taste that satisfied but managed not to overpower for fizzle out as many hyper sweet frappuccino style drinks tend to do these days. Beyond flavor alone, the Latte was well made with an admirably accessible temperature and partially blended foam on top that showcased the advertised mousse up top but also allowed it to bleed through over time and contribute a pleasant nuttiness to the rest of the drink below.  With so many good coffee offerings in this neighborhood, it's hard to honestly attempt to give them all a fair shot. Despite this and my distance to the spot (being in Roger's Park)  Wormhole is certainly worth initiating your hyper drive for and making the trip out.

Plenty of outlets to charge up your various electronic devices whether doing so at a desk or sinking into a big ol' comfy couch. Bathrooms were pleasantly clean as well. All of the things I look for in a good cafe were present and accounted for.",Was this review …?,Useful,,Funny,,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I came here because I needed to get out of the house and do some work so I was looking for a place that was spacious and had wifi/plugs.  There's definitely a lot of seating (tables and couches) but it was so packed the whole day I'm surprised we found seating near outlets.  They play popular hit songs so I kept thinking I was in a bar - and definitely wanted to go to one afterwards!  I got a chai latte which was good but came out lukewarm. This place is cool but I wasn't a fan of it being soo jammed packed, pretty loud (from all the people and workers dropping stuff), and the drinks were kind of mediocre compared to the surrounding coffee shops in Chicago.  Maybe I'll come back.  Wifi was solid.",2 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,2,Cool,2,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The staff are friendly and the place has tables and couches for studying. The place is usually busy so it might be difficult to find seating. Lots of plugs near the tables to charge up any electronics along with free wifi (password is on little cards on the tables). Ordered an earl grey tea - they give you the tea leaves from the first steep and when you finish your first cup you can go back and get it steeped again for free. Any kind of milk toppers are extra $0.50 (and if you want another milk topper for the second steep it's another $0.50). Standard tea - nothing special or amazing about the tea, but it was served quite hot. Menu selection seems like the standard coffee shop with some snacks. I don't drink coffee, so I noted that selection was limited to non-coffee drinkers (ie: no non coffee based/matcha lattes or tea lattes).One down side is I prefer to study with illumination, and despite being in the cafe in the afternoon it was quite dark. Also, since it's so busy it might be a little noisy to get work done (so bring headphones). As such, I wouldn't really recommend this place to get some work done.

We both ordered caffè mocha and asked for cocoa powder on the surface. I double asked the barista about the latter. He said you got it. All the artistic coffee shops I have been to, make the mocha with espresso, milk and chocolate (and/or cocoa powder). When our mocha came, there was no chocolate or cocoa neither inside or on the surface. It was cold and the taste was more like a latte and bland like old coffee. While drinking that disappointment, my friend and I were checking out some cool Star Wars and gremlins toys in front us. The interior decor is from the 1980's basically and it's so hipster and interestingly geeky. While discussing if one of the gremlin toys looks like Yoda, the barista took that gremlin toy and put it somewhere else like we were about to steal it or something! No sense of humor or a friendly face!. We could not comment anything on that cup of coffee with a unwelcoming face like that. Wormhole wouldn't stand a chance if it was for the coffee. The best thing about them is the location and the interior decor. For the coffee quality, would give less than 2 stars, for the cool vintage hipster design 4 stars and for the service that night 1 stars.

Then this dude came in with his crew (pretty sure he had a few short circuits in his bionic implants) and we got into a tussle that ended up outside. I had to borrow some poor girl's hoverboard and tried to get away but those boards don't work on water! I won't bore you with the details of the rest of my day but it was pretty crazy.Wormhole might as well be called Cafe 80s with its homage to all things 80s, and of course that amazing Delorean.

I am really glad I did because it was an awesome place to study and I ran into an old friend here.I arrived around 3 PM on Labor Day 2014 and it was pretty packed but there were still a few empty spots to grab a seat.I ordered a vanilla latte 8 oz for $4. I sat down at one of the sofa while I waited for my cup of joe to come out. About 5 minutes later, my name was called and I picked it up and also got the wifi password from the floppy disk at the front of the store.I migrated to the bar area where the baristas were making their coffee. The seating here was a bit uncomfy, especially for a short person because the stools were so tall that but my feet were dangling and there was no back rest to the stool. My back started hurting from hunching and I kept getting distracted because I was admiring the skills of the baristas making the drinks. And not to mention, it is a bit loud. About an hour after, I migrated to the table that is shared by 6 people. It is a bit crowded but enough elbow room for all of us to be on our laptop. This is where the outlets are too for people who need to charge their phones/laptops. This was where I got most of my work done.Overall, I really like the theme of this coffee shop. It has a video game theme on top of the 80s music they kept playing. I loved it! The coffee was delicious, too and very reasonably priced!I would definitely come back to study here or catch up with a friend. They have a lot of cool stuff around the store that I wanna check out next time I come back, like the old school video game console, the small section of quirky gift ideas, and the cool car in the back of the store.",voted for this review,Useful,4,Funny,,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

This place screams 80's and hipsters, but still has that local neighborhood feel even with its growing popularity. And rightfully so. Any place that brews their own coffee that they grind, then make individually and also sell fresh on site is worth my time. I had the vanilla bean latte which was seriously amazing if not life changing. If I moved to Chicago I would live off Damen so I could be close to here. This is seriously how I want to start my day everyday.The ambiance is very mixed of locals, business people, students, hipsters, 80's kids and the like. Come early or wait for the line to go away like I did, because we got the couches in the front and didn't even wait for our coffee. We also bought t shirts for this place because not only were they awesome but also on recycled materials. How can you not love that?If you are a TMNT fan, BTTF fan or love 80's this place will knock your socks off. I will let that be the surprise! The decor is awesome to photograph or just be around if you can find a seat. For a place so small, they do fit a lot of people sitting so if you hangout you can probably get a seat. Overall absolutely loved this place, the quality, the prices were fair, decor was awesome, staff was amusing and ambiance is worth the trip.

HALFWIT COFFEE.I first heard about Wormhole from a barista @ Gaslight Coffee Roasters in Logan Square. Don't tell anyone, but I got a decaf coffee there and loved it. Came to find out that they actually get it from here and Wormhole brews up Halfwit. Seriously, it's a mean cup of decaf. If one has to drink decaf, it should be this one. When I finally made it over to Wicker Park, I figured I'd try something new and pick up a bag of the 'Moonbat Blend.' I split the bag w/ my brother; kind of wish I didn't. I did a medium grind and cold-brewed  for 12+ hours at home. Dude, best cold-brew EVER. Flavor is rich and full-bodied. Tastes good as a traditional french press as well. If you're in town, you'd be a fool to pass this up. Head down to Wormhole in Wicker Park and pick up a bag of Halfwit coffee! It's the best.As far as the coffeeshop experience, two thumbs up. The place is decorated with cool nerdastic gear: old video games, a macintosh, and star wars collectibles. They have bar seating with plenty of natural light--nice view of Milwaukee for people watching--outdoor seating and some couches/chairs indoors. They have a pretty creative drink menu other than the standard lattes and macchiatos. I'm guessing it changes from time to time. My friend & I picked up a Honey Bear Latte & a 'Cool but Rude' Ginger/Curry Latte. It was the business. 'Spicy' but not played out like a chai. Nice & creamy microfoam. Generally, I have to ask places to cut out the sweetness but here I don't have to. They get that sugar is not a main flavor component in their crafted beverages.",7 people voted for this review,Useful,6,Funny,6,Cool,5,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

So far I've maintained this tradition in San Francisco, Sacramento, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Diego, and I can still confidently say that Wormhole stays high on my list of favorites. First off, the cafe decor is absolutely unique. I can't believe that they have one of those old dinosaur-aged Apple Mac computers! The cute little cafe keeps things interesting while you're waiting for your drink.Like all my favorite cafes, The Wormhole also has a variety of vegan pastries. During my first visit I had their cinnamon roll, which was delicious. The second time I came, they were closing so all pastries were free. FREE. FREE FOOD. The baristas were all super chill, polite, and patient, and encouraged us to take whatever we wanted. I literally died and came back to life on vegan pastry island. I was so happy. And I didn't even get to the coffee yet, which I'm sure you can tell by now was phenomenal. I like my coffee strong, and the baristas definitely attended to that. I did order a small however, which I felt was a bit smaller than other cappuccinos I've ordered, but it was worth it. Oh Wormhole, why do you have to be 2,000 miles away from me?

I usually go for the cold brew (definitely on the acidic side, if you're into that) and an iced vanilla latte when I want to splurge. I'm no coffee expert so I won't say anything about the espresso, but I do think the vanilla latte is deliciously creamy and appropriately sweetened.I really like their music choices - the baristas have eclectic tastes, ranging from Drake (Jumpman Jumpman Jumpman), to Weezer, to 80s pop. If you're working, there aren't many outlets at the bar, and unless you get a table early, the seats closest to the outlets are already occupied. If you've got a long charging cable for your laptop, you might have to apologetically navigate around people to plug it in. The two (gender neutral) single user bathrooms are kept nice and clean.

With a monolith tv console found in the back and a stack of Nintendo games like Paperboy and Contra beckoning beneath an actual Back to the Future styled Delorean (complete with upturned tires) the atmosphere preserves the warm fuzzy nostalgia of the 80s. The latte I had hit the spot on a chilly day and the baristas are pretty open and friendly. There is less pretentiousness here than other places. I took home a 12 oz of Guatemala coffee beans from a local roaster, Halfwit, which wasn't too bad brewed black. I figure I might have let the coffee sit too long before the pour which made it taste slightly bitter.

I don't live close but occasionally will take a special trip out to sit and absorb the heavy hipster vibe. There's nothing about me that fits in but I strongly connect to the 80s nostalgia. The drip or chemex coffee is perfect. The staff always seems sweet and even gregarious. Truly love this shop.

On top of it all, much of the seating is A) on sofa chairs - really difficult to write anything on a chair B) shared seating at a large table - ugh, for a person who prefers not to be crammed next to unknown, anonymous people, this is a nightmare and C) at the bar/against the wall stools - the depth of the table which is way too narrow. Then on top of all THAT, apparently the last I checked, the only iced tea option was the scarlet iced tea which straight up tastes like medicine.

Love:The decor. The kitschy. The nerdy. The science fiction-y. The 80's stuff. The videogames. I love ALL of that. The pictures on the walls. The nerdy apparel for sale. The nerdy names of drinks. I love that about Wormhole. It makes me smile and will definitely keep me returning. Heck, there's even the Delorean from Back to the Future.Latte art. Their art is on point here. I enjoyed immensely the aesthetic of all of the drinks I have ordered here. This adds a flourish of fun and sophistication. In my mind, it also justifies leaving a bit of a tip to my barrista, too. Meh:Peanut butter Koopa Troopa. I read a lot about this drink and it didn't blow me away like I had hoped it would. I was expecting something sweeter, I think. Maybe you can chalk it up to the fact that I'm not a big coffee drinker. Perhaps I just don't know any better. It certainly wasn't bad--just nothing special or particularly appealing for me. Seating. Good luck finding a seat here, let alone an outlet. Cross your fingers that your laptop has good battery life if you want to get work done. People who have a coveted outlet tend to hang out for a while (they know a good thing when they see it). Generally, if you hang around a bit awkwardly, a place to sit will open up. The times I've been here and the barrista asked ""for here or to go,"" he raised his eyebrows slightly when I said ""for here."" Clearly even the barristas know it's often unreasonable to find a seat. Music. It's a little bit loud for my tastes. The barristas are also pretty lively and loud, which could be disturbing if you're there to do work. Overall, The Wormhole is a fun spot to have a drink, but I wouldn't choose it as a place to camp out for the day to get work done. The scarcity of outlets and the general din don't lend themselves to productivity. That being said, this spot sits at a solid four stars for me. The nerdy 80's theme is just too appealing not to fall in love a little bit. This is a place I would especially recommend to similarly nerd-minded friends, especially if you're in Wicker Park!",7 people voted for this review,Useful,6,Funny,2,Cool,3,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

In Chicago, it was the Wormhole. Now, you need to understand that I am a Starbucks-style coffee drinker through and through. I'm talking pumps upon pumps of flavor syrup, sugar, milk -- the works. I joke that Michael Scott from The Office (who once drank just cream and sugar) and I have similar opinions on what makes good coffee. My partner, on the other hand, enjoys straight, black coffee. Needless to say, it's somewhat rare when we can find a coffee shop that meets both of our flavor preferences.Enter the Wormhole!I'm not sure what my partner ordered, but I know he enjoyed whatever roast they had recently brewed. For goodness sake, he has a t-shirt from this place, so obviously he enjoys their stuff. I tried their Homemade Vanilla Bean latte which was DELICIOUS. This was probably the best latte I have ever had, and even my black coffee, old-man partner enjoyed it -- and he's not into the super sweet stuff.Not only do they have excellent coffee, they also have some cool 80s memorabilia and swag. My partner was especially floored by the Ghostbusters desk reference. We didn't get to stay and work, read, sit, or really hang out, but it seemed like a great place to do all of the above. There's a mixture of seating and it wasn't loud at all -- probably a great place to park it for an afternoon or catch up with a friend.",voted for this review,Useful,,Funny,,Cool,2,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I'd climb my way into that shell of a Delorean and kick the crap out of the fake flux capacitor, like Dorothy with her ruby shoes, wishing more than anything I'd be thrown into a future at least 100 years from now where hopefully the economy was better, and perhaps intriguing men stopped thinking it was cool to keep several different girlfriends at one time. Who am I kidding? Both will never happen.I just stopped in for some tea and the staff was polite but super strange. I'm not sure if they just thought I was strange, or if they were just the kinds of people who don't really know how to throw themselves into customer service. Tea only comes in an unusually small to go cup, and even though they have larger cups, they will make no exceptions. They have ""fancy tea"" or tea that you can tell was actually at one time a plant. They bag the plants before dropping it into the hot water, which adds to the authenticity factor of the tea. What I don't understand is why this process took forever. Even when I was handed my drink, it was with reluctance. It seemed to be hard for them to communicate. Then the guy instructed me to wait a little before drinking the tea to allow it to brew in the water. Anyway, mad props to the fact that this is probably one of the few non-asian places that sell jasmine tea, which is my favorite. I will be back for this alone. I agree with the other Yelpers though. The customers who hang out here seem to have no soul, and are completely fixed on whatever they are working on with their laptops. It's a little unnerving because you wonder if any of them are possibly making plans to take over the world or hack into significant computer systems belonging to companies which help run the world. Who knows. Kind of a sketchy lot for being dressed up like hipsters. There's no talking in here. When you walk in, it's like a scratched record and everyone glares at you at the same time.

Maybe even more time then I spend at home. That said, here's my list of pros and cons:Positives:-Cool retro vibe and decor-Vintage Nintendo games in the back-Lots of outlets-Fun pastries from Fritz (some are vegan, FYI)-Outdoor seating in the summer-Knowledgable baristas who know what they are doing-Open later than most cafes in the area (until 11)-Free, fast, reliable wifi-Frequent buyer punch card that gets you your 11th drink for free-Great location on Milwaukee Ave. in between the Damen and Division Blue Line stations near all the Wicker Park actionNeutral:-Unique music selection (ranging from indie rock, to 80s pop, to 90s rap): It used to be pretty flawless and I'd always have my phone out to identify the songs. However, recently it hasn't been...umm...to my taste.-Creative drinks with funny names: They are not the best drinks you are going to have anywhere in the city, though most are really good. I would highly recommend the Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa! Seasonal drinks in particular tend to be hit or miss.Negatives:-Limited seating for how popular it is, especially near the outlets.

Maybe it was because it was a Saturday afternoon, but the Wormhole was jammed full of coffee lovers and the line to order was almost out the door. From the length of the line and the amazing Yelp reviews, I knew the coffee here would be worth the wait.I ordered the Honey Bear latte (housemade latte + honey), which seems to be one of the most popular orders here, and it was divine. The slight hint of sweetness from the honey made the latte so smooth! I was seriously tempted to order another one after I finished. The ambiance and interior design are definitely on the hipster side, which is a change from what you might get at some of the other coffee shops in Wicker Park, such as Buzz Killer Espresso or Intelligentsia. I'm not sure if this would be a great place to study or have a quiet conversation, especially on a Saturday afternoon, but if you're in the neighborhood craving a caffeinated pick-me-up, definitely give this place a try!!",1 person voted for this review,Useful,1,Funny,,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in spacetime,"" says Sir Wikipedia. The bleakness of October weighed down on Chicago like a ton of worms. Which happened to be my location. Wicker park, Milwaukee Ave. to be precise. I almost missed it but out of the corner of my eye I saw a sign that said The Wormhole. Innocently, not knowing the forces that lay within, I pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside. Immediately and with a surprising lack of commotion, I was transferred back to the 80s. I never got to experience the 80s because I was born in the 90s. Until now of course.The 80s turned out to be a lot like I would have expected. This was a time when Ghostbusters, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Calvin and Hobbes were popular. You could play video games with the original Nintendo on TVs with rabbit ears. Back to the Future was new and popular. That meant that DeLoreans were also popular. The original Apple Macintosh was a cutting edge piece of equipment. And apparently it was highly popular to eat cold cereal in public. All of this and more can be seen in a visit to the 80s. Perhaps the most surprising thing was that somehow good coffee existed back then. Before my time warp experience I was on a Chicago caffeine crawl and this turned out to be stop the third. Somehow they managed to suck a Synesso back through their wormhole. They use Halfwit coffee. Surely that company wasn't going way back in the 80s. Which brings me to a new question. How does the coffee retain its freshness and consistency traveling back and forth through time like that? When I stepped out the door back into current time, was my pour-over which was brewed in the 80s, then 30 years old? If so, I'm happy to announce that 30 year old coffee can be amazingly delicious. An unexpected trip to the 80s could really mess up my plans. But that was not to be so. All I had to do was step back through the door and I would be transferred via an Einstein-Rosen Bridge back to the present. I did so and continued my journey into the gloom that was present day Chicago.",3 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,1,Cool,2,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

There are also some cafe's where you just want to put your earphones in and not talk to anyone, but here, I really enjoyed their playlist plus I didn't mind that someone wanted to strike up a conversation despite the work I had to do. Super comfy and the staff were really friendly. I got their 12 oz Vanilla bean late for $4.50 which I thought was pretty reasonable. It was really good too. I sat there for a few hours and got a little hungry so I got a ham and cheese croissant. I didn't enjoy the croissant as much as I liked the coffee though.

My friend recommended trying Wormhole in Wicker Park.We arrived around 5 p.m and all the couches and chairs were occupied. People were doing all sorts of things from practicing calligraphy, reading, studying, or pretending to study but really browsing through facebook. How cozy was the thought that came into my head. The figurines, calvin and hobbes comics, action figure posters, and the car in the back of the store gave us the familiar and nostalgic feeling of childhood and geekiness. If you are a geek in any way, you will appreciate this place!I ordered a Vanilla bean latte and my friend ordered hot chocolate. The drinks took a while but they were excellent. We settled ourselves in comfy couches and I joyfully read through calvin and hobbes while sipping on my latte. Having permission to be a dork in a public gave me the greatest happiness. Although I hate to, I have to knock off one star because it's not the most private place. Due to its popularity, you often have to share a table with a stranger. I know that this is okay for most people, but sometimes it's uncomfortable to share conversation over tea when you know someone can listen in on it.  Bring your laptop, a book, a hobby, and a nice friend!

Oh, and I must mention the coffee. Mocha, cocoa, honey bear, citrus, and vanilla beannnnn...(please sing in Lucky Charms tune). But really, this place is where the magic happens - people watching, talking, working (ew), sipping, slurping, and maybe even some chugging (yes, the coffee is that dang good).I squirmed my way into Wormhole on a Sunday evening and I couldn't be more in love with it now. It's definitely my favorite coffee shop in Chicago. I'm actually not a regular coffee drinker (cue shock), but when I do drink coffee, it better not be bitter like some other coffee made by a green ""regal"" lady. Wormhole uses amazing Halfwit Coffee, and mannn does it hit the spot. Their drinks are absolutely delicious. I do love me some regulars - cappuccino, mocha, lattes, but their specialty drinks are particularly delicious. And if you don't like that strong stuff (in the alcohol world, the equivalent of Everclear), then their specialty drinks are mmm, mmm, good (think of Smirnoff Ice. C'mon men, you know it's delish). My favorite specialty drink is the Honey Bear Latte, but I've heard great things about the Peanut Butter Chocolate.But that's not all lovers and friends, Wormhole and Fritz Pastry 'bout to do it again. Yup, that's right - they sell Fritz pastries. And though I literally live 4 blocks away from Fritz itself, there's something about pairing these delicious pastries with Wormhole's amazing coffee. I would definitely recommend getting a pastry, cookie, cupcake, or any of that sugary magicalness. My personal favorite is the chocolate chip cookie with pretzels on it.

I even heard that it was supposedly the best cafe in Chicago. I came here very eagerly to try the supposed ""best cafe in Chicago"" as well as pick up some HalfWit.The cashier was a bit snooty. The place wasn't unusually busy and it wasn't at an unreasonable time (4:30 pm) so I don't know what that was about. In fact, the whole place gave off a strange, buy-and-get-the-hell-out kind of vibe, which is unusual from everything I've read. I got the Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa (I normally get a cappuccino but I figured, why not do something different.) I didn't see pourovers on the menu but I did see chemexes on the merch table. (Strange how the more pretentious cafes don't do pourovers. When you brew coffee with a kettle, THAT earns you the right to be a dingleberry.) I also got some Kenya Alimu HalfWit, which I'm excited to try in my Chemex.My girlfriend got the Chai, which came fresh from a powder. My Koopa was one of the tastiest things I've ever gotten from a coffee shop.Due to the powdered Chai and strange vibe, I gotta knock off a star. I'm definitely willing to return though.EDIT: the GM messaged me and went into detail about how there are, indeed, pourovers; I thought they didn't do them, so that was my mistake. He was a friendly guy who cares about his shop, so I'm bumping this review up to five stars. Especially since the Halfwit Kenya Alimu beans I bought were really, really good.

I won't lie; the baristas are cute and sometimes chatty. Vanilla latte and honey bear latte are popular and soothing choices. The banana-pudding flavored ""Cosby"" was a surprisingly mellow winter drink. The ""cool but rude"" with spices and curry powder can be kind of too sweet but you can always ask them to make any drink with less sugar. The coffee is strong but *do not buy the cascara coffee-cherry tea* that they sell in the bags. It's about $10 and you will be disappointed. It tasted nothing like coffee nor tea, but like wine. In the summer they have an iced drink called ""rocket sauce"" that's a combination of ginger, lemon and mate.

However, while their coffee and pastries have remained solid and their baristas are friendly, it gets so crowded/ busy at times that my sipping-coffee-and-reading-a-book-Sundays are increasingly difficult to enjoy.

The girl who worked at the counter assured both are permanent items so I'll have to go back to try the other.While sipping, I see the baristas weigh their coffee beans. Is that how they  ensure precision for each cup? Coffee nerds rejoice! I could be wrong, I don't know, they just might be doing something else, but man, it is good.Hoping they'll continue to make other interesting creations. I missed out on my chance in South Korea to sample the Mozzerella Latte and Sweet Potato.

At any given night you can be shoulder to shoulder with a couple on a first date, a local catching up on some reading, or a student (me) frantically trying to finish a 15 pg paper before a looming deadline. It has the kind of unique decor that seamlessly blends together cool, kitschy, and comfortable.  There are plenty of seating but expect none of them to be too forgiving on your bum and a lot of people  that are forced to sit on chairs end up placing their drinks and plates on the floor. Errrrrr, food on the floor? I don't know about that. The ambience of the place makes up for most of the shortcomings though.And the drinks! Reasonably priced and (the ones I've had) really satisfying. They have a ""Top Five Players"" list consisting of what I'm assuming is their most popular drinks: homemade vanilla bean, honey bear latte, peanut butter koopa troopa, cool but rude, and smoke signals. All good and worth trying (and all below $5) but I'm finding it hard to really say anything else about them. Not unique enough, I guess? Solid nonetheless. A well-deserved four stars for the friendly/quick service, the 80's decor complete with Calvin + Hobbes art in the restrooms, and overall ambience. Oh!

I feel like Wormhole has an identity issue. It wants to be hipster hangout/artisan coffee joint/1980s nostalgia market. It's confusing, the feng shui is off kilter and I don't even fully understand feng shui, I just know when it's off. Pick an identity and run with it. Here's my unsolicited advice: if you are going to have 80s memorabilia, then at least display the nicely maintained pieces, not the smurf and gremlins who look like they went to all night binger and fell in the sewer. I went there to study and get my SF Ritual coffee fix. Apparently, Ritual was just a visiting roaster and they are gone now. Insert sad face on this San Franciscan. Coffee good. Get it to go.

Absolutely madly in love with The Wormhole. It is my new favorite coffee shop! Everything about it is fantastic! If you love the 80s. you, too, will fall deep in love with The Wormhole.I've been wanting to go here for awhile and when I finally did I was anxious to see what an 80s coffee shop would be like and was kind of expecting to be let down. From the second I walked in and saw the DeLorean and all the cool 80s decor, I knew things were going to be good. It is a very hipster type of shop, it's in Wicker Park afterall, but the workers are amazing. Hipsters I'm sure, but the non pretentious type which is always refreshing. I went on their one year anniversary so I actually got a free cupcake! Awesome! And the cupcake was delicious.I'm having a hard time remembering exactly what type of coffee I got but I know it had something orange flavored in it. It was fantastic and they did that fancy schmancy coffee artwork in it. Love it!After getting our coffees and cupcakes, we sat on the couch right in front of the TV. I had the same type of big ol' TV in my house growing up so that was fun. And we started playing Nintendo! I think I impressed my friend with my Super Mario 3 skills. Little did he know that I am a master of Super Mario 1 and 3 in Nintendo and I totally owned him. I had no idea they had Nintendo in the shop so that was a huge bonus! Plus they had tons of games! I could have sat there for hours hogging the Nintendo! Suggestion...add a second couch/nintendo area so I don't feel so bad about playing for an hour straight while jealous onlookers eyeball me.Then the music. Ah yes, the music is amazing! I heard some Journey, Elton John, and a lot of the 80s classics. I absolutely love 80s music and would have loved to hear a little more of the less known 80s musics...maybe just some popular songs instead of just the mega hits! Either way, it was totally amazing and I was annoying my friend greatly by singing along to everything.As I said, I'm totally in love with The Wormhole!

They care about their environmental impact and it shows! From a green standpoint:Positives: The shop offers mugs and glassware to all of their dine-in customers. Their to-go cups are made by a green company that relies on post consumer materials for production. They have recycling in shop, and have all of their drink add-ins (milk and sugar, etc.) in large refillable containers instead of the packaged single serving options. For their napkins, they have recycled paper, which is way more responsible than using virgin paper products. Their baked goods are not wrapped in plastic, which is how a lot of coffee shops keep their pastries, and they serve all food on washable plates with silverware. Negatives: There are those days that you go into the cafe and do see the majority of patrons with disposable cups... not sure if it is a specific employee who prefers it, but it would be great if it happened less. All and all, wormhole is a great example of how a company can keep their carbon footprint small and be responsible in their impact on the community.",2 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

So, HA.. But anyways, why I put that quote up there? Because once you get inside, you are taken to a time in which you do not remember, if you are the ""average age"" of a hipster, which is the customer base this coffee shop appeals to. Most of the coffee and mocha and latte and etc. are served in small portions, however, it is more than enough to feel ""full"" after you finish it. I end up ordering whichever pastry is available on the glass counter next to where you pay. And it is worth getting, if you want something along with your drink. The appeal of this coffee shop is how it has memorabilia from the 80s, things that give out memories of pop culture from that decade. Note that this shop is small, every time I enter it is almost at full-capacity, but that is because of its popularity. As well as there are bar stools that are quite okay, but for me they are uncomfortable since these are probably meant for tall people, I just sit on it anyways. So no complaints. Summary: i definitely recommend, since I tend to appreciate small and local businesses whenever I can,  since Starbucks and the like does become boring if you go there a lot.",1 person voted for this review,Useful,,Funny,1,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

They take their coffee making very seriously. The pastries are on the pricey side and only taste average. Wormhole has a good selection of coffee related products for sale, such as gooseneck kettles, tea diffusers, etc. Even though Wormhole is located in Wicker Park, which is teeming with hipsters everywhere, I can usually find a place to sit when I go which has been at different times during the weekday and weekend.",2 people voted for this review,Useful,1,Funny,1,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I admit I'm not a big coffee drinker unfortunately - not because I don't enjoy it but I pretty much am guaranteed an upset stomach when I drink it. Their menu was tempting though - specialty lattes like honey bear and peanut butter chocolate wooed me in, along with the mainstays. But I spotted the hot cocoa and felt safe with that.And the mark of a sophisticated coffee spot is not just when they pour the milk in art shaped le1aves or designs on their lattes, but when they do the same thing on their hot chocolate! My hot cocoa came with latte art - yes, they literally won me over with their latte art heart. I'll post a picture later.I liked my hot cocoa so much I just needed to try a sip of the coffee too because that was their specialty. I risked an upset stomach and had a sip of my friend's vanilla latte - it was delicious - complexly balanced and also donned a pretty topping.

Wormhole was basically first date, pt. 2. The dinner was a more serious setting, so it felt perfect to come to more fun, laid-back place where we both felt completely at ease. I thought the nerdy 80's centric theme of everything was really cool. The Delorean was clearly the standout, which is mentioned in most reviews here (and rightly so). I definitely nerded out a bit, which is probably for the best, because I didn't scare my date away. Heh. We had some trouble finding a place to sit. At ~8:30 PM on a weekday evening it was really packed with hipsters and their various iDevices. We were lucky enough to get a spot on a couch near a bunch of nerdy comic books, so we enjoyed reading those long after The atmosphere is fairly loud, so we had some trouble carrying on a conversation. It seems a little weird to me that the music is pretty loud because it seemed like the vast majority of people there were there to get work done (not to play video games, which are available toward the back, or read comics, like us). That being said, this place is near and dear to my heart.

While filter Cafe was closed for two weeks I had to go to wormhole, as it was basically the only Cafe that was open late (past 7 pm when I get off work). I've been there about 10 times.Almost every time you go in about 90-95% of people are quietly studying/working. When I was there, there were about 50 people in the cafe and only 4 werent working quietly. However the staff INSIST upon blasting music at a ridiculous level. If everyone is just here to work, for whose benefit are you playing music abnoxiously loud, other than your own??Every time I come in this is the case. I wear Bose noise cancelling headphones and have my volume up to 80% on a heavy noise ""blizzard"" track on repeat to block noise. However I can still hear mystikals ""shake ya ass"" blaring loud and clear the whole way through. I had asked a staff member once if they could  turn down the music and they looked at me for a while then said ...sure.. They turned the music down about 5% and before I had returned to my seat they turned it back up. When I asked a second time and pointed out nearly everyone was quietly studying, she did the same thing. When I sat back down she was whispering to get coworker who was looking at me and started laughing.The staff here have an outwardly snide attitude towards customers. They smile at you while they turn their iPad asking for a tip, but then glare at you if you leave your coffee on the bar for more than a minute when it's ready (because you have to crank the volume on your iPhone to cancel their music).I would only come to this place as a last resort..

From the proudly displayed Delorian, to the eclectic (and surprisingly large) collection of Gizmo stuffed animals (seriously, where did they get all the Gremlins?), it seems a quirky place to enjoy a cup of coffee. One look at the menu (a drink that boasts fruity pebbles syrup!) and a glance at the pastry case (a donut topped with cereal!) seems to seal the deal. Sadly, that's where the fun ends. After reading the description for the 'Bedrock' (espresso, cereal milk, with Fruity Pebbles syrup over ice), I knew I had to have it. I ordered it with a smile (because how can one NOT smile when ordering a drink called 'Bedrock'), which was not only NOT reciprocated by the guy behind the counter, but which I'm pretty sure was shot down by the daggers his eyes were throwing my way. I mean, not that I'm expecting to become best friends with the guy taking my coffee order, but at the very least, I feel like he should somewhat embody the happy atmosphere. And just in case the guy was having a bad day, I visited a second time - same results. On a good note -- they serve French Macarons, which were quite tasty! The 'sprinkle' variety was a fun departure from the more traditional flavors, and the pistachio (though oddly bright green) was delicious.All in all, I do enjoy their coffee and treats - but try to make it a grab-and-go type of operation.",7 people voted for this review,Useful,5,Funny,5,Cool,3,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Complete with Calvin and Hobbes books, classic Nintendo on a tube TV. The Delorean is awesome (it even has Mr Fusion) and the walls and coasters are full of pixelated NES/SNES goodness, vintage posters and a flux capacitor. Its everything that a 30 something misses about his childhood plus coffee. They also have some awesome T-shirts. How could I not buy my wife Boba Fett as a kitten t-shirt and buy myself a tiled pixelated 8-bit map of the cafe in Zelda/Final Fantasy 1 style graphics!?As for the vibe, I want to start by saying I'm not a ""hipster"" as some people reviewing this place are calling the clientele and staff. I'm just am adult nerd who enjoys music and classic gaming. I have no tatoos, vintage clothes, beard or anything else associated with that label. The staff here has always been super nice to me and never made me feel unwelcome. In fact, everyone in Wicker Park has always been very civil and freindly. I really don't understand all the derision and negativity so many people have about it.I have been here two times and the experience was a bit different both times. The first, on a Sunday night. The staff was nice and freindly, but the clientele were all folks firmly ensconced in their laptops and headphones, there was some droning music that sort of made the whole place feel kind of dark and erie. We felt like we were intruding on a private space by having a normal-volume conversation. We got a few sideways looks from those who were obviously annoyed by our presence. No one said anything, no one glared, but we obviously were kind of disrupting the vibe. The staff however was very nice and the coffees were amazing. I had a conversation with one of the workers about identifying all the 8-bit characters on the wall (he was impressed I recognized Ed). Overall, we felt like those there were tolerant of us, but that it wasn't a place to have a conversation. Clearly, its a great place to come to work on your laptop, read a book or just chill. The layout of where the TV is makes it hard to get to the video games as usually the couch seats are taken by someone on a laptop already. We had to wait about 30 minutes to get in there and play. Later, I returned with my wife on a Tuesday night. The place was lively and more like a normal coffee house environment, the music was indie electronic fare and some 90s rock. The staff was joking with us and smiling and we could talk at a normal volume without disturbing anyone. we were able to get over to the TV this time and play some Dr Mario and TMNT on the old NES. Although we felt slightly self-concious with some spectators watching our game, the couches were super comfy and we had a fun time. The honey bear latte and the peanut butter koopa troopa were amazing.",3 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,,Cool,2,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Can't think of anything more quintessentially hip in a neighborhood that is fast losing that title.

The space itself is fun and inviting and definitely a good mix of people typing away, others chatting about nothing, others people watching, and everything in between.Good pastries here as well!More important, the service here is great. People here don't act stuck up like your average hipster, they are pretty welcoming and the staff runs the joint like a well-oiled machine.Only reason I give it four stars and not five is that the prices are a TAD high but nothing out of the ordinary with any other high caliber coffee shop.

I do, though, strongly recommend that you not base your opinions of places purely on anyone's yelp review. Yelp is full of babies and I am one of them.  I crawl my whiny morning baby self into the Wormhole several days a week. I'm often the first customer of the day and they are facing a customer who cannot speak before caffeine.  I  merely grunt and point to muffins in cases and cappuccino sizes on boards. They accept my mumbles and determine my needs. I nestle into a bar seat and await the perfect single cappuccino, served in a baby blue cup and saucer with a side of tiny cookie bears. YES. BEARS!Then I get another one to go...because its just so very good. And because they care, EVERY MORNING, that it tastes amazing. Because they know its important to me. It starts my day. Much is made of the whimsy of the décor and the retro vibe. That's all great and really, it is quite charming but the thing that makes me loyal is that they are truly passionate about coffee. There are times when the coffee has made me cry. Because its so very lovely.

Having had to sleep next to a hot water heater that was incredibly loud, I would say that this is not as loud as that. Not even close.

Cool decorations too--- vintage car mounted on the wall, old school lunch boxes, and other random decor.QUALITY coffee, this is not Starbucks kidz. With the higher quality comes a slightly higher price tag (8 oz. honey bear latte $4, 8 oz. specialty drinks $4.25). Nonetheless, the latte was divineee and the corn blueberry muffin was a NOM BOMB.

I had an appointment in the area before a conference call for work. I came here based on the positive reviews. As I was paying my order, another customer asked them to turn down the music a notch. I was so thankful for the request, but I didn't notice much of a difference in volume. I took a seat closer to the door, as the sound seemed a little less obnoxious. Thankfully, I was only on an internal call where I could listen on mute most of the time. I still missed some key takeaways from the call due to the noise. So don't come here looking for a quiet place to work or take a call.The peanut butter koopa troopa was very good and different from your usual coffee drink, and it was topped with a beautiful leaf design, so I would give the drink 4 stars. Just take it to go next time.   I would have happily ordered something from the pastry case, but nothing really appealed to me. The chocolate chip pretzel cookie looked over baked and hard.

Obviously the fun decor lends itself to a perky atmosphere, and the coffee is delicious. I'd recommend the honey bear latte, it's absolutely superb. They also have a bottomless coffee option if you're staying for a while. At the counter, they have some standard pastries. Every food item I've tried has been good but not overly impressive. The baristas have always been super nice, and definitely not standoffish or overly arrogant in a ""hipster"" way. They're very welcoming, as are most of the customers you run into here. I don't think anybody would feel uncomfortable. Also, there's two bathrooms, and they're usually very clean. As for the study/work situation, if you're a person who needs quiet or a calm atmosphere, this is not the place for you. The music is too loud to drown out with headphones, and there's always tons people moving and talking and just generally being social.

Been coming here almost every week for the past 2 years. This place is definitely a great place to catch up on some reading or studying. I'm sure there are plenty of meetups at this place due to the high volume of customers. Seriously, this place always gets packed after 3pm and don't even mention Sundays when everyone is prepping for their upcoming school week. There are two long tables that seat 6 people, two couches which seat about an extra 6-8 people, 2 extra chairs, and about 5 stools next to the counter where the coffee magic happens. The baristas here are all down-to-earth and friendly. The interior is filled with movie and video game memorabilia. There's a Nintendo in the back. The drinks hit the spot every single time and they're all reasonably priced. Their most popular drinks are all priced between $4-$4.50. I only wish Wormhole invested in more comfortable furniture and chairs to sit in. Some of the couches feel as if you're being sucked right into them.

It combines the richness and crema-laced ecstasy of a great cup of latte with the texture and savoriness of chunky peanut butter, all while only hinting at a bit of sweetness -- oh my /Takei.The ambiance:Hipster. Nintendo with Super Mario Brothers 3. Space Invaders everywhere. Trendy bears and mustaches; flannel/plaid; and very dapper hairstyles. Everywhere. Expect a lot of artists/writers showcasing their works in progress here.The drinks/food:I already prefaced with this, but their Koopa Troopa is amazing. I'm a big fan of combining sweet and savory, especially in drinks. The balance of flavor hits a high note the same way the Maple Bacon Latte at Pirate Cat Radio (in San Francisco, CA) does. Don't hate it 'til you try it.In terms of food, I've only had their Lemon Macaron (at $1, it's a steal). It wasn't fresh--the exterior was a little styrofoamy and stale, but the flavor was there. It was like a great lemon wafer filling. It's many steps down from other LA/California-based macaron purveyors (Lette and Bouchon Bakery come to mind), but those are priced 3x+ more than these $1 bad boys.The service:A little slow, but you're here for quality (assuming you're here for coffee and not just to be part of the hep crowd).This place is one of the reasons why I considered living in Wicker Park (that was a short 5 minutes, though).",17 people voted for this review,Useful,12,Funny,13,Cool,14,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Chai is the only thing I order nowadays, so I pretty much use it to determine whether I will return to an establishment or not, and my final verdict is that if you want a trendy place to hang with your friends and wax poetic about the pre-Internet 1980s (I lived through the Reagan years - not my favorite decade!) then this is your place, but the chai just wasn't that great in my opinion, pricey for the size, and the service still leaves a lot to be desired.

(single tear)Kinda everything that you'd want a coffeeshop to be in 2014. 1. Theme'd to the max. I'm frankly amazed at some of the corny sci-fi, star wars, and old nintendo (including an 8bit system you can play in the back!) stuff they have in there. The huge tile picture of all kinds of 8bit Nintendo game characters is incredible.2. Typical staff.They're just nice enough to not be rude, but aren't really too nice, either. They take themselves just seriously enough to borderline too serious, but not too serious. Read it again and think about it, it makes sense.3. Hilarious patrons.Macbooks, everywhere. Overflowing with 'artists,' who cannot stop talking about themselves.4. Good Drinks. The only way they make you decaf is as an Americano, b/c obv, nobody orders that stuff. Their specialty coffee drinks have great names and taste great as well.5. Sweet things to eat.(Mostly vegan, duh)6. The most incredible internet passwords ever.The only bad part is the lack of seating, most of the time. But, that's not bad for them. Just me. And I'm OK with that.

It's true. I kid you not, within 2 days of my inaugural visit to Wormhole I heard the infamous ""Rocketsauce"" praised THREE separate times. THREE. I mean, really? From different social circles, random people, a colleague and a Facebook post. The universe demands I right my ways. Next stop, Rocketsauce on the menu. Noted. It's some concoction of fresh lime juice, tea and other magical things. I will find out more later. As for my journey...it was pretty much a dream come true start to finish. A quick Yelp app search for ""coffee that doesn't suck"" (ok, ""coffee"") near Mojo Spa in WP led me here, and also it's been on my caffeine radar for quite some time. Bonus: their note claiming ""plenty of outlets and free wifi, come stay awhile."" Um, hell yeah. I hate the iffy feeling of not knowing when a place is worker bee friendly. Major props to Wormhole for walking the fine winner of: hip urban outpost working station with power, internets, coffee, and ROCKETSAUCE. Oh, and a nice mix of folks...hipsters, of course, but also a friendly all-accepting vibe. Hard to do. I digress. Many heeded the call this particular Friday so the house was a bit packed. Ain't no thang, I jumped up to the bar near the espresso machine, hammered out an hour or so of work while sipping a wonderfully chilled iced coffee and was on my way. Actually bounced on my way, that stuff was stacked. See reviews for the bangin' 80's decor and flashbacks. The Deloreon is a sincere touch, and despite its girth is geekboy and geekgirl eyecandy indeed. Nintendo!? Why was this a work day!? I would've rocked that shit 'til close if given the chance. Great coffee. Great service. And, I'd def come back for that pre 9am Mocha Puffs bowl (free with beverage!). Wow, these guys are just hitting it out of the park. I can get on board, most definitely.

Yes, that dates me but its sooooo worth it. Upon first glance, I was instantly transported. Let's be clear... THEY HAVE A DELOREAN. The caps were necessary. UN. real. So the Delorean is on the right hand side and the left is populated with 80s lunchboxes, mogwais, free bumper stickers, general hilarity. We grabbed a cuppa and head over to the couch. We sank into the couch, grabbed an Original NES Controller and busted out with some of my fave game - Bubble Bobble! Meanwhile, my friend nestled a stuffed ET between us which immediately made for photo opps galore. We were surrounded by various iconic movie posters -- princess bride, goonies, star wars (natch) and enjoyed a rousing game while people worked away on their lappies.You must stop in here. It's rad, nifty, gnarly, groovy, fab, tubular. Whatever 80s accolade you'd like to bust out.

Left disappointed. Don't waste your time here! I was less than impressed with the staff, the coffee, and the overall atmosphere. STAFF & COFFEE: I'm a coffee and tea lover who loves exploring and discovering awesome new coffeehouses, I asked for some café basics (i.e. London fog, café miele) and was met with, ""Uhh, I don't know what that is..""  ""...um... I don't think we have the stuff to make those.."" and ""yeah, umm all our drinks are on the menu"" So, bummed over their lack of barista basics, I went with a basic drip pour--and was not a fan of the quality or brew.  Hear me out when I say - the barista's here don't know coffee.  Unless you want one of their kitschy, sugary signature drinks, don't bother getting anything to drink here. ATMOSPHERE:  The atmosphere here is...eclectic... but not an eclectic I could jive with. They had an interesting choice of music - too boisterous for me I couldn't study or have any kind of real conversations because I felt distracted by the blasting loud rap/pop music. Also--while I would never consider myself a neat-freak, it's a dirty, grimy place. The dim lighting hides some of that though. Overall, if you you're looking for a chill place with good coffee in Chicago--don't waste your time here. There are so many wonderful places to get coffee in this city.

On the one hand, I really like the Wormhole. The coffee is good, they have creative drinks, and a really cool-looking space. BUT there are some small drawbacks too: First, you're paying a serious premium for location, the DeLorean hanging on the wall, and the high-end coffee. This stuff ain't the cheapest caffeine in town, but most of that you can chalk up to ""you get what you pay for."" Second, it's not a great place to hang out and work. A little too loud. A little too crowded. But if you're just looking for a drink and a place to talk with someone, Wormhole is the place.Third, I recently had my first (mildly) unpleasant experience there...I bike down Milwaukee on my way to work every morning, and finally decided to stop in to take advantage of Wormhole's Yelp! announcement: ""Cyclists!  We wanna hang on your commute.  With you!  Bring your helmet in & any amount of drip coffee you desire is on us.  Before 9:00am!""  I had them fill up my Thermos and bought a home-made pop-tart to assuage any lingering guilt for the free coffee. BUT they charged me $1.00 for the coffee. When I asked about it, they said that they only give out smalls as part of the commuter deal, and, because my Thermos was bigger, they charged me. Listen, this isn't a huge deal, it's still a discount, but don't say ""any amount of drip coffee you desire is on us"" if it isn't.I will say that the staff has been pleasant during my prior visits, so I'm trying not to let this (minor) annoyance color my overall perception of the place. I will probably stop back in with out-of-town guests so they can gawk at the kitschy (in a good way) decor, but from now on I'm not gonna bother getting off my bike on my way to work.***UPDATED***: 1. Thanks for your response, Travis. I appreciate it. It's such a kind response, in fact, that I'm not entirely sure whether it's heartfelt or sarcastic (totally joking). I know that my 34-ounce Thermos (which is an amazing product, btw: ) is massive, and when I do stop in again on my way to work I will bring a different, more reasonably sized vessel.  2. I changed the review to reflect the $1 charge (originally said $1.50) and also upped the rating because of your message.  Like I sad above, I really do like Wormhole, and your quick reply only helped that.

You'll see the baristas literally writing lab protocols for water temp, brew time, weight of grounds, etc. for new beans they bring into the shop (which I think is weekly). It may be a little extravagant, but if want a great espresso drink, you want them to pull it for you. If you want a 900 calorie sweet roll, Travis is your go-to guy.I do want to comment on this anti-hipsterism and yuppie thing. I know I'm probably not as sensitive about fitting in as some commenters may be. I can certainly understand feeling intimidated around people who look differently. 20 years after being a ""hipster,"" I'm probably a ""yuppie."" These are both terrible things to be. I hated wearing dirty worn-out clothes and being covered in ugly tattoos, but it was fun to sneer at those effete wine-drinking yuppie snobs when they had to gall to sit in my coffee shop. Now I hate having to shop at Barney's and use a Macbook. You cannot believe how uncomfortable this Range Rover's seats are. I guess it's nice to have grown up and be entitled to sneer at the hipster kiddies who don't appreciate a good coffee drink as much as I do, even though we're both in the same coffee shop.Etc.",5 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,3,Cool,2,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I know that's the most talked about thing and yet it's the least important thing when wanting a cup of coffee, but still. Think about it.  This coffee shop has a fucking DELOREAN inside of it!  Pretty cool.  Moving on...Giancarla and I met up with Kiera (of Schuba's bartending fame) and I ordered a Chai tea latte with vanilla.  Awesome.  They make their own vanilla at Wormhole so you should definitely try a vanilla latte, as Giancarla did, and loved.  They boast some of the best baristas in Chicago and all bragging rights are reserved.  Don't expect to grab a quick cup and be out the door, because these folks take their time making you a drink with deliberation you can taste.  Kiera opted for the vanilla-less Americano and still felt it superior to most.  We all split a scone and enjoyed that as well, but it's a scone; no biggie.Sondre joined us later with Mona, Kyrre, and Åse (of Norway's film, real estate, and rhetoric fame, respectively).  Sondre got the ""Rocket Juice""  comprised of Iced Yerba Mate with ginger syrup and lime.  ""Refreshing and a delight.""  Kyrre and Åse joined him on that order while Kyrre added  "" [He] liked it very much as well, but had to add lots of sugar to sweeten things up.""  He gave it  a 6.5 while contributing the highest score to the company. *ahem*  agreed.  Åse believed it to be an 8.  She also adds, ""it was fresh, cooling, and energizing.""Mona went with a Soy latte and was pleased by the heavy steaming.  In her words, ""Excellent, not too bitter, the soy milk was steamed into a perfectly creamy texture that is rarely found in an iced latte.""  I can tell you, she's just as picky with her lattes as she is with her men, so this is a high compliment.The Wormhole has a spacious interior, but on summer days it's nice to sit outside on the sidewalk.  Definitely a great place; one worth re-visiting!!~Dave ""Herremannen"" Heilman",3 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,1,Cool,2,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Ok--- so I walked up to order my regular-- grande skinny vanilla latte w/an extra shot of espresso.  The cashier was kind of thrown off and didn't have the best personable skills but she was nerdy and fun so I was good. :) Overall a good experience with semi-cute nerds.  We got to play Mario on the couch and enjoy a cheap drink.

It was a calvin hobbes themed bathroom. How freakin cool is that? I really appreciated wormhole for it.

So, I'll be PC for this one:I asked for a soy macchiato. Not a cappuccino. Very nicely, I asked the barista to make my macchiato with more foam, I like foam...instead of saying, ""sure!"" She said, ""okay...just so you know, next time order a cappuccino, just for future reference."" Now, she didn't know it but I've worked off and on in the coffee industry for seven years. So, naturally I responded, ""oh...okay. A macchiato is two shots of espresso and foam though, right?"" ""It is but we do a free pour here so. Just order a cappuccino next time.""I couldn't handle that. A sufficient, ""sure I can do that"" would have been great. So, me being me, I proceeded with, ""I guess seven years of coffee experience means nothing..."" Her response? ""No, maybe not. Starbucks?"" ""No.""So, my point here is when I ask for a macchiato, I think I know what I want, and I don't think it's the job of the barista to tell me otherwise UNLESS I'm actually wrong. What I should have told her in regards to her suggestion that I get a cappuccino, ""I don't want a cappuccino, and I don't want a cortado"". After all, if you're free pouring steamed/frothed milk, without discarding the actual liquid, you're making a cortado, and a macchiato is two shots with a dollop of foam.--UPDATE--The owner of this business and the barista I complained about responded to my review. I really appreciate that effort, as it shows that the owner cares. It was still a disappointing experience, but I do think their responding made up for it a little bit.

Let me describe my experience. Friendly girl takes one order before mine, then mine (two pour overs) and then I sit down. And wait. And wait. And wait. The guy in front of me gets his peanut butter something latte. And I wait. And then the person behind me gets their latte. And then they decide to call their coworker off of a couch in the back to start my drinks. At this point it has been about five minutes. I say about because I only decided to start a timer about three minutes in. This gentleman takes his sweet time getting everything set up. He then proceeds to make one of the two coffees. In the middle of making the first I watched him blow his nose and not wash his hands. Then he starts on the second. So the average v60 taking 3-4 minutes means on top of the initial wait I have to wait 8 minutes for my two coffees. It took so long that one of the other patrons expressed concern for my dog who was patiently waiting outside for me. I used to go to wormhole while I was in law school before their facelift. I have only been a few times since then and every experience has been the same...last time it took ~7 minutes for my friends Americano. There was one other person in the shop. He let the shot die in its cup for over a minute and then finally poured hot water on top. This is just unacceptable from a third wave coffee shop. And seriously, wash your hands if you are going to blow your nose. That is just disgusting.",2 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Also my wife always complains her drinks are too strong or burnt tasting, even the peanut butter mocha which I thought she would love.

The future he referred to was 2015, where flying cars are the norm and everyone still looks like they're in the '80s.Come 2014, I don't see this wonderful-sounding future without roads, but I do see Wormhole, a beacon of hope in cloudy present-day Chicago, dense with a Starbucks and pretentious coffee roaster on every hip block. Wormhole does not follow the road. It avoids it, flies over it with it's dorkifying 80s theme and the ability to make a great coffee beverage from the right beans and the oddest of ingredients.Let's start with the vibe. There are 80s geek culture references all over the place. Even if you aren't a geek you'll still appreciate it. From Gremlins to Nintendo, I loved every bit of it, but my 7 year old past self freaked out when I saw the 80s replica of the Emperor's Imperial Shuttle from Return of the Jedi. So it gets pretty geeky.And my, is that a real Delorean that has been fitted to look like the one from Back to the Future?!Now to the coffee-- the place appears to be a flagship coffee shop for HalfWit Coffee, which is a local Chicago roaster that doesn't take itself too seriously. Despite this, the stuff is very bold, very tasty, and overall very awesome. I would suggest trying the drip coffee if you really want to savor the flavor of the coffee, otherwise, go straight to the specialty menu. The Koopa Troopa is my favorite-- made with real peanut butter, you may be think about the consistency or the risk of getting a cavity immediately. However, don't. The coffee and peanut butter somehow mix together perfectly. It's amazing.My second favorite was a past seasonal, the Cosby Classic, which tasted exactly like banana-pudding. Just the way Bill likes it. I think the new seasonal is a curry latte, which is as interesting as it sounds. None of these sugary or savory flavors overpower the coffee either-- everything is balanced out very well.Seriously fly here as fast as you can. It's the future of coffee rooted in an 8-bit past.",Was this review …?,Useful,,Funny,,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I basically survive on their coffee and cornbread berry muffins.

CHAI. EVER.Stopped in here after a loooong walk. We were looking for a cafe with character, a place that evoked the same vibe as our favorite college hangout, with weird art, friendly but eccentric baristas, and solid coffee drinks.Wormhole didn't disappoint. Yes, as other reviewers have noted, it is full of the Wicker Park Hipsters (less intimidating than the Williamsburg species, which I encounter frequently in my current Brooklyn neighborhood). In fact, the hipster next to us was kind enough to interject his restaurant opinions, allowing me to stare into his piercing blue eyes* while he did so.But I digress. The chai tea I ordered was the single best chai I've ever had. And I've drunk chai in ~10 countries, on 3 continents. So....you should probably try it. Most chai teas fall into either the sweet camp OR spicy camp, disappointing those in the other camp. This one straddles the line between the two perfectly. The barista topped it off with a beautiful milky-foam flower, and this Seattle girl appreciates coffee art.Only complaint about Wormhole: not enough seating.-*My boyfriend noticed the eyes, too.

Instead of sitting outside in the heat for our 30 minute wait we scooted over to  Wormhole for a pre-brunch coffee, and I'm so glad we did. I loved the place immediately. All of the little pieces of decor kept bringing back old memories of being a child in the 80s - especially the Perler Bead art.Instead of my usual Americano I decided to go froofy and got some honey latte that had a fun name; I was intrigued by it because they used local honey in it, which makes me warm & fuzzy inside. It was really good, I enjoyed every sip of it. The only downer was the wait for our drinks. But that means two positive things to me: people like the place, and they don't rush making drinks.Plus, not only do they have good coffee & service (most important) but I sat on a comfy couch getting my ass kicked at Dr. Mario while enjoying my drink; not a bad way to start a morning. I was very excited to go back the next morning, but circumstances kept me from my coffee.

The atmosphere/clientele is definitely the classic wicker park ""hipster""/yupster scene. The decor is 80s and has some interesting artwork on the walls. It's extremely chill and perfect for reading, working, or studying (though I was here on a Wednesday evening, so could be different other times). The music selection is also really good (an essential for a good coffee shop). The coffee itself is good, but not amazing. I tend to go for variations of different south american blends (colombian, brazilian, etc.) but this is definitely more along the lines of lattes, americanos, cortados, etc. - with a few specials like (iced or hot) vanilla bean.The only major downside for me was the service - it wouldn't be Wicker Park without a dash of elitism. I was greeted with a weird sense of entitlement and condescending demeanor, including getting asked: ""Do you know what that [my coffee drink] is?"".

There is a DeLorean in the back, as you can see in the photo, as well as multiple smaller scale DeLoreans around on counters and shelves and such.  Mogwais, Smurfs(or is it Smurves?) various old-school lunchboxes transport me to a time when we didn't wear seat belts and cell phones came with it's own backpack they were so huge.  I really like this place, I like the tea selection and the inventive coffee drinks.  The one thing I don't like?  There's an employee here who seems to either be extremely unhappy with his job or I remind him of some ghoulish figure from a nightmare of his, or maybe he hates the world?  Or maybe he's had some kind of medical mishap that froze his face expressionless save for the contemptuous look in his eyes for those damned ""paying customers"".  I honestly don't know.  He did put a pretty kick ass leaf into my Koopa Troopa though, so thanks for that.  But maybe smile a little?  Unless you physically can't, I don't think there's no reason to be a bit cheery if you work in a place that could possibly put a happy start or ending to hundreds of people's days.So other than the coffee and tea, they do have cookies and other pastries, along with those crazily priced Macarons.  For some reason my wife loves to buy these.  I think they taste good and all and they are darned delicate, and I'm sure they're not easy to make, but I just feel a little like someones laughing when I buy a cookie the size of my thumb for a dollar or sometimes more.  If you come here I recommend the Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa, that is, as long as you aren't allergic to nuts.  I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER, so this drink is right up my alley, and isn't too chunky with the peanut love as with other peanut butter based coffee drinks I've had at other places.  It's a little like Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch, Cocoa Crispies and Coffee blended together.  This makes Wormhole worth the trip.  One thing I didn't agree with, the Bedrock, which is Fruity Pebble syrup with cereal milk and espresso over ice.  The drink is $3.75, and is advertised as 7 ounces,  I'm not sure if that's the actual fluid volume of the drink or if that is the size of the cup.  And it was a good drink; slight fruit sugariness with coffee, turns out to mesh pretty well.  I would just appreciate the the price lowered or the size enlarged.So if you're in the Wicker area and are in need of a jolt of caffeine and nostalgia and a splash of Hipster angst, come on down to Wormhole.",4 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,4,Cool,2,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

My fellow yelpers led me to The Wormhole. I love this place! The barristas are warm and friendly, leading me to the appropriate beverage choice given my mood and personal tastes. They even decorate your latte with the swirls in your foam.  I had the Peanut Butter Koopatroopa (say that 3x fast!!), which was a great drink! Flavorful but not TOO sweet, i.e. I did not feel I was drinking dessert. Additionally this shop boasts super clean bathrooms, comfy chairs as well as tables,  free wi-fi and FUN 80's decor. From movie posters, to stuffed Smurfs and Ghostbusters gear, to YES a DeLorean. I personally loved their California Raisins memorabilia. This place takes me back to my very early childhood, and makes me nostalgic for times when I did not have tests to study for!This is a great shop, but it is missing that final star because 1. lack of lighting, with only windows in front it feels very intimate- which is great for a post dinner date experience, not so great when you are trying to study at 12pm. 2. Cost- if you think Starbucks is expensive you haven't seen anything yet. The 12oz here is the large size (equivalent to the Starbucks Tall), which costs between $4-$4.75.

It didn't sink to the bottom either, just wasn't there. So make sure it actually tastes like vanilla. I like that you can get cereal there anytime.

They have earned it by consistently preparing the highest quality coffee they can find, bringing guest roasts from across the continent. Their staff has earned it by being knowledgeable and helpful, especially when the shop is busy. They are personable without being sugary. They are attentive without being needy. They're the perfect coffeehouse staff. Questionable Content's Coffee of Doom staff has NOTHING on these folks.I suggest drinking your coffee in-house, if you can find a seat in this bustling Wicker Park location. If you've got a sweet tooth, any of their specialty lattes will please; each syrup is made in-house. If you are a true coffee geek, get a manual pourover. They have a row of V60s that they're using, and rumor is that they're planning on adding a vacpot or two to the line eventually. If you're in a hurry and can't stay, their auto-drip is always fresh, and with a top-of-the-line Fetco, it's no diner coffee.The wonderful, retrotastic interior design will pull you back to the 80s in an instant.

That is the only reason I give this place one star instead of petitioning Yelp to add a zero star rating. I came at 10:30 on Labor Day. The girl at the register was nice (although she forgot my muffin), but the generic dark-haired hipster dude making the coffee was awful. As I stood waiting for my wife's chai latte (rung up as a ""chai uh lebuff"". I promise I wanted to like this place), I witnessed him tell another couple that it was their fault he had dumped their drinks because they had not heard him announce their drinks from across the busy coffee shop (mind you, the staff was announcing drinks only to a corner of the shop at volumes more appropriate for a library). He grudgingly agreed to make their drinks again, complaining the entire time. As they put my wife's drink on the counter, another woman immediately grabbed it and stuck it in her mouth. She gets zero stars for human decency. I could not get the staff's attention, at which point my wife walked up to figure out why her latte had not come out for 20 minutes. I explained the situation to her, and went to drink my now-cold coffee. When (I assume) that woman's latte came out, another dude tried to claim it from my wife. When she said it was her's, the evil hipster dude said that she had probably missed her's and he had probably ""chucked it"" because she was not paying attention, and when she insisted that was not the case he turned his back and told her to work it with the other guy.There are more than a few places to get coffee in this neighborhood.

My only real complaint-and let's get it out of the way now-is they're too popular. Now, I could just order to go, but a major positive feature of Wormhole's is their decor; I require a substantial amount of creative stimulation, so being in that 80s-clad space with Star Wars mugs, 80s movie posters-both classic and not so much, Nintendo cartridges and Castle Grayskull replicas (!) satisfies that need.So, also, there's coffee. And the Honeybear Latte has set a new standard for me in the category ""hot brewed beverage""-I pretty much go the poor man's route anywhere else now and just squeeze entire containers of honey into a large latte (special shout-out to honey: it's amazing).",3 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,1,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

That's the kind of brain we need to pull this country out of the financial rut that it's in, lower the crime rate and maybe even make the digital television signal more stable. Basically this person watched VH1's I Love The 80s and went, ""I think that could be a café!"" The Wormhole has quite a bit to look at on the inside. Lunchboxes along the shelves, old toys and gadgets scattered throughout the place, an NES hooked up to a wood panel television set, and a real goddamn DeLorean parked right by the front door. I was having a hard time holding a conversation with my friend because I was too busy looking around and counting how many of their toys I had as a kid. I can't comment on their specialty drinks because I only drink regular black coffee, but it was one of the best damn cups of coffee I've had in a while: piping hot and full of flavor without that over roasted Starbucks taste. It wasn't cheap, but it was still a better value than the big name coffee chains.My only problem with this place is that, despite the ample seating, it gets full pretty fast.

Come to Detroit! Please!!! Ah, I would have LIVED in this place if it were near me in college. Holy smokes. A Delorean parked in the window? A living room setup with the original Nintendo? Various Star Wars toys, 80's movies posters & Ritual Coffee AND sugar cereals?! Old lunch boxes adorning the walls?! My god. I have died and gone to nerd heaven. The nostalgia that adorned every wall had me struck with a silly grimace the whole time I was in there. So, the coffee! I got the cappuccino. Top notch. If you've never had Ritual coffee, then this is your chance to see what's so special about it. For those of you who don't know, Ritual is known for solid, great tasting coffee. At Wormhole, it's done up proper barista style with a pretty little heart on top. That milk was frothed to froth perfection. And of all things in a place like this, they had pistachio macaroons. For a dollar?! Um yes & YUM. I can't get enough of the way they did up the place. It's like someone put a coffee shop in one of my gamer friends basements. My husband and I were inspired to have an old school Nintendo game night solely based off of our visit. It felt so welcoming & home like in there. They had some great music playing as well. Not to mention it's located in a great area of Wicker Park, steps away from some great shops. But why would you want to leave? Bring a book, laptop or just relax...play some old school Nintendo...The staff was super friendly too. Great coffee, one of a kind atmosphere. I think it's safe to safe to say.

They don't smile or greet,  and they seem really annoyed to have to serve. I feel like I am imposing on their conversation or something. I see from other reviews that my experience is not typical. Maybe they don't like me because I order crazy concoctions, such as a the single shot latte I tried for yesterday. I was told that they ""don't do that"" so I opted instead for iced tea, which was served with abundant tea leave floaters. It was awful.  I tossed the tea about two blocks away.

After a crappy morning this was exactly what I needed. The baristas were friendly, helpful, and not condescending at all. I had a truly well-made latte and a deliciously moist blueberry muffin (with lots of big blueberries!). Neither of which can be found from any corporate coffee place. Seriously, have any of those Starbucks executives ever had a real latte? Just sayin'.As a non-hipster who barely remembers the 80's (because I was young - not because I was having a good time) I wasn't sure I would be cool enough for Wormhole. But this place is great. It's really spacious and at 8:30 on a weekday it wasn't busy. The music was not too loud. You can definitely have a conversation or use headphones without having to compete with the music.

This isn't to say I dislike the place, and I'm sure I'll be back, but I simply cannot get as excited about this coffee shop's existence as everyone else.First, the positives. It's a comfortable space, albeit a crowded one, and if your tastes run to the dorktastic, you'll love the '80s decor (I think it's really over the top and tacky, but it's not like you have to pay attention to the geek paraphernalia if you don't want to). The baristas are friendly and efficient, and at least when I was there the music was at a very reasonable volume and was a good mix of indie and, of course, '80s hits. If you can score a seat it's a good place to hang out, get caffeinated, and read/play on your laptop/whatever. Now, the downside. First of all, this place does get insanely crowded. There was actually a line to even use the bathroom. I'm sure this comes and goes according to the time of day, but don't expect to get a seat immediately. Secondly, and this is the real killer for me, their standard brewed coffee is just subpar. Yes, it's Metropolis, and yes, that's a good roaster, but here it was acidic and, worst of all, served warm at best...certainly not hot. Perhaps their specialty drinks are better, but a place that can't deliver a basic cup of coffee properly is not a place I would go out of my way to support.",7 people voted for this review,Useful,2,Funny,7,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I have had both the peanut butter (swoon) and the vanilla latte. I'm a sucker for homemade syrups, and this place does them well. Of course, the decor is unique and targeted to the perfect hip customer. The only thing that takes a way a star is the macaroon I ordered this time.

But it was good, and the people working there were very nice and friendly. There was a cooler with some premade food that looked good, if you're into that sort of thing.The place is comfy and cozy and truly a blast from the past.

Real bad.Friday night, I went to espression by lavazza at ogilvie, because I was craving a coffee drink, and I got this drink with espresso, hazelnut, and some other yummy-sounding things. It was $4, and it was terrible. I threw it out.Then, I went to a vendor inside the French market to get some simple metropolis drip $1.50. Cold. :-/ damn.Sunday, I went to Starbucks, craving mocha and it was godawful, $4, I threw half of it out. A little later, I went to New Wave, decided they didn't have any coffee I wanted so I got cider, which was good. I also visited kickstand on the same day and got a decent, expensive caffe mocha. I also bought some metropolis beans. Mmm.This weekend was a coffee sandwich, because Friday and Sunday I had mediocre coffee experiences. But Saturday was a whole different story.Saturday morning, I came here. Not a big thing. I love this place. But usually I just get the insanely delicious ""Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa"" (doppio, steamed milk, pb mousse, dark chocolate something-or-other) which is fantastic.But I was feeling like I needed food, and so I got a bowl of reese's puffs. But not any old bowl of reese's puffs. A bowl of reese's puffs with a shot of espresso and chocolate in my milk. HEEELLLL YEEEAHHH. and on my way out, I was tempted and treated to (infinite thanks) a ""Walter the Peck"" a hot-cold experiment seemingly straight out of Alinea.

Get it? I know. I know. If you have to explain the joke, it's not funny. Anyhow, on with my story of writer's block.  Each November, in theory, I try to write 50,000 words as part of National Novel Writing Month.  Not surprisingly, with how bad I suck at deadlines despite starting out in college as a Journalism major, as the second week of November began, I found myself horribly behind pace.  I figured my only hope of getting back on track was to get thyself to a coffee shop (and quickly go) for the needed inspiration of others tap-tap-tapping away on keyboards!  And this is probably the best tap-tap-tapping place I've found in Chicago. Now, it's not for the kitsch or the nostalgia. I leave those concepts up to the hipsters who frequent here typing away at art school papers and reading obscure novels (except for the $1.75 flashback cereals, I love those). For me, this place is all about the amenities. Sure there are interesting posters of classic 1980s movies and lunch boxes up on the wall. But the plentiful power outlets that run underneath them are what sugars my (yummy, $2.50 for a large mug, peppermint herbal) tea. Sure they look a little bit sketchy, like they're from the 1980s themselves or something. But the slight potential excitement of a fire is better than having a dying laptop. And sure there's the obligatory 1980s music playing overhead (mixed of course, since this is Wicker Park, with indie rock anthems) but, more important to me is the futuristic speed of the free wi-fi. It was so fast, that I was actually able to stream music on Rhaspody from the present day while working on a Word document and playing on Yelp (can you tell why I haven't gotten much noveling done?). In 1987 that would have seemed more mindblowingly high tech than time travelling in a Delorean. The crowds seem to know about all of this tubularness, so it's often packed. However, there's enough interesting things to see and do (it's basically a museum) while waiting for seating that it doesn't seem that bad or even a waste of time.",6 people voted for this review,Useful,5,Funny,3,Cool,4,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The coffee is really good, but smaller portion and more expensive than New Wave, I think. The large cup seemed to be barely bigger than the size of a Starbucks ""tall."" I get the attraction of the barista's artistic frothy designs on the drinks, but the added labor must make the difference in price. I have been back a couple of times whenever I'm further down on Milwaukee away from Logan Square. The atmosphere is very hipster, which I normally like, but this was a little over the top for me. Kinda uptown hipster. On one visit, the counter person was using an iPad to ring up my purchase. The iPad kept freezing or having some problem. Stood there for quite a while waiting on the Apple device to allow me to pay. I made some smart-aleck remark, ""If only you had a cash register, huh."" Boy, did that get me a nasty stare down. I thought I was being very patient and as clever as I could given the circumstances. Finally paid. Looked around and noticed the customers sitting down at the tables all had shiny Apple MacBooks with the glowing Apple logo. It looked like a scene of seed pods from the remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Not quite cool enough to be the original, but the decor is definitely 80s enough to be the remake, starring Donald Sutherland in that awful perm. The quality of coffee, and the opportunity to study Mac users in their natural habitat, I will have to give it 4 stars, but barely.

Oh well, its still a place i would come to.. so its all good!Interior is very retro. Staff is SO INCREDIBLY sweet. Their sandwich was mislabeled and i ended up eating meat ( on a day that i was not supposed to, im hindu, so sue me). The girl behind the counter was so sweet when i went to return the sandwich and took all the other ones out of the fridge shelf because they were all mislabeled. After i got my money back, i went back for a delicious lemon scone instead- when the guy was ringing it up, she told him not to and that it was on the house :)  ( because of the sandwich mess up ) YAY, i love desserts , even more so when they are free :)The bf and i got a table in the back and we just studying on a long bench with others. The outlet was on the opposite side of the table, but people on the table with us were sweet- offering to guide our messy wires around their coffees, under their mac's and into the outlets. The rest of the shop is very cute- the makeshift Delorean in the window, posters, theres a couch where people play old school videogames, the bathroom is super clean ( which is the least i can say about starbucks!) Oh yea, all their stuff is natural- so the most processed thing you will find there is splenda. No sugar free shots, nothing that will dirty your body. Yum!Coffee was good and so was my mocha- but nothing too special. My scone was definitely a 4 star scone. WH (wormhole) has free wifi, which is a major plus! My only problem with this place is the location- its right on milwakee.. so everyone and their mom is here. Also, parking on milwakee during the day SUCKS MONKEY D@#$. So, we were 5 min late feeding the meter - and were granted a 50$ ticket courtesy of the chicago revenue department! All in all, coffee ended up costing us about 7$, parking about 4$, and ticket 50$.

My mutagen. My Triforce. OK, now that I have all the 80s pop culture references out of my system...One of the reasons I am going to miss being funemployed is places like The Wormhole. It's located in Wicker Park, or as some people call it Hipster Central. Walking into The Wormhole that's the first impression you get. Dudes in tight jeans, sweater vests, plastic glasses. The place isn't obnoxious. It's actually pretty friendly. The barista greeted me with a smile, and pulled some espresso for my Americano, which he served to me in an actual fancy coffee cup, not a mug, not a paper cup. I sat on a sofa, laptop on lap, free wi-fi piped in. And when I say ""free"" I mean you don't have to type in a code. All you need is the password that they provide. The espresso drinks were good. For me, too much caffeine would have exploded my head.  As another review implied, if you have a short attention span, you will be distracted. I spent thirty minutes staring at a game of Super Mario Brothers that was being played and another twenty reading the 80s pop culture artifacts on the walls and the shelves.

I was never much of a trendster hipster, but I am a coffee house denizen. I was on my way back from downtown Chicago and decided to make a stop a visit a friend of mine working at Myopic Books and figured as long as I was in the area, might as well get some actual work done so I whipped out my Droid and its Yelp app and started searching for a cafe. Wormhole popped up and I started hoofing it on over. Walked in and gave an all-knowing internal nod. I knew where I was. I was surrounded by bespeckled hipsters immersed in Kant, skinny jean-clad and painfully aware that they were unaware someone might be watching them, so they better look lost in thought. This was my scene 20 years ago, now I felt a little out of place but I grabbed a coffee and muffin nonetheless. Now this isn't any sort of damning judgement on Wormhole, at no time was I made to feel awkward or unwelcome. Quite to the contrary the staff was great and the customers too. The coffee? Meh. But the muffin? It was a vegan chocolate pile of awesome and I'd return just get a chance to smell it. Delicious. My real complaint is the lack of flat surfaces! I know it's a coffee joint but I reserve my rights as a cantankerous old man so I'd rather they had a few more tables and a few less sofas so I could work more comfortably. But that's a ridiculous complaint so I'll stop right there.Wormhole is good, I could totally see myself hanging out there if I lived in the area.

I like it for these reasons: The coffee is good. There is free wi-fi. There is an enormous replica of the Dolorian from Back II the Future near the door, a working Nintendo with games, and abundant nerd-chick early 90s memorabilia. There are big comfortable chairs and couches as well as one of those long thin tables with outlets for laptops at regular intervals. The reasons I don't come here more often are: I need to be able to study, and it's very dimly lit. The laid-back vibe and bad lighting are more conducive to a nap or a chat than to doing work.  This place is also often so crowded that I have trouble finding a seat at all, much less a seat near an outlet for my computer. I'm agnostic about the food situation, since I come here to drink caffeinated potables and not to buy lunch. However, I don't think they have much food aside from pastries (which I haven't tried, but they do look tasty) and sandwiches which are pre-made and in a refrigerator near the registers.I would probably frequent this place more often if I lived nearby--but I also don't go out of my way to come here.

The music is ambient, not club-like so A+ for general environment and atmosphere.  And to the other reviewers on here-- Ok, the Delorean is cool. But seriously, WE KNOW. Honestly I got over it like the third time I went. You're judging a cafe on what kind of discontinued vehicle it has in its storefront... seriously?I want to like WoHo but for someone like me who needs a cafe to haunt (I can't get work done at home) this place is hugely frustrating. First of all, there's barely ever a place to sit so I have to leave before I even order. This Cafe is famous to a fault (probably thanks to you know what). Assuming you don't get a seat at the one main table, you have to compete with hipster social hour on the couches or Super Mario Bros. Again, this would be awesome if I didn't have things to get done.  I realize I'm one of these deplorable laptop geeks that plague cafes, but can I please be one in peace-- there are others like me.The coffee is perfunctory. More often than not it's scorched or not even poured fresh. I like soy lattes and I know they're harder to make but the crema sometimes is just destroyed.They also don't have any microlot coffees (I'm not subtracting a star for this though as I realize most cafes don't!) Their single-origins are eh. The baristas are nice, but not always knowledgeable or above and beyond if you know what I mean. I went a day after Halloween and they were all busy complaining in a side conversation with another customer about a woman who had given them two stars on Yelp... I kid you not.   Alas, Wormhole I love you but you're bringing me down.I'm looking forward to Caffe Streets opening as it's both closer to where I live and presumably a more comfortable workspace.

The tea selection is really great. One of the baristas is not shy about letting you know what she thinks about the various teas. The atmosphere is pleasant and non-stressed, unlike Starbucks that often feels like a coffee pick up place with loud, sassy music. I think it's a good way to get rid of people. Wormhole has none of that. The music was great ... an urban background that allowed for conversation of its patrons. Imagine that! Plenty of space to spread out with comfy couches and some tables. They even make use of the front window as a seating area.I took a star off because despite my friend finding and handing me a drink card, the cashier did not even bother to punch the two ""dranks"" on the card. That's pretty shitty. I've noticed that of late; vendors offering all kinds of freebies, and then not following through. A little shocking, given the state of the economy.

As someone raised on movies like Gremlins, Ghostbusters, and the Goonies, entering the Wormhole was an amazing experience for me. While it has already been said 100 times on here, a full-size DeLorean in the front window is hard to beat. How about the Christmas Gizmo doll on the wall? Nostalgia aside, the baristas at Wormhole brew a mean espresso. Mine was perfect...not too bitter, but not diluted either. I also enjoyed a skim mocha, which had a nice balance between the chocolate and espresso. As for the seating area, there is kind of a weird layout. You have some long tables at the back of the store with hard chairs. Then, you have a couple of couches and soft chairs right in front of the long tables. From there, you have a large, wide-open space. Finally, there is one small table w/ a couple of chairs in the front corner of the store. I kinda like the layout, though I was fortunate enough to get that small table by the front window. Had I been forced to sit at one of the long tables in the back, my experience might have been different. With that in mind, while the quality of coffee at Wormhole is equal to Intelligentsia, I prefer Wormhole because of the aforementioned ""blast from the past"" atmosphere that it provides. The one complaint I have (and this has nothing to do with Wormhole) is that the Wicker Park area only has a few nice blocks of shops and bars. While Wormhole is located in the shopping stretch area of Milwaukee Ave., once you hit Milwaukee and Division, the area starts becoming sketch. That being said, if you stay within those few blocks along Milwaukee, Damen, and North, you should be fine.",1 person voted for this review,Useful,1,Funny,,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I love video games, I love Ghostbusters, I love Back to the Future... the list goes on. Wormhole seems like it was INVENTED for me. Obviously, as other reviewers have pointed out, the DeLorean in the window is just awesome. But everything else is awesome too, from the posters to the collectible figurines speckled about the cafe.Wormhole serves the highest-quality lattes I have had in Chicago. Period. Filter, Alliance, Intelligencia, Starbucks, Einstein Bagels, Goddess and Grocer - ANYWHERE you go, you can't get a latte better done than this. Even more shockingly, every latte on the menu is high-quality (I have sampled them all).Now, the drinks are pretty expensive. A ""small"" is 8oz, and a ""large"" is 12oz - the same size as a tall drink at Starbucks. And you'll pay $4.00-4.25 for that ""large"" drink. But again, the quality matters - and I have (somewhat begrudgingly) gone back again and again to drink the high-quality beverages there. So yes, it's pricey, but it's worth it, so I can't dock it any points just because I don't have the kind of income needed to spend $4 every time I get a drink.I love the atmosphere, and with only two windows, it's a pretty dark interior, especially compared to Filter, the other neighborhood ""I'm going to sit here on my laptop and study or write a paper for the next 6 hours."" If you're looking for a ton of coffee and food and windows to wake you up, then go to Filter. If you want to go somewhere dark and cozy, with decor that will certainly delight if not distract, then go to Wormhole.",3 people voted for this review,Useful,3,Funny,2,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

This is perhaps my favorite coffee shop in all the land.Actually, the decor is quite nice. A product of the 80's (and I'm NOT bragging, simply noting why all of the posters, old school Nintendo sets and themes strewn about appeal to me) I can appreciate the variations on a theme.Delorian, dimly lit tables to cozy into near the back and well lit window seats and tables in front really make for the perfect interior. A little ""something for everyone.""The coffee is also extremely tasty. Smooth and never bitter and there are combinations I'd never have opted for had I not been to Wormhole (a Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa?!).The staff is pleasantly aloof. This sometimes annoys me and I feel as though a genuine smile works the best. Service is a bit hit or miss for me. Some days I receive that genuine smile and others I get rushed through my order and barely dealt with. The ice queen(or king) act at independent coffee shops must be written in their memo-books someplace.It's getting old but hell, your coffee is delicious so perhaps you know folks will be back in no matter the demeanor.I'm a steady patron, that's for certain.Overall, this place is tops.

Their coffee de-jour tends to have a different brewing method for each, and the one we got, if I remember correctly, was Nicaraguan brewed in a Chemex (which he attempted to explain until he realized we understood how it worked). That always shows that your barista is a knowledgable barista. Then he told us that if we both wanted the same thing, he'd just basically make one big brew and split the coffee between us. I think that means he brewed a 16oz. It was four bucks for the two of us. An honest barista is a friendly barista.So, was the coffee any good, you ask? Sure-- if you like acidic coffee. If you know your coffee and know your coffee regions, I guess you already knew that about Nicaragua beans, but I didn't. It starts off acidic and kind of lingers until you finish the sip off. Granted this process lasts about five seconds, but still.My gentlemanfriend called this joint ""pretentious,"" with a little grin and short laugh, whatever that could possible mean.

Of course, it is a coffee shop, so its time to talk about my peanut butter blaster mocha(or something like that). It was truly delicious- I kind of expected it to taste sugary sweet and over the top, but what I got was so much better than that. The chocolate taste was rich and smooth and it had a deep aroma of peanuts rather than a dessert-like drink. For those of you who don't normally do sweet drinks, give this a try and you might very well be surprised. Also, I got a free chocolate muffin from their ""day old"" basket.

(Trust me, you do not want to see me after half a cup of coffee.) The ambiance, the wifi, the comfortable seating, the snacks, the occasional friends I run into... they're better places to hang out and get things done than my living room.This place has high scores on most of my coffeeshop criteria. Lots of comfy cushy chairs for my bony ass? Check. Fun look to the place? I like the eighties theme stuff, but the color theme is a dark bluish grey... not energizing (though it's well executed.) Also it was a little showroom-y, things matched a little too well. Give it a 4 out of five. Snack/drink selection? I got there at the end of the day, so it seemed a little thin, but you know, being a night owl, I'll probably be there at the end of the day in general. But my banana nut muffin was quite good. The chai latte was also good, if small. Again, four out of five? Free wifi? Why would I hang out at a place without wifi? I didn't notice any slowdowns. Check.Late hours? Open till midnight--sweet! Check.Other friends hanging out there? First time I visit, there's a bunch of my friends from Pumping Station: One to geek out with. Check.So-- the debate is: do I give it a 4 or a 5? Hard call. If I was a coffee drinker, I'd definitely go 5. But the weak snack selection didn't do it for me (hint: something substantial and chocolatey at the point-of-sale display and I'm yours.) And the showroom ambiance did not seem creatively stimulating. I'd go here to test code, maybe, but not to brainstorm new ideas.I wanted to love this place. I'm not in love, but I like it a lot.

The honey bear latte offered a delicious union of bitter espresso and sweet honey. It was perfect for me. The barista was super friendly and easy to joke around with. He even gave me a card to come back for a ""free drank"" so that I wouldn't have a choice but to come back again. Which is fine by me! I would have come back even without it!

Usually one of the first things that puts me off of a new shop (aside from bad drinks of course) is the space itself. With Delorians, Star Wars toys, He-Man toys, and other awesome 70's/80's decor it's hard not to love the shop. It's also got a lot more space to move around and doesn't feel closed in and cramped like a lot of shops these days.It's refreshing for the decor to not feature a vintage/thrift store style setting as that whole thing is getting a bit stale.The staff is super nice and professional and they definitely know their drinks. The vanilla iced latte made for me (by the super cute barista) was fantastic!If this place is as awesome as it is in the first week of opening I can't wait to see how things turn out when they get everything in proper order.

We ordered two of their specialty lattes -- the Drunken Citrus Mocha and the Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa.  Carefully brewed and blended and served just hot enough for immediate enjoyment.  And well worth the nearly $5 a cup!  Both were sweet without being overdone, yet with strains of syrup flavor between the roasty flavor of the coffee.  Simply put, these were two perfectly amazing concoctions.While I doubt I could afford to do this often, both for financial and nutritional reasons, I was impressed enough by their technique and willingness to push the envelope that I'd make a point to come back here again next time I am in the neighborhood.  These folks are doing things with coffee and flavorings that I have not seen attempted elsewhere.  So if you enjoy coffee and all of the delectable treats can result from blending it with creams and sugars, you owe it to yourself to take a dive into the Wormhole.  Good stuff done right!",2 people voted for this review,Useful,1,Funny,,Cool,1,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all up for hanging Top Gun movie posters in Italian, scattering atari games everywhere, and (of course) parking a delorean in the front window. It's just that the average customer age here is probably around 22, and we didn't really grow up with that stuff... so I'm not really sure what to make of it. Imagine, a decade from now, people who are 12 now hanging out at a coffee shop with posters for The Matrix and Independence Day, Green Day on the speakers, and a cut-out of Monica Lewinsky in a corner somewhere.
