0,"Cozy neighborhood spot for a good coffee and yummy sandwiches. We stopped in for a few hours to work and the WiFi, the sound level and light was perfect for getting things done. If you're nice to the barista, they may make you a fun latte with funky art on it, and their latte flavors range from standard to different. The lavender one was lovely and the spicy one had just the right touch of heat. We got one of the sandwiches after a while and it came with veggie chips on a plate that looked like a painter's palette, which was fun. And the sandwich was fresh and tasty.","So I live relatively close now, and an update is due.  While it's still fairly difficult to get a seat, I dig this spot.  The coffee is good, the food is good (better options then most shops), and they recently upgraded many of their tables and chairs.  Internet never seems to be an issue here, and the staff has grown on me (for the most part).  They also finally added some curtains so if you are sitting by the windows in the afternoon you aren't constantly blinded.I give them 4.5 stars (subtracting a 1/2 star for the bathrooms which could use a little updating).  Bonus for the free espresso shot when you buy one of their bags of coffee.  That should be standard everywhere.","There's a reason why Intelligentsia is at the top of the coffee  rankings in the US, and dare I say the world. The hype is real and everyone should know it. Coffee offerings rotate depending on the season but the staples are like all the other Intelligentsia locations. Everything is freshly made, including the basic coffee. So be patient while they do a pour over. They also offer alternatives like soy and oat milk. Yes I said oat milk. The baristas are excellent now and quite friendly if you're into communicating before your caffeine. Good and quick service any time of the day. As you enter in the merch and bagged coffee is on the right before you hit the counter. The coffee offering list is posted on the wall to the right of where you place your order. Still not sure what to order? Just ask. The biggest problem about this location is seating. While there is plenty of it at the communal table and smaller tables, this location is just busy. Am I complaining? Not at all! There are outlets around the perimeter inside but sometimes snagging a seat on the wall can be difficult, especially in the mornings when everyone is going to work. Hey, we all need our fix.","Went here on a hot day after walking the 606. The iced vanilla latte and nutella latte were exactly what we needed. They were made right in front of us and tasted delicious.The staff was quite nice, one of them talked us in to trying their mini donuts (spoiler: they were delicious). We tried the cinnamon sugar and the orange lemon. Super small, but they are called mini donuts. If you go after 4pm, they're half price as well!The atmosphere is really cool in there. Most people had their laptops out and were working by the open windows. Limited seating, but we found a place at the bar. I highly recommend.","It's about time I write a review for this place. I go here almost every day to work and get tea. My to go is the Matcha Latte with Oat Milk for the morning, and the Molly Weasly (this awesome chamomille/honey tea drink) for night. The book selection is really good and they have cute little nick nacks. They sell some pastries and the staff is super friendly. Good wifi, comfy blue chairs in the corner, and great coffee and books. That's pretty much all you need to know.",A unique experience. Upon walking inside Wormhole coffee you'll be transported to a place filled with items from an 80s time capsule. There is a decent amount of seating but it's usually packed. Bring headphones if you want to get any work done on your computer since the ambient music is louder than most coffee shops.Beverages and service are slightly above average but let's be honest you're going out of your way to experience the atmosphere here not be blown away by the coffee beans.,"Where do I begin? I need 10 stars for this place! I had a not so great experience when I went to this shop but oh boy, did they make up for it or what?! I sent some feedback through their website and the Head Bageler, Jotam Torres,  personally took the time to write me back. He wrote: ""I'm so sorry to hear that you had a tough experience at my shop. Totally unacceptable and I want to make sure that others don't have a similar experience."" He then asked me to describe the person so he could personally address the issue right away. He then connected me with his Operations Director and offer me a gift card. He ended by saying: ""If anything happens again that isn't to your liking no matter how small, please reach out to me directly to this email address."" This is what I call caring. Due to an unfortunate event, I cannot receive the card. Upon informing him, he wrote back again! ""I'm so sorry for your loss Sandra.Not to worry, if and when you return it will be waiting for you.Thank you again so much for your honesty and your help.Jotam""Amazing! Love you guys!!!","Absolutely LOVE this place. Today was my first time going and I am quite sure I have found my new study spot! This cafe offers coffee, tea, sandwiches, breakfast, and so much more! They have booth indoor and outdoor seating. They also have a side of the cafe which used to be a house which they renovated. (So cute). It was cozy, quiet and bright enough. They have both couches and table/chairs as options to sit at! They do offer free WiFi. I ordered the Chai Latte (recommend with coconut milk) and the Great Gatsby sandwich. Both were awesome and I'd easily get those both again. Note: the great gatsby full size sandwich was HUGE. I was only able to finish half. I would recommend sharing or getting a half size. The service was great! I'll definitely be back!","This is probably my favorite coffee and eatery place in streeterville. You can grab a scrumptious bite, eat a delicious meal or hangout here with friends. You could also just chill or work with your laptop or iPad here as well as they provide free WiFi and plenty of electrical sockets.","This location is very busy and there is a wait, but it is apparent that they try. There are many people working in the morning and it is nice that they say ""Thank you for waiting"" when they know it is on the longer side. Sometimes when people say that, it helps. I work nearby and go to this location because the baristas are friendly and describe their menu. (its busy and line is long for a reason folks!) Thanks Dollop for my honey cinnamon latte with soy milk! I tried one of their fall drinks (babe on the rocks? I think) and  it was good but with the weather getting cold, I'll stick to my regular. My only complaint is that sometimes a lot they run out of oat milk, but they explain that this happens to many places because of the demand/production issue. So okay, not their fault.","Happy to have found a place that locals frequent. Friendly & efficient service, varied menu with good espresso, tasty treats, and cute decor!Would recommend refining hand-off to make sure there are no used grounds stuck to coffee cups or residual food spreads on to-go containers.Overall great experience.","I'm a big fan of Intelligentsia and this is one of my favorite locations of theirs. Tucked into a historical Chicago building it has awesome old timely ambiance. That is until you go to order and are met with all the latest trends in artisan coffee. They certainly don't disappoint with their beverages. A beautifully crafted coffee, an oat milk chai, iced tea, and other treats. You can't go wrong.","This restaurant has reopened as Peach's at Currency Exchange Cafe.I stopped @peachs_exchange yesterday with my niece and..OMG  I was killing my nieces Shrimp & Grits!!  The service is neighborhood friendly (gives the cheers vibe) and food was delicious.  If I wasn't on a tight budget this week I'd be back in there today.  Those cheesy, creamy, flavorful grits with bacon, onions, tomatoes was doing a dance in my mouth.  I couldn't stop eating them. The shrimp were large and perfectly cooked where they were still succulent and popping with flavor. I ordered the peach bourbon French toast which was very tasty, but those grits stole the show.  I ended up getting my French toast to go and shared grits and truffle fries with my niece.The fries came with a delicious spicy creole sauce that would be perfect on salmon croquettes (getting on my next visit) and that had some amazing banana ketchup.The chef actually came out and talked to us about how they infuse the ketchup with bananas which was cool for my niece to hear and have more appreciation for our dining experience.  We experienced friendly service, OMG delicious food at a decent price for fresh quality food. Can't wait to get back.",The coffee here is SO good. I recommend the iced mocha with coconut milk.The location is very spacious. It's perfect for meeting someone for coffee or studying. They also have some outdoor seating.Service is quick and friendly. 10/10 would highly recommend.,"This place deserves all the hype it gets. i've been coming here almost daily since starting work down the street. I always order coffee black and the quality is stupendous. I've started getting the lunch recently and the Big Payback is delicious, not too much and reasonably priced. The staff is always friendly and parking is easy. Ill keep on coming back so long as they keep on being awesome!","My friend and I came here for lunch on a Friday. I have been to Medici many many times as it's a classic for students at the University - it's located just two blocks from the main campus.I ordered the Fresh Mozz sandwich and Cream of Mushroom and Spinach soup from their specials menu. The sandwich comes with a choice of thin-cut fries, potato chips, coleslaw, or potato salad, so I went with the coleslaw. They are very generous with their sides - you can tell from the photo how ginormous the portion of coleslaw is compared to the sandwich. I ended up having to take half the sandwich and some of coleslaw to-go - big portions means more leftovers!Anyway, it's a great place for some hearty food. I advise against the sandwiches made with baguettes since my experience with the baguettes have been that they are always too hard/crunchy. Popular at this establishment are their pizzas and milkshakes. I always come out feeling stuffed - so if you're looking for something light to eat perhaps the Med is not for you.","This is probably one of my favorite places to do work on campus. They have such a good selection of drinks and food. Their hot chocolate is amazing! My fiancé got an espresso which he liked as well. They also have a wide range of pastries as well as separate breakfast and lunch menus. The prices here may seem expensive for Hyde park but they're nothing compared to the prices we have downtown! I loved the mascarpone stuffed French toast! It was such a good mix of creamy mascarpone and blueberry sauce. Absolutely delightful! The biscuit breakfast sandwich was also good but paled in comparison to the French toast. There is seating indoors and outdoors, although it was a bit crowded (Sunday morning). It was quite chilly when I was there but some people had to sit outside due to lack of seating inside. There are outlets through the seating area. I love the large windows that give plenty of natural light to the space. I'll have to go at lunch time next time to try out their lunch menu!","First and foremost, this place is huge! That alone made me a fan within seconds. It does a brisk business and yet there's always seating to be had. The staff is very nice and accommodating, the space is well-maintained, and the coffee and sandwiches are good, and very fairly priced. The only complaint I had, and it's minor, is the donut. Not that good. Frosting, yes. But the rest of it was a little tasteless. But that's small stuff. Robust is well worth a visit. At least three times a week, I bike down from the North Side to somewhere on the South Side or Western Suburbs for exercise and exploration, then work remotely, so I'll be coming in all fall and winter. This place is a keeper. Pro-tip: It will get a little loud during the bottom of the 3:00 hour when a lot of kids roll in rom one of the local schools. They're fine overall, but they are teenagers, so they're going to be a little loud. But the vast majority of them take their food to go, so it's a mild annoyance at worst."
1,"I thought this cafe was okay. I got the matcha latte (iced) and felt like I was just drinking light green milk. It didn't seem to have too much flavor (not terribly sweet, and the matcha flavor wasn't that strong).The latte art for their hot drinks was cool though. Almost looked like a honey comb of sorts. I've never seen that at any other coffee shop and I've been to a lot!The ambiance was okay. Our table was a bit wobbly so it was hard to work on for long periods of time. The lighting was mostly from the window, but it was a bit overcast that day so it wasn't extremely bright.",Roasted: came here because I couldn't drink the coffee at the last place and was really hoping for a better experience. This is a quiet cafe in Logan square - kind of reminds me of a 50's diner converted into a coffee shop. They don't offer any sugar free options which is common among the third wave shops. The latte was not good. The espresso was bitter - I struggled to drink the latte and sadly didn't enjoy it. My latte art was sad - I appreciate the attempt but didn't get even a flower. Nice to have for here mugs. Has to put Splenda in my latte but that still didn't make it enjoyable. They used Guatemala for their daily espresso which could be partly why I didn't enjoy it. Unroasted:  okay let's try this again.   Walking in it looks and feels like your pops den.    The staff was friendly but counting down the minutes to get out of here.    Love the 50s diner style coffee bar.    The art was decent and appreciate the effort.    Coffee was too bitter for me had to add sugar.,"Always a pleasure coming to this intelli location, it's perhaps my favorite one in the city cause it's quite spacious and love the interior.Had coffee with my friend Juan 6:30 this morning, and being here early in the morning is super chill.We both had a pour-over and I think it's worth the extra couple of bucks compared to other coffee shops. If you are a coffee connoisseour, worth every penny. Very rich and refreshing to have in the morning. Baristas were friendly, nothing to complain. Overall a great experience at one of the best coffee spots in the city!","Espresso served too hot, bean quality not impressive (Wildfire Espresso). Latte art quality - fuggedaboutit.Beautiful interior, great place to work. But just had to call a spade a spade on the main offering here - the Coffee.","Regardless of the SJW crap all over their windows, these owners purposely contribute to increasing homelessness!In addition to and in direct contradiction to the extremist signs on their windows, claiming that ""billions of women"" have ""no voice"" in America which is EXTREMELY obviously untrue, this business DIRECTLY propagates, promotes, and participates in the disenfranchisement of a HUGE group that actually IS oppressed...   homeless people.  This sign claiming that all human beings are not human beings, and therefore are not allowed to even pee according to this business, causes huge problems to and discrimination against not only homeless people, but, in the case of any such business in many areas of Chicago including Wicket Park, this also disenfranchises, dehumanizes, and heavily discriminates against, anyone who is from regular suburbs and in fact even anyone who lives in a slightly different area of Chicago, such as say, downtown, since for them as well it is also impossible for them to go home just to pee.  This business has several other antagonistic signs up to hurt and harm people.  It is obvious that this business should not be patronized.","If you like craft coffee mixed with 80's nostalgia mixed with video game memorabilia then you have to pay a visit to The Wormhole Coffee. It was packed when I came in on Saturday morning and the coffee is worth the wait. My friend ordered the koopa troopa drink, which is like a peanut butter cup in liquid form. I was kicking myself for not ordering that while I was waiting for my hand brewed coffee. But for coffee lovers, the rotating selection of brews is excellent here. The baristas know what they are doing, my coffee came out perfect. Surprisingly it was a great temp where I could basically immediately have a sip once my brew was ready. The atmosphere is amazing. I love all the intricate details they have placed throughout from the stained glass Nintendo to the Delorean in the back. I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often, but it's def on my list as a must visit to take friends when they are in town.","4.5 stars. GREAT bagels and cream cheese here. They were temporarily out of my usual bagel of choice (they bake throughout the day, so shortages are resolved quickly), so instead I got a piping hot chocolate chip bagel with honey nut cream cheese. Both were delicious, and they give an appropriately generous schmear of cream cheese. My only complaint is that their chai latte, which is tea based (which I prefer!) doesn't taste very much like chai. Maybe their blend is off, but the latte tasted like a London fog rather than a proper chai. Other than that, though, it was absolutely heavenly for this bagel-lover.","I went there today for the first time and ordered the breakfast burrito, and it got served to me with no avocado and no cilantro.  When I went back to the counter to ask about it, the guy that took my order had no idea why it was missing those ingredients.  He asked the woman in the back - whom I could clearly see standing right there - and she didn't even look up from chopping something to say, ""we're out.""  And that was it.Total cost for a coffee and a shitty burrito:  $18No thanks.","I had breakfast here this past week. I really enjoy the design, the customer service and the food was tasty. I especially enjoyed the hash browns and yummy ketchup. I had a Nutella Latte with Coconut milk that was delicious as well. I like how they have sparkling water available on tap too! I only have one suggestion for the management - do you think you could provide recycling in your restaurant? I asked for my food ""to go"" but then I ended up having a few extra minutes to eat there, but when I tried to recycle my plastic container there was only a garbage can :( I took it with me to recycle at home, but would really appreciate if you guys could offer this at your restaurant! I will totally update my review to 5 stars if you do this! Thanks.","This place has a lot of mosquitos inside, strangely enough.Not kidding, during the day in the summer there are dozens of mosquitos swarming around inside around the tables where customers sit. You can see smashed mosquitos on the wall, and other mosquitos trapped(?) somehow hanging out. It's disturbing and disgusting. I've been here half a dozen times in the summer, and it's always the same. Never would have thought that MOSQUITOS would keep me from going to a coffee place.","What a delightful little coffee shop. The name alone has a warm and comforting feeling. We were staying at the hotel across the street and needed a spot to get some work done on a cold day. Atmosphere: clean, well lit, modern. Very busy on a weekend afternoon (full of laptops and bookworms). Beverages: I did peruse the menu and they have a variety of lattes and hot teas; I was a little disappointed they don't have an apple cider. We both ordered hot cocoa, and it was deliciously rich.Price: average; comparable to Starbucks.","Anytime I come to Chicago, usually a stop to an Intelligentsia happens. While it is one of the larger 3rd wave coffee chains, I still find they produce a great cup of coffee and are consistent. Stopped here for a quick cup to go and was not disappointed. They have a two pour over options and only one brewed ahead of time. Good variety of beans, Ethiopian, El Salvador, and a Kenya.",Only a one star because it was closed. I've heard rave reviews about it.... i took the time to travel and saw the sign that it has been closed. I wish that folks would take the time to edit that on businesss pages Yelp said it was open and so did Google.,"I've been here three times now and I'm always disappointed by my drink or by the service. The first time I just ordered coffee and a banana, and the cashier did not understand how paying in cash works, considering that  I gave her coins so I wouldn't get coins back, and she proceeded to give me less money back as change... and she refused to see she was wrong. The next time I got a hot chocolate. It just tasted like warm milk. There was no chocolate flavor. This last time I got a pumpkin spice latte with almond milk. First they gave me the wrong drink (a hazelnut latte). They were nice enough to give me the drink and then make my own drink. But the drink they made me didn't taste like pumpkin and did not taste good at all. The hazelnut one wasn't good either. Moral of the story: come here for tea and to do hw. Go elsewhere if you want something beyond that.","Really dug the decor and the coffee was excellent. The food looked good, though I didn't have anything. And the staff was quite friendly. I don't live close, but if I did, it's the kind of place that I would frequent. However, if I did frequent Kusanya, it would be, without exception, with newspaper, magazine, or book in hand. Here's the negative:Normally in 2018, non-working wifi (unless it is a one-time, unforeseeable disruption, as can happen to any business) knocks a review down to one star. But these guys are a non-profit and doing good work, so there's no need to ding them. Not for nothing, but they also have no reviews less than three stars, which is definitely something. Still, after a twenty-mile or so, meandering bike ride through some nasty, nasty construction zones and streets (screw you, Hyde Park!!!) with Kusanya as the ultimate goal, I can't say it didn't leave a bad taste when, after changing out of my sweat-soaked jersey, ordering a drink, settling in, and opening my laptop, I was treated to internet that wouldn't connect. Hopefully they fix that with their provider.","I think the cheese burgers are 10 out of 10! My whole family enjoyed our dinners! We're taking what's left home. That's how good it is! And graffiti on the table and walls and booths is allowed!- Leif, age 7","The mascarpone stuffed French toast was amazing!  To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of French toast. but I fell in love with their blueberry mascarpone stuffed brioche French toast!  the refreshing blueberry sauce and the delicious mascarpone taste like a perfect harmony. It took awhile for them to make the French toast. I was almost late waiting for it, since I woke up kind of late that day. But it was totally worth the wait! I'm craving for their French toast right now! I'm back in LA right now. really miss UChicago! Enjoy while you can ! I also loved the environment! I really like the seats both inside and outside with little green plants! The sunshine and plants makes a perfect start of a day! Taking away all me stress and replacing it with dangerous positive energy! Plein air cafe motivated me to get up to study there, before I go to class, while enjoying a cup of latte. The raspberry beignet was delightful and refreshing, when I don't feel like too much sweet or cheesy things.",I love this coffee shop because it's a nice place where I am able to get my work done when I want to get out the house. My only disappointment is that they are frequently out of chai tea when I visit in the afternoons. They also have a pretty good selection of sandwiches and small salads.I see based on other reviews I have to try the honey nut latte. I'll try on my next visit.
2,Cute cafe that made a nice strong cortado. Friendly staff and great looking sandwich menu,"Gaslight - the coffee shop designed for the everyday poet! I'm not kidding, this is probably the only coffee shop in chicago where you feel like you just want to write the book you always wanted to write. That's what their coffee will do to you - it'll make you creative with tons of inspiration flowing in your brain as you slowly drink their delicious coffee.The scenery is also very inviting and the staff are very kind and helpful. If you do come here, I strongly suggest you start with their latte. I've chosen to call it: the cheerful poet! Because you always feel like writing something cheerful as you drink it. :)","While this is a short walk from me and a cute interior, the coffee is pretty pricey and the staff is not very friendly. Gets pretty crowded during the day and minimal outlets are available.  With lots of coffee shops in the area, not my go-to spot.","Jacking'em up to a four star because at the end of the day i like them and real happy they're in my hood.Still question their level of hygiene. Last week went there twice. Both my dog and I liked what we got (he got croissants) ...Coffees reasonably good, and done nicely.Staff, very nice.Location fabulous.","I first heard about Volumes from a friend, then another friend, then another friend, and knew I had to go. It's a great bookstore/cafe, which really enhances the study vibe I was hoping for. They also have a whole section of Harry Potter themed drinks - I had the Molly Weasley which is AMAZING. The barista was super nice and patient as I spent 10 min trying to figure out the Ritual app (where you can pre-order items from different places around the city and get points) too.The space itself is also incredible. It's nice to be able to walk around and get inspired by all the books, plus the tables on the wall are high enough to do some standing work when you need to stretch. I will 100% be back! To try all of the other menu items as well as go to one of their many book-related/fun events!","I love this place!! My only complaint is that it's difficult to find a place to sit. All you 80s babies will get real nostalgia vibes from this place - from the decor, music and even the coffee titles. The coffee is able to match the cool ambiance. My personal favorite is the Peanut Butter Koopa-Troopa.. smooth and creamy peanut buttery goodness. It is in a cute area and there are some awesome thrift stores near by that are worth checking out!","If you are staying in Lincoln Park and you need an amazing but fast breakfast, you better be checking out The Bagelers Coffeehouse! I came here on Saturday morning for a quick bite and was absolutely blown away. I ordered the ""The Bageler"" which was a bacon, egg, and cheese with some fantastic chipotle mayo to go with it. This sandwich was a game changer, hands down the best breakfast sandwich I had in a long time (probably tied for one I had in New Orleans). The bacon was soft and crispy at the same time, the egg was tasty, and cheese was cheesy and good, and the bagels used were fantastic as well.This place was fantastic and I would absolutely love to come back on my next trip to Chicago. If you are in the area you owe it to yourself to come and give this place a try!","Bourgeois just means too rich for their britches. This place is a very quaint little joint to sit, sip a drink and feel special I guess. I bet hipsters love it.Did you know bourgeois really means MIDDLE class? Not even high class, but middle class materialistic. That's a pretty good description of this place. I feel like my reviews are all about my frugality (read: cheapness) and irritation with over-inflated prices. This review is no different.A breakfast bowl, iced chai latte and a scone cost me $20. *Does a Flintstones double take* TWENTY BUCKS for a la carte breakfast?!The berry scone looked pretty awesome, big and crusty with chunks of fruit...but it was the most bland hunk of flour and water I've had since eating motzo. The iced chai latte was decent but standard. Nothing wowed me about it except the $4.50 price tag (and not in the good way)The breakfast bowl was probably the best part but again nothing to write home about. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and the avocado was fresh, but the salsa, sour cream and onion were a bit unnecessary except to inflate the price. It was tasty but nothing I couldn't have made at home much cheaper. On a Saturday morning, there was ONE employee, who took orders and served people individually with absolutely no sense of urgency and zero multitasking skills. There were 5 people in line all standing around wondering if the place was really open.I will not be returning.","This cafe is very cute and crowded. It's super packed with people and laptops on the weekends so it makes it difficult to find a table. There's even a sign on the bathroom door designating people to leave room for diners but of course not everyone follows that. The main menus is just filled with drinks. You'll have to find the food menus either online or on paper pamphlets by the cashier. Once you order, the cashier asks if you are dining in or to-go. But dining in wise, they'll ask you where you're sitting. Didn't know I was supposed to pick a seat before ordering and considering the laptop crowd, this creates a slight challenge. On to the food -very good! I had the tuna sandwich and they put the tomato, lettuce, and pickles on the side. My friend had the butternut squash, and roast beef. Both pretty decent portions and she enjoyed both. The food came out fairly quickly and they cleaned the tables off quickly too. I wish the water cups were larger. Found myself having to get up multiple times to fill up an 5oz water glass.","Ok super annoyed with this place. Their coffee is fine not amazing not terrible.I'm giving them 2 stars because of their stale ass bread.  I gave them a free pass the first time it happened. I got a sandwich and the bread was clearly toasted in an attempt to hide the staleness of the bread.  Today I got a bagel and again it was hard and stale and absolutely disgusting.  Went straight to the trash.Thanks for ruining breakfast, Dollop.","The honey cinnamon latte is my favorite drink here. I recently got the Nutella mocha and was slightly disappointed by that one. It just wasn't as rich as I was hoping it to be. They also have some food options, such as sandwiches, bagels and pastries. It's a great place to just stay all day to do some simple work.I love that there is plentiful seating and many outlets for charging. The seats are a little bit uncomfortable, I have to admit. It is a little loud (with chatter and music), so maybe not the best place to go if you really want to concentrate. But it seems like a great place for group meetings, or if you like some buzz in the background while you work. I love the large windows, the bright and cozy feeling interior. It's also great that they still open until 7 even on weekends.","Excellent coffee, good atmosphere. Quality food.. what more does one want before they start the day:)Will be back. Thanks for great service","They literally converted a currency exchange into a pretty nice café. I like how they have healthy options and on this part of the south side I was surprised by the diversity of the clientele. I went with a friend for brunch and was blown away by what my friend called a ""biscuit"". It was dense and cake-like with a high polished top and it was divine! I would love to have another of whatever that was. There is also a check-in offer her for a free biscuit if you spend over $10 which is pretty easy to do. I thought it was affordable and the service was really good. I'd like to go back and try other items.Not so humbly submitted,Michael C.","Drinks: 4Cleanliness: 4Outlets: 4Noise Level: QuietWhat a perfect study spot in the neighborhood of Hyde Park! Came about 1-hr before closing and there was just 1 lady working. Super quiet, plenty of tables both high and low, and large windows for natural light. It's located within a common building in the back/middle.Would I come back? Yes, perfect place to do work.",First I'd like to say thank you to Kusanya for bringing such a super cool cafe to Englewood. Cafes like this are NEEDED within the community. With that said this was my second time visiting the cafe I hav family nearby and it's great to have the option to get good food and coffee nearby. Today I tried the oatmeal and it was really delicious not your traditional oatmeal it was baked oatmeal very yummy. I'll def be back and I'll get the oatmeal again. Prices are good customer service is excellent and the food taste good also.,"The space is really nice. The girl at the front desk really wasn't all that welcoming. We got a table upstairs which also has a patio for nice days. It's cozy upstairs. Me and my cousin shared a barbecue pizza and a garbage burger. The pizza looked really good but could have used more barbecue sauce and seasoning, it was lacking flavor but it was better than the burger even though it was a little dry. The garbage burger came with pickles even though I said no pickles. I'm not sure what kind of bun they used but it was stiff and cold, I ended up eating the burger with the lettuce instead of he bread. Again the burger didn't have any flavor so this place was definitely underwhelming.","*** Workspace ***Being a cafe in a university compound, there is plenty of seats with equal amount of outlets. However, this also means that it's quite crowded and stays bustling through the week.*** Coffee ***Solid selection of coffee that can be brewed in several methods. I always go for the cold brew or the drip.*** Food ***Snag a hazelnut beignet when you can! You won't regret it. I also love the pie here and for lunch option, the prosciutto with sweet balsamic sandwich is my go-to.*** Ambiance ***Adorably quaint! From the white interior to the outdoor seating surrounding a beautiful flower bed. If your Scandinavian grandmother decided to open a modernize yet charming cafe, it'll come out resembling Plen Air Cafe.","Robust is such a great space to work or meet up with friends.Food: I like to get the bacon, egg, and cheese on an English muffin. The first time I ordered it, I ate it so fast I forgot to take a picture. Lol. When I went back the second time, I remembered. They also have donuts and a variety of food (sandwiches, salads) you can order. Drinks: I enjoy their berry smoothie. The first time I went, I ordered the Honey Nut Latte. It was decent, but I prefer to go to Robust for the food and the space. Space: Robust is huge. There is a ton of space in the front and the back. You never feel too closed in next to someone  else. The cafe has nice big windows which lets in a lot of natural light. Service: the service is always good. The baristas and cashiers are always kind, and provide good service. I definitely recommend going to Robust. If I lived closer I would definitely be a regular."
3,"Good neighborhood place for breakfast sandwiches and nice place to sit for a while. The prices are bit high though, and it's difficult to find a spot on the regular because the space is small and customers park for a long time to use wifi.","It's good coffee but it's a little bit overpriced. We're in Logan Square, what can I say, if ya can't beat em, join em. The coffee is just well prepared at Gaslight, right down to the soda-water accompaniment.I've had many almond milk lattes and double espressos from here, and the water is the right temperature, and the milk is perfectly frothed (almond milk is notoriously difficult to froth amiright?).Just check it out and if you don't like it you don't have to come back. But they care, and so so I.","Good coffee, but slightly steep prices. This is definitely a coffee shop where you pay a bit more for quality and nicer ambiance. They're doing something right here because this place is continually busy and has a steady influx of customers coming in. Despite the busy atmosphere, this coffee shop is a well run ship and drinks are served quickly and tables are kept clean. You'll see a combo of studiers/people who linger here as well as people who just stop by for a quick drink. This cafe has nice big windows that lets in lot of natural light and the minimalistic table and chairs are just comfortable enough to get some work done without wanting to be here all day. There are also ample plugs all around the shop for those who need to recharge their laptops or cell phones. Again, this is set up in a great area and caters to multitude of people looking for a quick stop for coffee or looking for a busy coffee shop atmosphere to do some work. They also have a small outdoor seating area for those with pets or wanting to enjoy some fresh air with their coffee.","Nice coffee shop in the area. About a 5 minute walk from some great street art such as the Chicago wall and Robin Williams wall. They have a fun selection of drinks. The Nutella latte was delicious as expected, I just wish it had a bit more in flavor. The Ispento coffee however, was my favorite and has a slight kick that really jolts you to be awake. Decent prices around 4- 5 dollars and a small slection of pastries are available.","Super cute and modern neighborhood cafe & bookstore offering gifts and children's items too! The children's section is very well curated and offers a thoughtful selection of high-quality and unique books for all ages. I bought a beautiful children's art-collage book inspired by the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, ""Nietzsche in Shapes and Colors."" The blank journal and magazine selections were also impressive. Bright, tidy, warm and welcoming space.",This coffee shop is the MF bomb and I love it! I love the vibe here! Not sure if it's because it reminds me of Brady street coffee shops in MKE or if it's because it has that cool hipster vibe Bay View has but I dig it and I continuously find myself here whenever I'm in Wicker Park. They have a delicious latte called the Koopa Troopa that I highly recommend getting. I'll be back here for sure whenever I'm in the windy city. Give this place a try!,"Ugh love this place! It feels so random on the strip of closed stores and dental/eye businesses. I hope it doesn't lose business once the other stores open.  4 words = bourbon chai tea latte. Yup. Throw some soy milk in there and I'm done. They have good bagels and toppings, and really kind service! Plus, the booths and tables are warm and welcoming.","Quality of the Pig has decreased. Atmosphere remains super cool, although cleanliness is down (bathrooms can be gas-station gross, and the one has had the heat broken for a long time...).Drip coffee sometimes seems to have sat for a while, it served less hot, and while it's drinkable, I would no longer consider it comparable to the best coffee shops in the city (La Columbe, Dark Matter, Intelligenisa, etc)Service is also somehow shruggable. Staff aren't frustrating but certainly aren't out of their way helpful. The Pig is still one of the coolest spaces in the city, but I can't help think that if it had a bit more of its old inspiration, this place would be packed all the time.","I came in for breakfast with my friends on a Sunday at noon (about 7 of us). It is community seating, so tables are on a first come first serve seat yourself basis. Given that, it's still nicer than a Panera to have a sit down meal with friends. We were able to find a high top table for 8 without a problem. They have plenty of seating options for various group sizes. They also have a nice area for people visiting on their own working on their laptops. You place your order at the counter. The menu has a nice variety of options. My friend and I split two sandwiches, the avocado egg wrap and the bacon, egg and cheese croissant plus an order of hash browns. Everything was delicious!! I liked the avocado egg wrap for a half a sandwich but I'd be bored with the flavor after that, I feel it needs just a touch more flavor to it or a light spice/seasoning. The hash browns were cooked perfectly and were the perfect portion size. The croissant sandwich was very flavorful and you can tell everything was freshly made. They did have some issues serving our party of 7 at the same time even though we ordered right after one another. They apologized and made up for it which I appreciated so I hope they continue to work on faster delivery of food so tables can eat at the same time. The manager/owner was visible and asking people about their experience and the staff was very friendly. I'd definitely come back!","I had a very nice cortado here this morning, and the service was very friendly. I would definitely come back as it's a great location close to the theater district, and the space is very open and inviting - there is awesome natural light if you are into that :)","I happened to pass Dollop on my way to Yolk the other morning and it looked cool from the outside, bookmarking it because of the four-star average rating... but, sorry, can't agree with the overall assessment. The drip coffee:  Not anything out of the ordinary and not particularly strong. (The complimentary Illy dark roast being served in my hotel lobby was far better.)My banana nut muffin:  Looked enticing, but had a dense, gummy consistency with a bad mouth-feel.  The service: Aloof. Let me offer one word of advice - if you don't say hello or thank you, you also shouldn't put a payment screen in front of me asking for a tip. The plus is the tall open space, with seating you can hang out in for a while - but, otherwise, seems like Dollop could use an extra dollop of something.",Was in Chicago for a conference and went to Intelligista in the mornings for a coffee and pastry (3 visits).  I've been to other outlets mainly in Los Angeles and intelligista is one of my favorite specialty coffee chains.My rating is based on the following: Coffee: 4.5 starsCoffee beans: 3.5 starsService and atmosphere: 5 starsFood: 4 starsI tried the chocolate croissant as well as the ham and cheese pastry. Of the two I would recommend the ham and cheese pastry. I am a black coffee drinker and had the pour over with what ever beans they were brewing on hand that day.  During that time period it was mainly beans from the South American region. I prefer African beans with more acidity and fruit flavor to the smooth and nuttiness of a Columbian coffee. Coffee as in other locations was good and the staff is friendly and helpful with recommendations. Given I purchased beans both the Peru and Persephone blend.  Can't really recommend these beans. They aren't bad per say but nothing special and was a bit disappointed when I started using these at home.,"My friend and I decided to give Currency Exchange a try and I'm glad we did! We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed!!! They have musical entertainment from 1:00 to 4:00. It was such a welcoming environment and I loved the neighborhood bar feel.The place is huge!!! I heard soon they will be opening up for dinner as well. Now onto the food... :). I have to start by saying they have some of the best collard greens I have ever tasted. I'm also a huge fan of the black history month special menu item - SkunaBay Salmon + Sweet Corn Relish + potato Risotto. I took a slice of sweet potato pie with me and YUMMY! I love how reasonable the prices are and will definitely be back. Service, food, and hospitality of Executive Chef Lamar J Moore were excellent!","It's a Dollop so you essentially know what to expect.  Like the other locations, the drinks are solid, albeit a tad overpriced, but certainly a better option than habitually burned coffee at large name brand corporate coffee shop.  (rhymes with barlucks).  I had a latte and then later cappuccino.  The latte was very good, they had the right balance of milk and didn't leave you feeling heavy.  The cappuccino was great as well and the perfect boost in the afternoon.As noted by some others this isn't the coziest of dollops.  It definitely has a bit of a colder industrial feel to it.  Having said that, it's a large space in an area where the coffee shops tend to be a bit small and over crowded.  The plug situation needs some work and sometimes they've got the music cranked a little loud.","I loved walking into this coffee shop. It's in a good location, easy parking, free Wi-Fi, and great food selection. The cafe space is very open and comfortable and the bar is nicely designed out of reclaimed wood and doors( I think).The staff is great, polite, funny, engaging and offering great service. The food coffee and music are all top notch and if your even think you want the baked oatmeal, do it, don't skimp on the warm cream.Even though I was visiting from out of town, i felt welcome and like I was among friends. I can see why it's called ""Kusanya"" - bring together in Swahili.","I can't believe I haven't written a review about my beloved bakery! I have been going here since middle school. Back then I fell in love with their chocolate croissants and they're still yummy to this day. I really enjoy their coffee (hot and iced), and the Americanos. I also appreciate that they offer soy milk at no extra charge. Best of all of you buy 10 coffees and bring in the sleeves you get a free drink. Sitting is limited unless it's summer when they have outdoor seating.",Food: 4Service: 4Cleanliness: 4Noise Level: QuietHidden within UofC campus you'll find this cozy cafe offering bowls and sandwiches. Perfect place for a quick stop in or study sesh at individual or communal tables. You get a rustic meets European vibe by the decor. There is also a patio on warm mornings! Being here definitely takes you away from the city life.Tuna Salad Sandwich: all sandwiches come with a side of simple salad tossed in a balsalmic vinegrette. The sandwich itself was super filling. Tuna Salad tasted homemade and not doused in mayonnaise. Very light ! Street Parking out front.Wifi works great.Outlets along walls.Would I come back? Yes,So happy this gem is in my neighborhood. I've been coming here for about 3 years. I can enjoy Robust even when I'm working from home because they deliver! We love the breakfast sandwich and brisket grilled cheese.
4,Big fan of this place! Love the kahlo breakfast burrito. I also like the iced mocha and coldBrew,"Hands down one of my favorite coffee shops, ever. The baristas know their stuff, make a good cup of coffee, and are so nice. The decor is super cool too. It's a good place to get work done, read a book, or just people watch. They have a limited food menu, but it's all good! I recommend anything on it. If you're in the area, stop in, get an Americano, and enjoy what this shop has to offer.","Ah, 7 months after my Chicago trip and I'm finally doing a review on Intelligentsia.. whoops. My boyfriend and I arrived in Chicago around noon time from what I remember, but we weren't able to check into the airbnb till 3pm so he looked up this coffee place in order to kill time. And my boyfriend is a coffee nut so Intelligentsia interested him with the good reviews. Our Lyft driver dropped us off here and luckily the place wasn't packed with people so we were able to chill off to the side of the store with all our luggage. I ended up getting their matcha latte while my boyfriend opted for their coffee and we were able to use the free wifi offered here in order to look up more places to visit in Chicago. The people working here were friendly and didn't seem annoyed that we were dragging in hella baggage which I'm grateful for because it was a cold day and if they had kicked us out... well, damn. But they didn't so yay. My latte was a bit more bitter than what I was used to so I was a bit meh on it, but my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy their coffee. He even bought a few bags of their coffee bean when we went home to California, lol.","Really great vibes here! It's a great space with warm dark wooden finishes and lots of natural light- great for getting work done. The only thing to keep in mind is that it gets loud! They blast the music so it was a little hard for me to hear myself think, even though I usually love doing work at coffee shops. Aside from that, the coffee is great! I had an herbal-tasting latte with almond milk which was very good. They also have mini donuts! I usually don't like donuts at all but these were made from sweet potato and I had to try. I think the one I tried was orange with cardamom and it was super soft and a perfect texture. What's cool about ipsento is that it has a bar too! It's a great place to come hang or catch up with friends, but when it comes to working, only come if you're able to drown out loud sounds!","Volumes has easily become one of my favorite Chicago spots. They have both coffee AND books - two of my favorite things. The bookstore is not huge, but they have always had the books that I want and if they don't, they will order whatever book you'd like for you to pick up. At night, they have weekly and monthly events, including book clubs. Monday: Weekly Trivia @ 7:301st Wednesday: Open Mic @ 72nd Wednesday: Storytelling Series @ 7Last Wednesday: Ladies' Comedy Night @ 7:30Book Club categories include Book of the Month, Sci Fi, Feminist, and Trans & Gay and you can just show up for themThey also make good coffee - the oat milk honey latte that I had recently was to die for. There are usually tables and plugs available to work on your computer or read. Highly recommend this spot!",Wormhole is definitely a trendy/hipster modern day spot where they bring back memorabilia from the 80s. They even have a model size Back to the Future car and a old school Macintosh computer. They have alot of cool signature drinks on their menu. However - keeping with my standard - you have to try their hot black coffee or cold brew to determine if their coffee is on point. I opted for the cold brew since it was a hot summer day. I would have to say I am relatively disappointed. The cold brew fell really flat. No flavor whatsoever and way too much ice. Dissapointing. Cool coffee shop concept - need better coffee.,"Delicious. Warm, freshly made bagels and drinks. It was worth the wait in the long line for a cheap breakfast sandwich!","So I came to this establishment a lot, like everyday for two years, when I was studying. I wanted to support a local independent shop even if it wasn't great. But what i discovered was..well I honestly don't know where to begin... *They are ALWAYS out of everything- food items, chai, coffee, baked goods. I've been there three time when they were out of coffee! THREE TIMES!!*and the coffee they do use is Kirkland (Costco brand) LOL  I not a coffee snob but i don't want to pay $5 for costco coffee*Most of their food is microwaved because it is premade- eggs, paninis (which sometimes come out slimy )*the same pan of scones/muffins sit in the glass case thing for serious a week sometimes. The old mumbling baker just brings up a giant batch and they sit there until they are gone. By day 2 they aren't worth paying for. If I ask they have always been honest (""those were baked last monday"") so that's good at least. *still very expensive $$$ 15$ for a shitty sandwich that comes with a tiny bag of chips  *Plan on waiting 30 mins, over an hour if they are busy due to understaffing and what looks like severe lack of organization/operations. *Have to use your email for 3 hour internet access. Internet doesn't work at all many times. *The baristas are nice but clueless. They always have to check to see if they have what you order. I'm realizing it's probably not their fault though. *The filthy building (which used to be the selling point, and initially what i thought was cool) is crumbling due to lack of upkeep- thick layer of dirt over everything (the ceiling fans & vents are so disgusting), ceiling in the front room leaks BAD for over a year now when it rains or from snow melt (I've seen 5+ buckets to catch watch in the dining room)*I wish I could finish with something good, but after talking about this place I found out that it has a reputation for not paying it's employees. So I asked the two baristas - their reaction said it all - they just looked at each other with wide eyes & acknowledged the problem in a very polite way. More respectful to ownership than i would have been if there was uncertainty in my pay checks. * and end of story, I haven't gone back since. I would recommend anyone and their mother pass on this rotting shit hole in Lincoln Park. ***please see photos***","I came in around 8am on a Saturday to work. I'd never been before to ""dine in"", so I was excited to see why so many of my friends love coming here to get stuff done. This place got busy fast! By 9am on a rainy Saturday morning it was packed. The concept of an ""all day lounge"" is great, and as a non-coffee drinker I always feel obligated to get a coffee when I'm using a coffee shop for their space. I don't feel that way here because there are so many options here from food to drinks (including alcohol and pastries). My only gripe is food takes FOREVER to come out. Unless I order a coffee or a pastry from the counter by the register, I can expect to wait for my order. I waited once for a bagel to go and it took them 10 minutes to hand me my bagel and individual packet of Philadelphia cream cheese on a weekday morning when the place was pretty empty...Didn't really put me off, but heads up - on weekends you can only sit in the back at a few reserved tables if you'll be working on your laptop. So no window seats if that's what you wanted!","I work right in the building but I'm always here when there's a super long line so once I saw there wasn't a line then I went right in!I know of the design studio (Firebelly Design) who branded this shop so I was already in love with the aesthetic. I'm always on the search for coffee shops that offer great matcha. This one I can add to the list! They told me straight up that their matcha is unsweetened, but they have flavors that can sweeten the drink. There's a list by the cashier. I got ended up getting hazelnut. It was tasty.It's nice that there's unsweetened matcha so if I am not feeling like sugar then I can get it without sugar. There's tons of places whose matcha is too sweet and I need to drink some water after to clear the sweet taste from my mouth. I didn't get that here! So bonus!Overall, definitely worth going to!","This Chicago only quasi-small chain has some amazing coffees!  I indulged in an espresso and cold brew this morning and both were outstanding.  The baristas were super friendly and very knowledgeable.   They roast their own beans at another location, and it's noticeable.  Kudos Dollop!",Great latte. They don't have the super comfortable furniture probably to keep folks from sitting there all day. It's clean and in a good part of town. I would definitely make it a meeting spot if I were more local.,"This past Sunday; I had a need for some good food. I've heard so much about this place. I would see posting of live music, special events and great reviews on Facebook. To my surprise; the currency Exchange Cafe is located in the Washington park area. I didn't realize how close this place was to my home.  It's centrally close to the highway, red line, Garfield transit line, Hyde Park and Woodlawn. It's great to see that they employed young people. The staff are wonderful. The place is beautiful. I love rustic look. It has two levels. You're able to eat at bar, booth and great seated table throughout. Visiting the currency Exchange Cafe gives that #Throwback vibe. The music is old school, jazz, neo soul. Great place for working , meeting with Old & new friends and eating good. I will definitely come back. I came back the next day for the Monday live jazz event.  I loved it.  First drink IWith a ticket is free ( soft drink, wine, beer, chai)Please tip the bartender.. great service","Not the best Dollop location, but it'll do. I only like it because it's convenient and fairly spacious but otherwise I wouldn't come here. The seating isn't very comfortable and while there are outlets available, I feel like there aren't enough. The whole place gives a very ""cold"" feel. I usually prefer coffee shops that are more cozy and warm. There are definitely other Dollop locations that have that nice ambience but I'm not quite sure what they were thinking with this one. There is a pretty good amount of space available and it is less crowded than some other cafes on campus, probably due to its tucked away location.","I am pleased with my visit here, very kind staff and great taste coffee options.  Order a coffee to go and check out the sleeve: Brewed In Englewood. Way better than that watered down crud Starbucks sells. The atmosphere is usually very upbeat and trendy. A lot of vegan sandwich options, which is a bit problem for me!","Fell in love after we ordered some pizza from here for a group event. Decided to come to the actual location and wasn't disappointed either! Definitely a good place to check out if you're in Hyde Park.They have a smaller take-out only cafe-type location that is just a few doors down from the restaurant. I love the super rustic feel of the place. They have these wooden booths and exposed brick walls which both gave a very loft-like cozy feel to the restaurant. Really gives the place a nice charm, which really matters to me! There are a lot of families here and students as well which gives the place a nice buzz. I dislike going into a super empty restaurant. For two, we ordered a calamari appetizer and two personal sized pizzas, which was just enough food. I absolutely love their margherita pizza. We also got the roasted veggie pizza which was pretty delicious as well. I've also tried the BBQ chicken pizza and the garbage pizza and those are yummy too! I'm not a big fan of goat cheese, but my friends have told me they like that one too. Basically, you can't really go wrong with the pizza here. The bathroom situation is confusing! It's one door that leads to another room with a sink and separate men and ladies rooms on the side. I was hesitant to walk in out of fear that I would be walking in on someone or going into the wrong one but do not worry!","Two cafes in one morning, my goodness! But after finding  a good tea for myself we were on a quest to find a coffee worth it's wait for the coffee lovers in our family. This place was another yelp find and the yelp gods did not disappoint. Plein Air Cafe & Eatery had so much character and their menu of not just drinks but food were to die for. They had everything from croissants and danishes to fresh salads and sandwiches, everybody was able to find something to cater to their tastebuds here.I don't know if being close to a university helps but service here too was immaculate. And the croissants were out of this world.","Let's spend a second dreaming about that Honey Nut Latte. HOLY DELICIOUS! Who knew coffee, almond milk and honey could be so perfect?! I will say, it is a bit pricey at almost $5.50, but as a VERY occasional treat, 100% worth it! While I was there I also (calorically, not monetarily) splurged on an amazing double chocolate cake donut. I had to remind myself that I was in public and need not inhale it. Their drinks and sweets are so on point at Robust. Pro-tip: Between 6am-8am all food is 50%!The only downfall is not everyone that works there is kind or efficient. They typically have one person working cash register (and serving simple black coffee) and one person making all of the other drinks, so if you snoozed, you're losing, because you might be 10th in line even at 7:30am! .... totally worth it though for that honey nut latte and donut :)"
5,"Great way to cool down after a walk along 606 is to have an iced tea from Gallery Cafe. Their staff is cheerful and helpful, the artistic and laid back vibe also adds to the charm of the place. Free wifi and they hold events.","This is the best coffee shop in Logan Square, hands down. Great coffee, the staff is genuine and wonderful, and the kitchen is a hidden gem of delicious offerings. Anyone who shits on gaslight is either pretentious or just self consciously projecting their woes into the place. It's the best.","My old review needs an update.  Service speed has improved dramatically over time, which was a major gripe.  Service is usually pretty friendly, and I do like the layout of the store.  But seats aren't very kind to your tush, so don't plan to camp out too long. The outdoor space that the city plopped on Milwaukee is pretty cool and is a nice place to camp out when the weather is nice.Coffee and pastries are good.  For sure a step up from Starbucks, but coffee is definitely not in the top 3 in the city. If you are feeling decadent, have the milkshake.  Its out of this world.","You know that you have some of the most special beans and brews in The City of Chicago when I have to stop for one of your signature lattes just because it makes my day so so special. I wish I didn't live on the other side of the 606 trail, but that's my way of saying bring your coffee north of Lawrence Ave.","My bookstore/cafe in Wicker Park. Love this place. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Cafe items are great! Wish they had more sales or a discount program better than save 10 when you spend 100, but 10% off is better than nothing. And as a graphic novel guy, I wish their selection was a bit bigger, but still...very cool place in a great neighborhood.Free WiFi.","Edgy coffee shop! Great music, knowledgeable baristas, and fast service! It has a lot of nostalgia in terms of 80's and 90's movie memorabilia! Ghostbusters, Gremlins, Aliens and more! I got my iced soy chai latte: I was impressed! 5 stars! There is ample seating inside and plugs for all your devices to charge! There is also outdoor seating as well. This will be my office for the morning!",These bagels will bring a tear to your eye they are so delicious. Went on a Saturday and had to go back on Sunday for another round. The sea salt bagel and everything bagel with their smoked salmon cream cheese are where it's at. The long line is so worth the wait! Can't wait to try more of their amazing menu.,Awful. Dusty. Panini was distasteful. Waste of my hard earned money. Mood was morbid. Would never recommend this place to anyone unless you are looking for a place to go after a funeral.,"Short and sweet review. Came here on Saturday evening for coffee while waiting on some friends. Excellent service, excellent prices (especially for the area), and a fun spot to have a cup of coffee or tea.","Dollop is an order at the counter coffee-shop with multiple locations south of the river in downtown Chicago. There are many coffee options including drips, pour-overs and an Impressive tea collection as well.I had a drip coffee which was bold enough, though I still haven't had my fantasy dark, bold, non-acidic, not too bright coffee in Chicago.My wife had the green jasmine tea which compared to the one she had yesterday which had a more jasmine/floral presence, this one was heavy on the green and not so much on the jasmine / floral. She remarked she could have just ordered a ""green tea"".They have Vegetarian quiche available (which excite me) along with a veggie dandwich, and a Brie Sandwich with fig jam (also enticing to me a s vegetarian), but with biscuits on the menu, that's automatically the direction I default to. I had the egg and cheddar biscuit. I asked if they could make it with egg whites and they said ""no"", they get the eggs this way so it was a bit disappointing to me to learn the food was essentially not made to order. It also tasted a bit-reheated which is kind of obvious to tell with biscuits. It was also too hot when I received it...the cheddar cheese on it was over-melted and didn't have much of a taste. It tasted like I was getting biscuit and egg. Cheddar on a biscuit should be not quite so melted so the cheddar flavor shines through.I'd give the place another try if I'm back in Chicago...but with so many options downtown it wouldn't be top on the go-to list.","My new favorite spot to get things done!Dollop's bright and airy interior has made this my new favorite place to get things done on my laptop. There are tables, a couple comfy chairs, and a high top bar along the window. I was a little thrown off by the WiFi asking for a password, but the password is listed on a very small sign by where you pick up your drinks. As for the coffee, it's a little too strong for my tastes. I got the honey cinnamon latte so many other people have raved about, and after one sip I was like WHOA coffee! But if you're a big coffee lover, totally check this place out. Or if you're nearby and looking for a place to work for a few hours, Dollop is a million times better than all the neighborhood's Starbucks.","Stopped by after coming in on the train, looking for some yummy coffee to warm me up. This place delivered! The art on my mocha was beautiful and the mocha tasted delicious! The taste is a perfect balance between chocolate and coffee!","Currency Exchange Cafe is a great place to grab a coffee, connect to free WiFi and plow through some work. It's a pretty chill vibe with a steady flow of patrons, but not too distracting. Although I've never had rude service, the staff could be friendlier. The Matcha Green Tea Latte is my go-to. I love CEC's active community involvement. Check them out especially if you're like me (self diagnosed ADHD) and can't focus at home.","This shop is located in a building on UC's campus. Unless you are familiar with the Northside of UC (Smart Museum, Young Building etc) you probably aren't going to find it.As with most Dollops, speed isn't high on the list of priorities. True, everything is handcrafted, in true barista fashion only one drink is made at a time and there is (unimaginative) latte art created. So with that being said, if you are getting coffee/espresso on your way to class or a meeting, make sure you make time for the process. The decor is super industrial which is cute, but Dollop still manages to have a messy lobby/cafe space. Not sure if it's due to students studying or being lazy with their belongings, but it manages to look disheveled.Also, the food for what you get is extremely over priced. There is a small reach in and panini press; it looks like everything is slapped together by hand, so maybe it's priced so high to dissuade people from ordering? I wish Dollop would partner with Goddess and the Baker grocer for RTE items and pastries. Especially in this type of environment I would think that Grab and Go options would be super popular and efficient. But what do I know?All in all, it's a nice addition to UC and maybe Hyde Park (if they had the right signage).",Great place! Saw this on a PBS special one night at work so me and my daughter checked it out. I had The Big Payback and my daughter had The Bernie Mac N Cheese. Excellent! She said it was the best thing she ever had which is a big deal for her. This place is a gem and I hope to see more pop up! Will be coming back.,"Ugh. I so don't like the Med. People love to say it's a Hyde Park institution, but honestly, the food is so mediocre. I will say the Med Deli is pretty good for a quick sandwich to and from campus, but the sit-down options at the Med are just so bleh. The grilled cheese, the quesadillas, pizza, etc. are just fine, and they end up being kind of expensive with tip and tax (easily a $15 meal.) I always say I'd rather spend the extra few dollars and get some pasta/pizza from Nella. The milkshakes are good though, if you want a sugar bomb to treat yourself, and the patio upstairs in the summer is really a nice space.","I like Plein Air Cafe and Eatery. I really do. The kitchen turns out simple, yet tasty food. The biscuits and housemade jams are exceptional. Baristas pull espresso shots with the best of them and the mochas are delicious. I've missed on a few food items, but overall they serve above average cafe, breakfast and brunch options.My main gripe is the dining area service. It's kind of odd because the cashier counter is always friendly. They're patient even when the line winds out of the door. My problem is with the table bussers. Each time I've been they've removed either a plate, cup or menu without uttering a single word. It's so shocking and quick that I've barely been able to get their attention to return. It would be nice if they'd ask before swiping my grub or anything else sitting in front of me. .. especially frustrating because the food is a bit overpriced.",Cute little shop in Hyde Park. I ordered a croissant and coffee which I really enjoyed. Inside looks really trendy for anyone that cares about aesthetics. Check this place out if you haven't.
6,Superb little cafe. Great atmosphere and the Kahlo breakfast burrito (add sausage) is amazing! Will be back to try more of their breakfast and lunch offerings.,"Over the years they have fine tuned a lot.  At some points their food is downright gourmet.   Sadly, they got rid of their pour-over which is one of the reasons i went there.  Also, I did have a rude an unfortunate situation with one of the owners.  Overall the place is still good, but i can't say that the people behind it are that great.","So apparently Intelligentsia is all the rage and I had no idea there was one 2 blocks from my apartment (I think paying for coffee is stupid). We were walking to the Starbucks on Division and my boyfriend stopped dead in his tracks when he saw there was an Intelligentsia. His drink: Mocha Latte with a cute heart shaped pattern thing (whatever that is called)My drink: Chi LatteVote: His was better right off the bat. I didn't care much for mine so I stuck it in the fridge and it was GREAT as a cold latte (I tend to like my caffeine cold anyway)Consensus: Maybe I'll be back but again, I have a hard time justifying paying $5 for a coffee when I have my k cups at home. This is no dig on the establishment just not really my thing. But this place is ALWAYS busy which means they are doing something right.","Ipsento has great coffee with creative latte options and AMAZING mini donuts. The staff was really nice and it has a chill atmosphere. I brought my laptop to do some work on a Sunday afternoon where it was really packed. There is limited seating where I had to wait a little bit before I was able to sit at a table.I ordered the rose cardamom latte and half a dozen mini donuts. I want to be able to tell you what my favorite flavor donut was but each one was just so good. The latte? So good. A part of me wants to be fancy and be able to describe the amazing aroma/delicious flavors but you know what? Unnecessary because it was just so. very. good. You just need to try it for yourself. I highly, highly recommend this coffee shop and I am definitely coming back.",Came here to do some work on a weekday and was happy with my choice. Cool bookstore to browse through with unique books and gifts available. The vanilla latte was delicious and the chocolate with peanuts muffin went well despite it being a bit dry. Such a great find; definitely planning to return,"This place has plenty of character, and at least a few unique options for coffee drinks. I had the 'Cool But Rude' and it delivered a pleasantly memorable coffee experience with strong hints of ginger and curry sauce. Health concerns aside, the overall taste was better with whole milk versus skim milk.It's also worthy to note that the decor inside the place was fantastic for any vintage 1980's fan. From the DeLorean from Back to the Future to the original Game Boy to an original Apple computer, there are plenty of bits of eye candy. Overall, I'd certainly recommend trying this place at least once.","I feel like Yelp led my astray on the Bagelers Coffeehouse.  It's a perfectly OK establishment, but this neighborhood has so many more exciting options.  I do not understand the near perfect rating for an average and slightly over-priced meal.I came to Bagelers for a breakfast sandwich ($6.19 post tax), which came with egg, bacon, and Muenster on an everything bagel.  The everything bagel so too salty, and the seasoning mix was not quite right.  The bagel was not the best either, and it is similar quality to what you would get from a grocery store bakery.  The egg, bacon, and cheese was all OK, but this is about the same quality of a breakfast as you would get from a Panera Bread.  I had hoped for more from a local establishment.There were lots of people working on the free wifi so it may be more of a place you work and can eat/drink coffee.",Terrible experience. Waited almost an hour for mediocre food. My lunch partners' food took an additional 30 minutes. Staff was unhelpful. Would not recommend this spot and will not be back.,"This review is after a single visit on a Saturday that had a temperature high of 96 degrees and the city was hosting Lollapalooza, so it might not have been the best time for them to provide their best service. I was there with a group that included 4 adults and 3 kids. We were given the high table at the entrance with no back- bar chairs which really wasn't the best chairs for the kids to sit properly. I'm not sure if they have high chairs for children as none were provided. They have a very simple, easy to follow menu (with calories listed as well). We went ahead and ordered upfront, and once the food was ready, they dropped them off at the table. Food was average at best. I got their Country Benedict which wasn't presented as I'm used to at other places. The poached eggs on buttermilk biscuits were placed in a bowl of pork sausage gravy. I'm used to having a crispy base for my poached eggs, but such was not the case here. It was very hard to separate the taste as everything was mixed together in a bowl or gravy. My wife ordered the Midwestern omelette that was made with ham, bacon, Wisconsin sharp cheddar, and a side of hash browns. I tried her omelette which was alright, but her hash browns were bland and void of any seasoning. The wait for own food wasn't long at all, but the quality was underwhelming from my end. I can see this place having an eclectic charm, but it just did not fit my needs.","The cold brew is amazing! Service is friendly with a smile and the sandwiches are fast, tasty and on fleek. It gets very crowded but is totally expected for this area. I seen the staff handle crowded situations in which I would have died. Excellent job all around! The coffee comes out faster than this Yelp review is posting ATM haha",This is my go to spot for quick work meeting. I always get the honey cinnamon latte with a little less honey otherwise its too sweet for my liking. It's the perfect afternoon pick me up. It's a little pricey but it's comparable to other places in the area.,"TLDR: Was great for a quick coffee._______Waiting for breakfast a block away dropped in here for a coffee while I waitedI'm basic, so I always go with a vanilla latte. I actually forgot to add vanilla to it and they were kind enough to add it later and didn't up charge me. Super cool of them. I think they make the vanilla in house - it was a super good and well done latte.Nice wooden shelves (bar) with wooden stools. Cool decor. They had really cool art . The posters were like a maze where you have a start and finish and also snapshots of famous sites around town.",One of the coolest & coziest places I've been in Chicago. I could spend all day here reading a book or working on some work. I HIGHLY recommend the drink called Green Goddess & for food the Shrimp & Grits or Spicy Chicken. If you live downtown or on the North side this is a must visit on the South Side!,"What a great coffee shop! Large, well-lit, and airy, it has a lovely ambiance. Seating was plentiful, as were outlets. WiFi worked with no issues. The noise level was minimal but it didn't feel too quiet. I had an amazing sandwich and also a hot drink. Both were tasty and not too expensive. The clientele is mostly UChicago students, so there's definitely a young vibe. Everything was clean and tidy. The baristas were friendly as well. This is one of my new favorite places!","I FINALLY made out into this awesome space. Tried before but my timing was off. They weren't open...Well, today was a stumbled-upon kind of day.... So very happy I came! First visit... VERY AWESOME COFFEE! I mean DEEElicious !! They said they roast their own beans in house!Um... Guess I never Submitted first review... So... 2 weeks later I was wanting that delicious roasty flavor... Got it for free! They have a Pay-It-Forward program! Sometimes your drink is in the last person! It's  LOVE! So, I bought a brownie.... Just to taste & give away (diet), but bit they are really special brownies... Wish wish wish I could inhale the Whole gooey thing. DON'T MUST OUT ON KUSANYA quiet spacious clean friendly chill deco good","From walking in the door to when I got up from the booth to leave, I think I  must have aged 2 years. For an off night, I am not sure why the wait was close to 30-40 minutes for a party of 2. What is most frustrating is that we were quoted 15-20 minute wait. Their patio and balcony seating were not open that night.Even after being seated, we waited for 20 minutes before our waiter even came by our table at all. When he did make his first appearance, he had the exaggerated brow-wiping-looking-super-tired-from-how-busy-it-is thing going, which frankly made it slightly more irritating since now we were almost an hour committed at this place and I was only able to sip on some water. I had heard that the thin crust pizzas were awesome, and not being a fan of the Chicago deep dish, I figured I would try the roasted veggies thin crust in personal pizza size. My sister got the Smoky Joe sandwich with fries. I will say that the portions are generous and I liked the shoe string fries on my sister's dish (but I guess who wouldn't). Otherwise, I was super disappointed that my pizza was not thin crust at all, in fact, it was super bready and felt fairly flavorless. Being fed up with our dinner experience, we went next door to their bakery to see if maybe grabbing a pastry after could salvage our impression of Medici and of course since the whole dining experience took so long, they were sold out of most things in their case, so we left empty handed.","Beautiful little cafe on a more beautiful campus right next door to The Robie House!  Who cares what the food tastes like right?  I wouldn't expect to stop here for lunch with the family and sit down at a table/ not happening!  PACKED all the time with students with their Macbook Pro's opened up next to iphones & cups of coffee I think is the best description.  I mean I'm all about technology but what about an actual conversation?  As far as the food goes... I feel like the sandwiches always sound better in description than they actually taste/ lots of bread.  The bowls on the other hand are EXCELLENT!! (Chicken Jalapeno Bowl)  The menu in pretty extensive given the size of this joint & they offer breakfast items until 12; Sandwiches & Bowls, etc after that.  They have great coffee and all kinds of espresso drinks as well as some very good dessert items...including beignets!!  Prices a tad on the high side but as far as Hyde Park goes this is your best bet by far for lunch, trust me.  Not sure what others are talking about but the staff was very nice, probably the owner at the register even facilitating orders to customers!  Talk later","Stopped in because need a pick me up. Their speciality is the mocha diablo..it is espresso, milk and the in house diablo syrup. I did almond milk instead of regular milk. I will say that the Diablo is the bomb! It's the right hint of spicy and also not too sweet. They also have an assortment of pastries but I didn't try any..if you want a cute little coffee shop I think Robust will provide."
7,"Honestly, I'm surprised by the reviews. I typically only order plain coffee at coffee shops. This time was no different, so I can't speak to their specialty drinks. However, the dark roast drip coffee was superb.Some coffee shops are pretentious. The Gallery Cafe isn't one of them. It's a chill, cozy environment. Good energy. The staff was attentive. When I walked in, I was asked to wait for a moment. I didn't mind. I appreciated the communication. The staff member who waited on me was a quirky guy. I'm a little quirky, too. Great! The menu said that high fives were free with purchase. I wasn't going to pass up that opportunity. I paid, then asked the barista for my high five. He completely understood and proceeded to lift his hand about head height. I then proceeded through with a high five motion. I think it was a good high five. I can't speak for the barista's experience. The price was fair. I sat in the shop so I went ahead and paid for a coffee refill with my original purchase. The barista applauded my proactive method which made me feel like I could really tackle the day. Thanks for that.Overall, good experience. I was pleasantly surprised but not necessarily wowed. The tile floor and bathroom decor could use an update, but hey, the energy was on fleek. Thank you Gallery Cafe. You made my day a little better. I'll return the favor my donating a high five to someone in need.","Came here to get some work done after an online article recommended it. Cheap coffee, definitely hipster, and good for work if you don't need WiFi. WiFi is horrible.",I'm not a coffee drinker so my review might be a bit skewed since it's a coffeeshop. Instead of coffee I got a match latte which was gorgeous but the flavor was a lacking. It wasn't that sweet and an almost overpowering matcha taste which gave it a bitter aftertaste. I did end up drinking it all because it cost $6.  The place itself is very cute however. Great for getting some work done with big windows that let in a lot of natural light. It's smaller and quieter like most coffee shops and despite the latte I would definitely come again!,"Being a fresh meat in chi city, I was the classic hipster looking for the best coffee in the city. I was so happy to found Ipsento 606.Amazing selection of coffee - each cup stands up for itself and there is a wide variety of good coffee.*) The nutella latte had the perfect amount of nutella sweetness without overpowering the taste of coffee.*) The ipsento latte is no standard latte. I love that they spiked it with spices for a unique kick.*) Cold brew is my go to work coffee and Ipsento's did not disappoint. It's refreshing with the perfect amount of acidity - just perfect for my taste.I have to give honorable mention to their donuts. They are in adorable mini size, with the perfect amount of sweetness. My favorites are the earl grey and maple donuts.I live on the opposite side of Ipsento, but because they are the kind of coffee shop that are equipped with both the love of coffee and the passion for community, I can't help but to find an excuse to swing by.",Raspberry mocha coffee drink with a ton of beautiful books around me. Love this place and the service is so nice!,"Easily one of my favorite spots to get work done. If you order a tea, they prepare it with loose leaf tea, and provide a free additional steep if you'd like. Not a bad spot to hang out, but most of the people here seem to be getting work done. Dimly lit so if you're not next to a lamp, I could see it being difficult to read if you're bringing a book here in the evening. Employees are friendly as well.","Super cute place! The decor and the atmosphere is so welcoming. Mostly full of college students so the wifi is excellent and the outlets are plently. However, the turnover rate is pretry low so if you see a table CLAIM IT. They don't have a large area but they do the best with what they got. Every table has beautiful local flowers on them. As for the food, WONDERFUL. I got the everything bagel gardener sandwich and I was a huge fan. It was easily in my top 5 of bagels. Would definitely come here again, but know the line gets pretty long during rush times and you will have a wait (but oh god it's worth it). Also their lattes have the cutest art. 5/5 will be returning","Absolute gem of a spot located in Lincoln Park right by De Paul's campus. We searched the area for a good sandwich spot that wasn't too chain-esque and this place caught our eyes instantly. It is a small duplex that, on the left side, has a small food shop that has a diverse array of sandwiches and salads that are great for both meat eaters and vegetarians. On the right side is a small coffee and tea shop that smells of delicious aromas from the fresh brewed drinks. Food: My girlfriend is a vegetarian but was in the mood for a sandwich instead of a soup or salad. She created a delicious build-your-own-sandwich with greens and a variety of cheeses on sourdough bread. It came out steaming and gooey while not sloppy; the bread was pressed and crispy on the outside yet softer as it approached the cheesy center. I ordered the Great Gatsby sandwich which was at the top of the best sellers list and I can completely see why. The sandwich came out piping hot with a mixtures of mouth watering smells ranging from the bite of the Swiss to the juiciness of the turkey and bacon. The basil pesto was an incredible touch and the avocado added that California club taste to it. I would highly recommend this sandwich the way it comes as it was absolutely divine.  Atmosphere: The restaurant itself was a cool, old school home feel that made the experience that much better. There were students working on papers and research while enjoying the sunshine and coziness of the dining area. While there is not much seating inside, it feels like an escape to a comfortable home that also serves up delicious food. Consensus: The mouth-watering sandwiches and plentiful salads and soups makes this place a definite stop every time I'm in Lincoln Park. The cozy home feeling of the dining area mixed with the great staff adds to the all around wonderful food this place has to offer!",Great place to atmosphere is absolutely amazing you sit down in a beautiful place enjoy your delicious drink very very very nice and clean environment the staff is what makes this place so wonderful you're so welcome Hank very professional they simply do what you want quick and nice with no hassle the food is really delicious they don't have great variety but whatever they have they do it well and it takes very good you should try the orange juice the mocha dice coffee as for the desert the absolutely best thing they have is the chocolate mousse I think it's what it's called easily it's on the top shelf of the food of the best pastriesAnd precious items the shrooms on Bluetooth is the best also been told from my family that the excellence is really good,Great coffee. Loved that I could have an almond milk latte! But no bathroom!? In a coffee place?,"This cafe came CLUTCH. I flew into Chicago on a workday at 7 in the morning. Was stuck in a Lyft for 1 hour on back to back conference calls. After dropping my luggage off at our hotel, my fiance and I walked a couple of blocks down and came across this place.We were tired, hungry, and desperately needed a place to plug in for work. This place met all the criteria. The vibe was a bit slow, which I needed. The coffee amazing. Service was awesome - the baristas were cool and dressed so cute! And the food was amazing (every sandwich comes with a pickle and a really yummy potato salad).Lastly, the internet connection was seamless. Im happy my fiance recommended this place. Super happy we came here.","I think the staff are really nice and knowledgeable. That brought me from a 3 Star to 4 Star experience. I had the La Tortuga, which was smooth and not too acidic. Almost a hint of chocolate taste? I could be totally wrong, but it's what I personally taste. Was it phenomenal? Not really... Would I come back? Maybe if I was in the area and needed a casual coffee fix. It's a chic place with a nice ambiance.","I really love Currency Exchange Cafe (CEX). No matter how much I get angry at their slow service, or their forgetting to give me this or that, or for having to remind people several times to wipe off my table after the previous guests have long gone, I just keep coming back.This morning, I arrived right after they opened and the house was already full with a long ordering line, which was moving slowly as usual. They only have one person taking orders at the walk-up counter, and it is not uncommon for him or her to discuss menu items in great detail, socialize with guests, or host conversations with the barista or other servers who frequently gather behind the bar. In this way, I guess, the good vibe of the place is created. With every kind of soul music playing loudly in the background and all sorts of happy POC eating and laughing at individual and communal tables, it feels like home as soon as you walk through the door. And it smells like your mama has been in the back cooking all day and all your cousins and mama's friends and uncles are already there and having a good time. It's warm, cozy, and the workers have nappy hair, funky haircuts, and Goodwill clothes accentuated by trendy sneakers and Wakanda-type shyt. Look to your left and see piping hot plates of pancakes and French toast with whipped cream and berries pass by as quickly as steaming soul bowls heaped high with fragrant collard greens peeking out from underneath over easy eggs. You stand in that fcuking line and wait because it's worth it when they do the shyt right.I order the honey latte every time I come, and it is made with love each and every time. It is the perfect balance of sweet, creamy espresso and heavenly foam with a touch of honey in the bottom of every cup. My favorite barista, the girl with the locs and big glasses, is not much for small talk. Each time I visit, I just thankfully retrieve my perfect latte when she yells out my name. Today, they never called out my name, so I had to go up and ask for my latte well after I'd already eaten most of my food. The food was so good, I didn't really want to get up, but they had also forgotten my biscuit and I wanted to see what it tasted like with my soul bowl (scrambled eggs, juicy collards, and bacon pieces heaped on top of hot, fried potatoes). When I asked about my latte and missing biscuit, the worker performed astonishment. He paused, looked at his iPad screen in shock, and said to me, ""I don't know HOW that happened."" [Long pause that didn't include an apology] ""We will get that right out to you, mam.""It was my turn to pause because I wanted to cuss at him for faking. Instead, I said, ""And the biscuit?""""Yes, mam. And the biscuit.""I walked back to my table, where earlier, before my food came, instead of a latte, another server had placed a small sign on my table that read ""Reserved @12:45."" Like Beyonce said at Coachella, ain't that a bytch? At that time, it was barely 10:15, and they were signaling for me to leave before my table even got wiped down. Whatever.I sat back down and waited for my biscuit. The same boy I had reminded to bring it when he brought my food and promised to ""be right back,"" showed up after a few minutes with a piping hot biscuit on a saucer. I was disproportionately happy when it came and thought, well at least it just came out of the oven. That must have been the hold-up. I happily ate it and soon, my latte arrived too, with a beautiful heart shape floating in the foam. I like to think it was to make up for being so late. I paused to work on an essay I had been writing, but when I went back to my biscuit a few minutes later, why was the MF hard as a ROCK!?!? Well, if you know like I know, then you know the only time that happens is when BREAD HAS BEEN MICROWAVED! No wonder it was piping hot! Why, oh, why they wanna play with me like this? I am so greedy that I ate it anyway, mad as could be. Almost choked on it. It made a huge ball in my right cheek and took forever to wash down. I put some greens in my mouth to soften it up, gave up on my essay, and decided it was time to write this review. With just a few minor tweaks, mainly in service training and closer attention to the high volume CEX continues to see, it can be the rockstar dining experience it's supposed to be. Bus and wipe the tables down quicker. Make servers carry tickets to ensure diners receive their FULL orders at once. Come up with a better system for delivering drinks. And for god's sake, open up another ordering line! CEX has mastered an aesthetic, as is evidenced by the crowd and by its fun SM presence. It has found a way to appeal to every kind of community member close to our beloved South Side. And there is something for everybody at CEX, but service must improve. The least CEX could do is make sure everyone has what they need, on clean tables, after they have pre-paid good money for their good food.","I've been to a few dollops around Chicago and this one is probably my least favorite. Like any coffee shop, there's is some variance in quality based on who's making the drink, but this is the only dollop where I have felt like I was regularly overpaying for what I was getting. This location is regularly out of certain drinks and sometimes milk (almond, oat - although a lot of coffee shops struggle to keep oat milk in stock so this ones not their fault). I usually order a cappuccino and somehow the espresso often tastes burned and sometimes they don't froth the milk enough. My latest drink was almost at the same quality as McDonalds or Starbucks. The espresso was incredibly bitter/burnt tasting and the texture was too watery for a proper cappuccino.  I will say, for what is close to campus, this place is one of the best, but it is nowhere near the level of quality of most Dollops or other similar chain coffee shops in the city (La Colombe, Intelligentsia).","This place is lovely!  I came in with some coworkers and really enjoyed my iced caramel latte.  The prices are fair, the ambiance is comfy and inviting, and the staff is friendly.  I will certainly be back.","We were working at 57th st Art Festival last Sat & Sun. I found here at Deliciousness MEDICI coffeehouse and Bakery and got Dirty Spicy Chai Coffee, Spinach and feta pastries, apple pastries, cinnamon rolls, chocolate chips pastries. All pastries were so yummy and rich tastes.Big chunks of apples, spinach & feta cheese pastries so delicious and all pastries are good size. Dirty spicy chai was tasty too. It was so helpful place to get any meals and close by our booth. I used restroom too. Thanks I will try some more next visit!","Plein Air is a great surprise on a beautiful campus. Though the front area is currently under construction, walking into the cafe (the cafe is on the right, the bookstore on the left) I was immediately struck by how bright, clean, and modern the place is. It's not super large and the majority of the seating is at long tables or a long bar overlooking Robie House next door. I wouldn't say the place is especially kid friendly, because most of the seating is at bar style stools or chairs and I didn't see any high chairs around. However, if you came at an off peak time and could sit at a table it would be a great place for a kid.The menu is pretty extensive, note that they stop serving the plein bowls and tartines after 3 pm.I love that they serve Topo Chico, I don't see that much outside of Texas. They also have fresh squeezed grapefruit and orange juice in their cooler.I was hungry, but not for a full blown meal so I got the soup of the day, tomato basil. I was very disappointed by the quality of the tomato basil soup, it tasted like they opened a bottle of tomato sauce from the store and poured it into a bowl. Furthermore, the soup itself wasn't even hot, it was tepid at best even though it took the employees about 10 minutes to bring it to me. The French bread on the side was also stale. I really enjoy tomato basil soup, but there was absolutely no complexity or dimension to the soup, I didn't taste any basil, just cold tomatoes. It was $5.50 for the bowl and $3 for the large mug of breakfast tea I got on the side. The tea was strong and served in a big mug, though I wish the server asked if I wanted room for cream as it was filled almost completely to the brim. This seems primarily a place for UChicago students and faculty to study and socialize, light music played in the background, but the place never got loud. I will definitely be coming back, but I can see how it's easy to spend quite a bit of money quickly here, everything looks very good!They also do to-go food and drinks and I thought it was cool that they have a coat rack at the entrance for backpacks and coats. Smart idea when winter hits the Windy City!","This place has gone so far downhill I can hardly believe it. Was once my go-to in the area for a mocha, and occasionally a breakfast croissant or a grilled cheese. Between the worsening staff, the constant array of bugs and occasional mice, and the food now struggling to meet mediocre quality, there's no longer much reason to come here at all. The staff used to be friendly and fun! Their reward card is a joke as well-- I got large drinks every time I came here. Fill up the reward card and you get a small (ridiculously small) drink. I asked if I could pay the difference and get my large-- 70 cents more than the small. The reply SHOULD have been no problem, you're a regular customer, we'll cover that 70 cents. Instead it was ""reward card upgrades cost a dollar."" I pointed out that the price difference was less than that, and the rude girl just repeated herself. If you all don't give a shit about your customers-- let alone the ones that are here 4-5 times a week-- then screw this place."
8,"Cozy cafe with friendly service.  Dropped in for a quick bite on a weekday and tried the Rodin sandwich (Chicken, bacon, avocado and more) served with chips...will be back!  Crowd at noon on a Monday was small, a handful of people talking, working, or in my case enjoying my food while people watching our the window.  A steady stream continued to come through for coffee.","What I like about it:- Quiet atmosphere but not so quiet that if you are talking with a group of friends, you will be uncomfortable. Just be sure you're not talking super loudly and disturbing people.- Natural light (sometimes can get too bright)- OK coffee (nothing to write home about, but not bad at all)What I dislike about it:- The pastries look good, but are not actually very good. The croissant we got was not flaky but rather kind of hard and brittle. It looked like it was a little old.",Bad customer services good coffee. Really like the decor. Bread is pretty good. Cold brew coffee is my go to,"My boyfriend and I come here just about every weekend for the Chai latte. For those used to drinking chai from places that use concentrate, like Starbucks, you'll notice this chai tastes much fresher and original. It doesn't have quite as much spice as chai usually does, but you can always add extra spice. I enjoy the freshness and unique taste this chai offers, I would definitely recommend trying it if you are looking for a real chai latte.","Volumes has a great atmosphere and because of it, it's an awesome place to sit and read (hence ""book cafe""). Nonetheless, it's a good choice to have some quiet time for a few hours.And now, the coffee. It's relatively cheap for an upscale-ish place. The serve metropolis coffee if that means anything to you. Their special beverages and pastries are quality too. I enjoyed a chai latte. It was (how you say) aesthetically pleasing and tasted great. They also have a wide selection of books to choose from. I, myself am not much of a reader so I can't say much about the selection. However, I would come back for some of their open mics and other events!","Not your typical starbucks, this place is one of a kind.I love all their 80's movie theme decors/menu, it really made the place more hip. Cute spot to chill.","They were open on a Sunday when another preferred deli was closed, so I decided to try something new. Chicago yelpers lead me astray. It was not worth the 4.5 star rating.The bourbon vanilla chai latte was just plain chai tea with milk! No notes of bourbon or vanilla came through.The pumpkin pie latte was weak and they didn't even mix it properly, as all the seasoning sat on the bottom.The Fisherman's sandwich had a generous amount of salmon. The only problem was the everything bagel. Where did all the seasoning go? See pic. Otherwise, it was an enjoyable sandwich.Overall, it satisfied my craving for a lox sandwich, but I would not return.","Cute little cafe. The Jamaican coffee was delicious, so was their Great Gatsby sandwich. The sandwich seemed a little pricey, but the size was decent and it was great. We had an issue where one of the drinks in our order was also ordered by multiple people behind us - and somehow the employee  kept giving my drink to the them even after they gave us our food...? Some sort of miscommunication there, but other than that it was a pleasant visit and worth the stop :)","I love cupitol drinks, but their pastries are really not worth your dime. Their brunch items are pretty okay but compared to some of the brunch places around it, this one is just okay. My favorite drink on their menu is the mint white hot chocolate. The place is cozy, with some high communal tables, regular tables, couches, and booths. It reads more coffee shop than restaurant to me at least. Beware coffee lovers - on the weekends, they limit the number of tables that people can work at so that the brunchers can find seating. Either come early or come on a weekday.","I like the two Dollop locations in Streeterville and Gold Coast. This location was very disappointing - coffee was bitter, service was super slow, seating was minimal and uncomfortable. One of our drinks was handed over to us while leaking from the bottom and the barista could not be bothered to change the cup.","Love this place! So much natural light, big and spacious, interesting artwork, and amazing coffee/tea and pastry/sandwich selection. Glad to have discovered this coffee shop in my neighborhood. They have free WiFi and plenty of study space so plan on spending a few hours here :)",We came here because we had time to burn before Halal Guys opened for lunch a couple blocks away and I'm glad we picked up coffee at intelligentsia. My vanilla latte was perfect--no complaints. Baristas here know their stuff! The interior is also really cool--a lot of people chilling here with laptops or reading books. Only downside is that it's expensive! But...it is truly well-executed coffee..,"truly a unique little coffee shop. the food looked excellent, but the coffee was amazing. I believe they use back of the yards coffee and my cappuccino was wonderful. They have an attached reading room that can be rented out for private events which is really cool. The people who worked at the shop were incredibly nice and this place caters to a lot of tastes and seems like a neighborhood staple. I came thanks to a recommendation from a friend and am glad to have followed through. The shop itself is quite big, lots of cool lil places to sit and enjoy. They have $1 coffee on the go and on the menu it said bottomless coffee for $3 so the prices are just right too. Enjoy!","I would not recommend any espresso drinks from this location. I just ordered an iced mocha, the barista forgot about the shot (which was pulled into a milk pitcher???) while helping another customer, and then overpulled the second shot too. She filled the cup half with almond milk, filled the rest of the milk pitcher (containing the shot and the syrup) with almond milk, and then poured only half of the espresso/chocolate/milk mixture into my drink. So I received maybe a quarter-strength drink that I paid $6 for. I get that people are learning, but this poor girl was alone on shift and looked genuinely terrified by making this drink. There really should be a second employee on to train for the sake of both employee and the customer.Its really a shame that I've had such poor service at this location (repeatedly) because I love the downtown Dollop spots. Unfortunately will not be returning for espresso any time soon.",The latte was almost as good as the service! The ladies were very friendly and helpful. The caramel latte I got was very flavorful and was perfectly crafted. I will be stopping here regularly. So refreshing to have a coffee shop in the area!,"Nice place for Saturday brunch near the Museum of Science and Industry and U Chicago. Choose either from the walk up bakery or the sit down restaurant next door. Brunch options that we tried included the smoked salmon omelet, breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros. Service was great . Walked to the bakery next door and it looked great as well.","So many memories coming back to Hyde Park.  I graduated from The University of Chicago in 2010, and since graduation, I've been living in Texas.  For the holidays this year, I came back to Chicago. I decided to go to the Plein Air Cafe & Eatery with my best friend and visit the college.I love the atmosphere here.  There's a lot of natural lighting.  Love the wooden tables.  The place is small and intimate, and it has a lot of character and charm.   The best part was seeing people with philosophy books.  My friend had drip coffee, and I had the cafe au lait with extra coconut milk.  The coffee was, however, a little too strong for me.   Plein Air is still a great cafe.","I've been going to Robust for 6 years now.  It continually has gotten worse and worse.  The mochas are more foam than liquid now like a cappuccino.  I understand it happening once or twice, but it's been several times now. I'm not paying $5 for foam.  A sandwich, chip, and pop are always over $10 and the wait to get the sandwich is often near 10 minutes. This is acceptable if the food is unique or good, but the food is rather mediocre and not worth the price. Starbucks is about a mile North on Woodlawn, I might have to start travelling there for my caffeine kick."
9,"Rad little neighborhood coffee shop with a decent collection of artists and thinkers that frequent it. My favorite drink is the Rothko; the Claudel is pretty spicy so be warned if that's not your style. I've been known to frequent this spot for the coffee, the conversations and the local art/music events.","I tend to hold cafe's to a higher standard, I'm from Brooklyn (of the New York variety) and I would be arrogant enough, yet justified in saying, we have the best coffee shops in the world. I believe the success of a cafe can be attributed to a few rudimentary but greatly overlooked qualities - it's just coffee, not magic. I meannn what is the hiring process at THIS coffee shop? There must be stipulations in order to be employed as a hipster barista here, you must 1. Be apathetic to anything and everything, 2. Be so soft spoken and quiet that people could only hear you by summoning demons from the Necronomicon and ask them WTF you just said, 3. Detest any and every MALE that walks into the café who isn't, Anton LaVey, H.P. Lovecraft, or Barbra Streisand, and 4. Practice witchcraft daily. What is it that we all love about coffee shops? It's really simple actually, strong but delicious coffee, good music, a warm and welcoming atmosphere with interesting and/or attractive people. The ""coffee"" could vaguely be called as such because it tasted more like someone who just drank real coffee peed into a cup, which mind you was only equally as warm but not nearly as flavorful. And although the awkward mortuary like atmosphere in this shop encourages absolute funeral-like-silence and stillness, you are made to stand up, walk over to the counter (with the judgmental barista overlooking their work like Rasputin above the Gulag) pick up the urine-like-substance, and as if you are a monkey on a circus tightrope, carefully walk back to your micro sized table meticulously carrying an overly full cup of said pee-coffee, clanking and spilling all the way back. All this whilst, of course, everyone stares at you in disgust and disdain, a problem perhaps easily solved if the music wasn't going on and off as if the Witch baristas were in a collective seance communicating with dead customers who had previously drank their pee-coffee, but instead only managed to channel terrible MGMT songs through a sound system that someone donated to goodwill in 1997. I have certainly been gaslighted, I left questioning my own sanity, like Macbeth being called by the coven of WITCHES, as well as feeling like I was severely molested (and ironically I happen to be catholic).","There is no better coffee in the world than Intelligentsia. I'm sure that Kopi Luwak is great, but I don't wanna pay $100 to eat monkey poop. The absolute best is Flecha Roja, which is normally in season around may thru December. This coffe is so delicious, it has a sweet finish that requires no sugar or cream to bastardize perfection.The Barisatas are all helpful when you want to try new bean selections, and they make the perfect espresso.The location is steps from the Division St Blue Line, and they also have parking. The inside is a beautiful combination of glass, cement, and wood interiors. More importantly, they have free wifi, and plenty of seating to lounge around.","Overall this was one of the nicer cages I've been to around Chicago. This is one of their few locations in the city featuring their mini bitesized doughnuts in several flavors.I decided to try their seasonal basil mint mocha drink and I was very surprised by how well everything mixed together and tasted. The latte art was prime and looked very well crafted. Overall one of my hands down favorite cafes I've been to around Chicago. The actual scene was quiet more in the early afternoon, but got more louder as more people came in. Seating was pretty rough and got pretty crowded. There wasn't too many spots to sit to get work done but the wifi had pretty good speeds. The cafe got pretty loud and somewhat distracting but this was a Saturday afternoon/evening.","This is easy. Volumes is a one of a kind experience in this city, and I don't just mean because of the book/Cafe hybrid. It's because of their insistence on being a part of this community, and making sure that anyone who walks through the door feels like they belong there.The book selection isn't vast like a Barnes & Noble, but it is very intentional and specific. If the is a book you want, they will gladly order it for you. I will say, I love their poetry section, add the kids section is pretty dope too.The coffee drinks are mad inventive, always tasty, and often book themed. The Molly Weasley is a personal favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of the Bronte sisters. Oh! And they have boozy coffee drinks and alcoholic codes and beer if you want something stronger.They often have readings, performances, and workshops, and the team here makes it a point to find ways to give back to their community and Chicagoans in general. Plus, Rebecca, the owner, is just a cool person.I highly recommend.",Hi um the coffee here is great :) Actually just had probably? the best latte of my life last night from here (honey bear). I love the vibe of this place. I'm a huge nerd and really appreciate all the star wars and pops I saw throughout the shop. Such a cool little gem in Chicago.,Best bagel sandwich In Chicago! Consistent and friendly staff. Would recommend to anyone!! The must try is the  Bageler sandwich,"Love this cute little place, very cozy and relaxing atmosphere, can get a little noisy with all the DePaul students eating there.  The food is fresh and the menu is interesting.  Perfect place to grab a lunch with a book.","My review is based on horrible service not the actual food/coffee...sadly!I have never been to a place where the staff is shoo-ing you out because they are closing in 30 mins.Saying something like ""please note we are closing in 30 minutes but we hope you enjoy your coffee"" would be appreciated but instead we gotWaving arms in the air pointing to the door telling us to get out.Rude!",This is the second time I went and again they got my order wrong. When I told this the lady at the coffee machine she was even more upset with me complaining than I was with the messed up order. I'll take the longer walk and go back to. intelligentsia,"I go to Dollop all the time just to see these two lovely girls that work there. One is blonde, always smiling and has the freaking best tattoo sleeves. I could talk to her for hours. The other is super stylish and rocks a flannel every time I see her and she's super sweet. They are so nice to me and make the BEST honey cinnamon latte that I honestly recommend this place for the amazing coffee and the spectacular employees. You'll love them just as much as the coffee!",Very good coffee but the barista take his job very seriously leading to long waits for your drink,"I don't get to come here that often but its a treat for two reasons.  I always run into friends from the community.  Its a great comunity spot for meetings and such.  The food is always good.  I had a taco dinner.  what!??  IKR But it was perfect with two well flavored chicken tacos. no soggy shells they were cooked perfectly with a side of red beans, white rice and collards.  MMmmm MMmmm, so good.  Each completed the other for a perfect bite each time. I also tried the ginger tumeric chai, very yummy.   My friend had the chicken sandwich with a side of collards.  Everything is delicious which is why folks keep coming back.  Not so hidden gem near the DuSable Museum and the hospital.  Great choice outside of Hyde Park usual suspects.","Really love the space. Was not as impressed with the latte, it didn't taste like coffee at all.","This is the spot for me whenever I'm in the neighborhood. I had the baked oatmeal with fresh berries and almond milk and it was perfect, along with a latte. Prices are so so extremely reasonable, and the bakery case has yummy items ranging from 90 cents to three bucks. I love the aesthetic here. They have beautiful art pieces and a rustic, hip feel to the general decor. The coffee is roasted and packaged on-site and also sold at the Englewood Whole Foods. Everything is top notch quality with choices of $1 mugs of coffee if you order it to stay. I love the nods to Englewood throughout the cafe, from the outline of the neighborhood sketched on tables, to the coffee sleeves and paper bags. Kusanya also hosts neighborhood events, a fresh foods night market on certain evenings, yoga on weekends, and open mic storytelling. Kusanya is also a non-profit that started on Kickstarter and that stays afloat through community support and grants. If you want to donate check them out online or stop by and ask about it. I look forward to trying their sandwiches! So so good!","Came here for lunch on a Saturday and were seated immediately. I ordered a Cajun chicken pita sandwich, which was decent. I asked for potato salad as my side though and was given fries instead. The waitress quickly corrected the error and brought potato salad.Overall, not much to say about this place. The food was average and the service was good. Not really 5 star-worthy but nothing bad about the place either","I had a really pleasant visit here. In a city that suffers bitter cold much of the year I can't imagine a better oasis than this outdoor eating section. I had the root veggie quiche. I'm not a vegetarian but it was seriously so satisfying. Protein from the eggs, carbs from the potatoes,  and a green salad on the side. I also had an espresso which was good too.","Interesting!!! This is a college district, so I would image things would be cheaper - I guess not. Came here with a friend, just so happens the same sandwich caught both our eyes - the Brisket Grilled Cheese...yum!  Although it was very tasty, I don't think I'd come back. The price of $9.37 for a grilled cheese with a few shredded pieces of beef with no fries/chips or a drink...that's SUPER expensive. My friend's total came to $15.37, she ordered a small coffee which btw is $5.50.  It's another $1.75 to upgrade it wasn't worth it.  Also, I would image this venue is relatively new, the space is nice and it seats a great number of people, but the seats are horrible. They're all taped up and sunken in. I'm not sitting on that, gross!!"
10,"I really liked the folks working here.  They were pleasant and made my first trip a nice experience.  Not to bash the great vibe, but my sandwich--The Klimt--was not very filling.  It was ok but underwhelming, both in portion and just the general taste.  It was also a tad pricey, as were a lot of their sandwiches.  The glass plates resembling artist palettes were cute, but the rest of the place felt more student lounge and less quaint cafe.  That's not a bad thing, just an observation.","Coffee shops in Logan Square are a dime a dozen, much like bars around here. However, because of it's easy to find location, Gaslight stands out which gave me enough of a reason to stop by and take a load off. Very great tasting coffee here, at an affordable price. A lot of seating too, although it's always fairly crowded here, so good luck finding a seat! This is not the best cafe to do any work, as it can get a little loud up in here.","$9 for a 12 oz drip and a pastry.  I could get a full diner breakfast, omelet,  hash browns, toast and a bottomless coffee for $10. And don't cast me off as someone who just doesn't get coffee culture. I get it.",This place has great chai latte made with whole milk of course. Also has a friendly vibe from the staff that is very welcoming. The ambience is also nicely laid out with plenty of tables to do work and strong wi-fi.,"Love this coffee shop/book store/Knick knack shop! WiFi is great and there's plenty of large tables and outlets if you need to get some work done. Plenty of unique and interesting curios for gifts. And best of all BOOKS, real physical pages of ink and paper!! There's an adorable back corner for children to read and relax. Looks like they have lots of neat events all the time (yoga, book signings, education, etc). Their drinks are reasonably priced, caffeinated and alcoholic, and the muffins are scrumptious, will definitely be making this a regular spot!","This place brought me back to my childhood with Nintendo's, movie posters of awesome 80s movies and just a funky vibe! It's the only coffee shop I've ever been to where you can just be you and you won't be judged by anyone! The staff are very friendly and kind and that's the main ingredient to a great coffee shop! It should be like you real home, not your second home.Their coffee is...well, let's just say you won't be disappointed! Brought to you from halfwit coffee roasters, so you know it's good stuff, but it's just made with a lot of nerdy coffee love and I guess that's what makes this place such a cozy hangout spot for the all time fans of the 80s or for those who just wanna go somewhere cool and just being themselves. I had a special latte called A shot in the dark (not sure if it's a reference to the movie) but it was might good!",These bagels are incredible! There is a printer station as well in case you need to print.,"Service 3, Atmosphere 5, so average of 4.LOVE the vibe of the place, came on a rainy Sunday afternoon and the cozy environment inside was exactly what we were after. The music playing was nice background music and there was a great eclectic vibe to the cafe.We did make sure to stay in the main room, as while there were more tables in the room next door, it was library level quiet and we were there for catchups so that silence wasn't going to work for us. Luckily we could snag one of the few tables in the main room. Supposedly there is usually tables upstairs but it wasn't open when we were there.Now service could left something to be desired. We all wanted tea, my friend wanted an English Breakfast. I couldn't see this option in the shelves of tea so I took my tea up to the counter and asked if they had English Breakfast, given that's a pretty typical tea. When I asked the woman said they did, but couldn't find it. So I asked if she could recommend which type from those available  would be closest to English Breakfast (there were Irish breakfast, Scottish Breakfast and a couple others). Her response was ""I'm not a tea person"" and couldn't provide any recommendations and her demeanor was just that I was putting her out. I'm not usually one to expect too much knowledge from staff about everything on the menu, but when the sign out front says tea emporium I would assume some tea knowledge from staff. So I just grabbed Scottish Breakfast and hoped it would be ok for my friend.We then waited and waited for 3 teas to be provided (we also got a cookie and brownie but those were handed over immediately). It was surprising that they were using the espresso machine to heat up the tea hot water one cup at a time instead instead of having a kettle or boiling water tap.When we finally got our teas they were fine (provided in paper cups) and the cookie and brownie were great and we had a nice time catching up without feeling rushed.","I came here on a weekend to study with a friend, but the vibe can be kinda weird at first. I arrived at around noon and it seemed more like a cafe with a ton of people actually eating lunch than a coffee shop for studying. But after a couple hours, all the lunch people left and the rest of the people there were just studying. It was kind of hard to get near an outlet and half the seats are really uncomfortable to sit in (think hard wood chairs). Overall, not the best coffee shop to study at but also not a bad coffee shop to study at. My latte was really good and the food that people ordered looked and smelled really delicious! Will definitely be back even if I'm not studying there.","My first visit was last week. There was a problem with my order. Rather than post a negative review on Yelp, I contacted them. To my surprise, they responded immediately. And they made it right. A sign of a place that cares about its customers. I will return. Thanks Dollop. Much appreciated.","Good simple restaurant like starbuck, were students work while sipping coffee.Food is good even if choice is limited.Not expensive excelent coffee, good and quick service.Bon resto simple un peu comme starbuck ou les étudiants travaillent en sirotant un café !La nourriture est bonne même si le choix est limité. Pas trop cher, bon service et le café est excellent !","This matcha latte was $8 (& some change) :( yes I get it, it was probably good quality matcha and they encouraged me to try it with oat milk but I just cannot justify $8 for a SMALL portion of matcha. I would prefer an extra large steaming hot cup that I can sip on for an extended period of time, not this shooter glass. Also because of this price I was discouraged to get a pastry and to be completely honest I walked straight into Dunkin' next door after this and got my usual wake up wrap and iced coffee because I felt so unfulfilled. Got a good insta story tho!","The space is gorgeous, the coffee is perfect, and the staff is knowledgeable and welcoming. Whenever I have a meeting in Hyde Park, I always visit Currency Exchange Cafe. This morning I brought my whole sales team and we each loved our breakfast! I had the cornmeal breaded catfish with collard greens and red beans because I need to be gluten-free. My colleagues had fluffy scrambled eggs, big stacks of pancakes, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding topped with real whipped cream. This is an outstanding restaurant!","Great coffee and one of my favorite campus places. It's also a great place to do work or sit and talk. I also recommend the jammy hammy sandwich. Food and drinks are a little on the pricey side but it's better than pret and the other places on campus (except maybe the Grounds of Being or Plein Air, but those places are often more crowded).Also the music is usually on point.","Non-profit cafe, c'mon y'all, this is pretty cool.Folks told me, yeah, don't go to the South side. I'm from Oakland, and that's what people said about there too. It's kinda surreal here. This business should be supported!French toast is good, cafe au lait a bit burned, soup great, and the Cornel West sandwich pretty boss!The barista said they have music here sometimes.","I want to like this place - working nearby it would be lovely to have great food here.  It's just uninspired, boring and without much life.  The vibe is great, I love in interior, staff is attentive and friendly.  Maybe I am too much of a food snob - I'll admit that I am fairly harsh because I don't like going out to eat food that I could do a better job making at home, which is exactly how this felt.  On two occasions I ate here and neither meal was something I felt good paying for (tuna overcooked and dry, Italian sandwich was ok at best). I'm sorry guys I know there is plenty of love from the students at UChicago and it seems like you are an institution, just was not for me.","Love this place! I frequent Plein Air quite often for lunch as it is one of my favorite places in all of Hyde Park. This cafe is quite aesthetically pleasing. In the warmer seasons, it's lovely to sit outside right next to Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House and eat at one of Plein Aire's rustic tables. The service is always quick and attentive and the self-serve sparking water is a huge plus.My favorite items are the steak bowl, sweet pepper baguette, and hazelnut beignet. The steak bowl reminds me a lot of a Filipino menudo dish, which I absolutely love. While the sweet pepper baguette is my favorite, the baguette itself is always pretty hard. The beignet is very good, but may be too sweet for some. Be warned: Lunch rush is real and you may be standing around waiting for a spot for a while.","Best coffee house bar in South Side Chicago. Very nice friendly baristas. Their caramel frappe is the best! Its way better than Starbucks & Dunkin' Donuts! I love the atmosphere. It's very chilling in there. I live in Highland Indiana, and I be taking the CTA Stony Island Bus getting off at 63rd and take 10 minute walk to 63rd & Woodlawn. My buddy recommended me this coffee shop. The area is little rough, but this coffee shop is a must stop. I'll be coming back once in the while. Keep up the good work right here. I will continue to supporting this place!"
11,"Power Monkey Smoothie, The Klimt sandwich, art and the staff = a perfect day And watch the coffee beans roast right in front of your eyes. GC rocks my world!",This place has very great service!It's at a very convenient location and the tea is awesome.,"I love their space. But I am just not into the fact that I have to pay above $5 for coffee. Once I got a cold matcha and I nearly paid $8 with tips. In term of the drinks, I had better ones elsewhere.",Some of the best coffee Chi-town has to offer.  This particular location is right next to a great little park and Bloomingdale Trail.  Very convenient for a relaxing morning!,"I came through for Wicker Park Fest and this place has arrived since I last visited the hood.  I wish I lived right by here because this is an awesome reading/studying space with a hydrid bookstore/caffeine infusion station.  It's not quite a traditional bookstore: the selections are more curated/limited but they have a lot of interesting contemporary selections (most that you don't see in other bookstores), not as many classics.    A good mix of new and used, plenty of things to browse.","What a cool coffee shop! I love, love, love the decor! Takes me back to my childhood.  Want to take a picture with Keanu Reeves...head on over. Also love that there is a couch seating area in the back with old video games.  Totally creates a great ambience. What a gem in Wicker Park! Close to blue line on Milwaukee it is also quite convenient to get to.Coffee and service is great as well.  Will surely be back.  Seems to be pretty crowded but surely it's for a good reason.","Mmmm yum. My hangover was craving so substance before my day could begin. I found this place open early on a Saturday morning and in my neighborhood and of course top rated reviews. I did not purchase any coffee and was torn between the bageler sandwich or lox sandwich. Once I decided on the bageler (eggs cheese bacon chipotle mayo), I was ten torn between bagel (of your choice all made in house) or a croissant! I went with bagels, more filling. I waited quite a while, maybe 15 minutes. I arrived there about 8ish and while sitting waiting then eating the line was almost out the door and I'm sure those people waiting much longer for their orders. It was delicious I would definitely go back! Cute spot kind of hidden I rode right past it ok my bike initially.",My first time here today. Came here with a friend is a big fan! Fell in love with the old world charm. There is a adjoining are for only tea and coffee also. Everything is really old wood and bricks with black and white photographs of Chicago. I had a east of Eden sandwich. It was good but slightly expensive at $14 . Will be back next time for coffee.,"Such a soothing environment and very spacious! Ordered the Nutella latte and mocha latte but unfortunately, we were not indicated which latte was which and when a taste test was done, it could not be indicated as to which latte was which. It really wasn't that big of a deal so we continued to drink our coffee, enjoying the weather of Chicago and playing tic-tac-toe. Also ordered some sort of strawberry cake and it was quite tasty.","Perfect. A cute and mostly comfortable coffee shop. I had a maple latte that was perfect in every way: taste, texture and temperature. It was just pretty. The standard coffee however was a bit bitter and crazy hot. I would likely return to give those bagels a try and I've heard great things about the chai latte!","Best coffee shop in the city. Great ambiance and character. There wasn't a line when we got there, but for the 45 min or so we were there the line was to the door. I got the cinnamon hunny latte which was fantastic. The everything bagel w/ cream cheese and avocado is to die for. Great service, do yourself a favor, next time your in the city check this place out you won't be disappointed.","Got the cold brew. It was good, but not great.I am nitpicky with my cold brew. For me, it needs to be smooth without much acidity while having nutty caramel notes.The acidity of the cold brew left an unsatisfying aftertaste in my mouth.  The coffee just needed some more milk before I could enjoy it. If cold brew require's milk to ease the acid, then cold brew is not the best IMO.","I wanted to try ""Currency Exchange Cafe"" every time I passed through this part of south side.  For some reason I thought this place was at least a block west from the CTA Garfield Green Line station.  Oh no, CEC is literally across the road, though the signage could have been more conspicuous.  The building appeared to be antiquated, but it was the contrast between the ""past"" and ""present"" made the space remarkable.  I saw parts of the walls were purposefully left ""untouched.""  However, the coffee bar, the kitchen, and the restroom were clearly the new add-on or were renovated before opening for business. CEC serves coffee, tea, mixed drinks, and food fresh from the kitchen.  Orders are taken at the register, and items will be brought to the table.  I know this spot may be just a coffee shop for some; it's a solid light lunch spot for me.  Both catfish po'boy ($8.5) and the shrimp & grits ($12, as of 02/19/2017) were delicious!  Although there was minor clumping of the grits on the bottom of the bowl, after a few stirs that didn't really bother me.  They brew Metropolis Coffee.  Hubby and I really had a blast this afternoon.  The only complaint was the portion size of each entree; a bit more generous servings would have been desirable for the prices we paid.  Otherwise, a side of salad or chips would have been greatly appreciated.  Looking for somewhere to take five in the south side?  If I happen to be in Washington Park or near the west end of the UofC campus, I certainly will stop in.",I use to really enjoy them when they opened but my past few experiences have been horrible. There is only one barista who actually knows how to make the drinks correctly (a black man with blonde hair) everyone else does a horrible job of it. I allows get the Mexican mocha and it taste so watered down whenever other people make it. I don't think I'll be visiting this place anymore.,"I love this place. I come in once or twice a day. The quality of their coffee is beyond expectations. The other guys have nothing on them. The ambiance and decor are wonderful. Cozy and inviting with a very friendly staff. This is not a ""fast food"" place. Don't expect speedy service. Expect great service. Go Kusanya!","For sentimental reasons its definitely 4 stars and for its pastries. . . . but the food is just mediocre. This spot used to be a couple blocks down the road and was relocated to a much bigger venue. My Dad came here with my Mom while he was studying in college and living in Chicago back in the 70's. I think he also took some of his students here when he was later a teacher. So it was a favorite spot. Still charming as he had told us about it. For brunch I would definitely go the pastries or sweeter route instead of ordering eggs. The eggs benedict my Dad ordered he said was just fine and well cooked. My smoked salmon omelette was pretty lack-luster. Not a lot of cream cheese inside and raw onions and tomatoes. The eggs were kind of stiff and just didn't hold any fluff or flavor. The salmon wasn't too fresh and appealing. Though, it did come with a potato hash on the side. Kind of like scalloped potatoes that were super crispy. Those were fantastic. Also, the hard bagel I took to go and provided much happiness way later in the night. My brother's chocolate chip pancakes looked like heaven. We did however order a cinnamon roll to split and that was bomb. SO GOOD. Still warm and gooey. It was everything. Before we left we went next door to the take-out section for pastries and sandwiches and we ordered a bunch of stuff for a party. The fruit tarts, mini apple and pecan pies were a huge hit and tasted great. Definitely stick to ordering all of their pastries. Additional tip, I believe they are byob. It's advertised on the door even though I noticed brunch cocktails on the menu. Maybe that's for lunch and dinner. They also have an outdoor upper terrace where my sister said she hung out once and had pizza and brought in her own wine to share with whoever the hell she was hanging out with (I'm going to assume some relative). Thanks Medici for staying open so many years though and I'm glad I got to experience something my parents were regulars at over 40 years ago.","Cute cafe in Hyde Park. Street parking but it's tight. It has an indoor and outdoor area. Trendy ambiance. Mostly students from University of Chicago. Ordered some omelette, and it had fresh tomatoes and veggies! It was really yummy. Cold brew is unsweetened but sugar and creamer are available.","Not the friendliest baristas or the best tasting coffee. I guess they get points for the solid pastries and sandwiches. I actively look to support small local businesses and I want Robust Coffee to succeed. Their long-term success will coincide with a stronger focus on customer service. They have a really cool space, they just need to hire staff to better represent the business."
12,"This is such a cute spot! I stopped by with a rather large group to get some work done and the location and spot was perfect. Cute set up , great service, and awesome place to work. I had already eaten that day, but I went with the blueberry tea. Yummy! I'm not a fan of coffee so can't give you much insight into that, but everyone else seemed to be enjoying it. Next time I stop by I'll try out their sandwiches. The girl next to me had one and I was eyeing it. :)","Sophisticated, unique and expensive beans in simple prep (meaning no crazy syrups and lattes).  Plenty of seating that is easily filled with few turn around.  Humans warming the light grey steel seats with their laptops. (ToT) Some park their bikes inside.  Got lock?SERVICE is quick, attentive and fool proof.  Clean and organized VENUE.NOTE:  Rust inside washable tin WATER CUP is a design style.  My heart skipped a beat.  It's fully glazed/sealed and you don't feel the bottom rust at all.  A life (water) and death (rust) concept in a cup?","Loved the interior design, friendly and quick service. Some coffee beverages can be improved over others though.Ordered a 12oz Soy Latte and loved it! The foam on top was light and fluffy. The Soy Milk shined through the espresso flavors wonderfully. The Latte was smooth and just warmed me up perfectly! I enjoyed my Soy Latte until the very last drop! The Cold Brew we also ordered was just alright. It wasn't as strong as the others we have had at all. Even before the ice melted, the cold brew was already very diluted and just didn't pack the punch like other cold brews. The flavors weren't very robust, but it was refreshing! This cold brew was more easy to drink in comparison to others, so if that's what you're looking for, an iced coffee, then this is for you.","Wow! This place is a must go. My friend took me here after an amazing reflexology session and I was already in a good mood but this place's latte made my day even better. I decided to go with the Nutella latte, because who can resist that? My friend had the ipsento latte and we got two mini donuts that were the donut versions of our drinks. The Nutella latte was nothing short of amazing; it was sweet and tasted just like Nutella and gave me the perfect afternoon pick me up kick. I tried the ipsento latte and it too was delicious. It is made with cayenne and coconut and the combination creates a smooth and slightly spicy and slightly sweet taste. The mini donuts were also sooo good. I just wish they were bigger! The atmosphere of this place is clean and modern and they also serve beer and other alcoholic beverages. Many people were studying while we were there. The cashier who took care of us was friendly and helpful and not pretentious at all, which was great, since this seemed like it might be the place for pretentious people. The only small complaint I have is that in  the restroom that I used the hand dryer wasn't working. Other than that, I was in love with this place!",Really love this spot! There is a great selection of current titles + some autographed copies! I snagged Electric Arches by Eve L. Ewing and was stoked. They also have coffee. (I didn't have any so I can't comment on it at all.) The owner was super nice. I plan on swinging by again next time I'm in Chicago.,Cozy old school coffeehouse. The vanilla bean and peanut butter koopa troopa were both excellent. Decandent and good enough for both satisfying my coffee and dessert urge. Only wish they had more pastries available though.,"This place as always a go to when we lived in the area.  Today we stopped in to get 2 items to go;  a bagel and a bagel sandwich.  The first bagel was with cream cheese.  They didn't even toast/steam the bagel but rather just threw it on a cold bagel.  For the Bageler Sandwich they didn't toast/steam the bagel either but just threw the fixings on it.  So it was a mix of a room temp bagel with warm toppings.  Not sure if they changed their approach on their bagels before serving them but they didn't ask us either if we needed them toasted/steamed before either making the sandwich. Disappointed in what used to be a very solid, go-to spot.   As mentioned above these were to-go so we didn't realize it until we opened them when we got in the car.","Utterly ridiculous.  How can a place that serves lunch close at 12:30 on a Friday? Coworkers and I ordered lunch. A sizable order and we were informed that our order was cancelled because they ""wanted to close early"". Huh?  Sorry, no way. Why would we (or you) attempt to try this place when you don't know whether you will get your order or not?Find some place else.","Good place to eat, not great but good. The water glasses are like shot glasses so you have to keep running up to get water. I wouldn't tip as there is no wait staff. They give you a good amount of food for the price and it is prepared somewhat well. I got the ham and it was very dry. I would come again",Coffee was fine but they don't recycle anything! So much trash that doesn't need to be thrown away. Come on guys it's 2018 just get two cans.,"Good location, just a few blocks off of Michigan.  Friendly staff and a very open feel.  Music cast a funky vibe to the atmosphere.Coffee was delicious and they offer multiple sandwiches and danishes if you are looking to eat.I will be back for more.","Consistently great coffee at all Intelligentsia Coffee cafe!Rich, intense, aromatic and smooth flat white. Just the right balance of milk and coffee. Their barristers never failed to make my day with their coffees! Beautiful in execution, balance and presentation.","This was my first go around at the currency Exchange Cafe so I tried sampling multiple items from the menu just to get a taste of as much food as possible. Well unfortunately that didn't happen. Of the relatively small menu, two items weren't available, of which one truly disappointed me. The restaurant couldn't make pancakes..... pancakes!!! I had a yearning for pancakes and they didn't have them during breakfast hours. Realizing I already had two strikes and a third would've meant I giving up and just going somewhere else, I decided just to get a traditional breakfast. Grits, egg, turkey sausage and their signature biscuit with a hot tea as my drink. Everything thing I had was just alright. The setting was dope and the service setup was very unique for the restaurant's layout. It has the feel of a trendy restaurant that looks to turn into a neighborhood favorite casual meeting place. The patrons were very diverse in makeup, which is good because diversity makes everyone feel welcomed. All in all, I don't know if I'd try the cafe again for breakfast. The lunch menu has better reviews than the breakfast menu anyway.  Plus I'd hate to come back and leave with an unfulfilled taste for pancakes!!!","Wonderful addition to UChicago's north campus and a welcome gem to Hyde Park's already crowded cafe scene. But students can never have enough cafe options. Because I woke mere steps away from this establishment I've grabbed coffee from here many times. Their coffee is smooth and strong. I've also highly enjoyed their almond croissant which was flaky, buttery and creamy. I'm currently sipping on a lovely chocolate milk. This airy cafe with high windows allows for light to pour in and makes for a pleasant experience whether one is working, relaxing or just popped in for some hot cocoa. I'm happy to be a regular!","I was on a film shoot with my crew on the south side of Chicago and we needed lunch and to setup shop for a little while to capture footage. We found Kusanya Café and it was great.Staff was friendly, had some wifi for us to use, and the food was great. Pro tip: get the Chicken Funkadelic. Really delicious chicken salad, not smothered in mayo, with a little kick.Wish there was one closer to me, I'd go frequently.","Wow, this place is still goin' strong after all these years, just like me (on a good day).I hung out at the Medici when I was a very young hippie chick.  We were either in Old Town or Hyde Park, cuz that's where hippies went.  To be with other hippies.  Cuz nobody else liked us.  But we really liked each other. Like we had a choice.  Peace & Love meant you liked everybody.  Trippy.The Medici reminded me of the Sink in Boulder, CO, with all the carvings on tabletops & names/drawings on the walls.  We hippies were a creative bunch & we liked to leave our markings wherever we went.  Kinda like dogs, but we had more hair.At the Medici we drank coffee while having meaningful, heated conversations about political stuff.  Oops...maybe nothing has changed.I didn't much like coffee then, but I drank it to be cool & to appear older.  I do remember eating Medici food but not a lot.  Hippies were skinny, didn't eat much due to no bread (money). No wonder our threads (clothes) were baggy.In CO I recall we foraged for berries & edible green crap, and I remember eating macrobiotic birthday cake in Boulder that tasted like sawdust.Gifts for that cat's b-day consisted of fresh-picked field flowers or poems, because....no bread to buy anything.But back to Chicago:  Way back when, I thought of the Medici as mainly a coffee house, not really a restaurant. There were no chain coffee shops back then - this is what a coffee shop was, often connected to a bookstore. Hippies rapped (talked) a lot, read books & didn't eat.....wait....the current Starbucks scene comes to mind.....far out, manI groove on small, independent businesses that stick around for 60+ years.  Hangin' loose at the Medici.  Righteous.  Outta sight.  Can ya dig it?Gotta split now.Later","Beautiful, bright atmosphere, peaceful crowd, good food! I am a regular for the play-it-safe tuna sandwich with fresh spring greens, soup du jour and latte. What can I say? I am just very comfortable coming here, sitting in or outdoors, and connecting to the wifi (high speed).",I love their half off breakfast deal from 6-8. Robust bowl with sausage is my favorite. They also have many options for lunch items and I've recently had one of their newest salads (chopped bellview salad). Delicious!!!! I do have to say I enjoy coming here after 9ish since it can be really busy for the half off breakfast deal and a little noisy because of the school kids.
13,Wonderful service along with great coffee how can you beat that!  And I really love that they serve the wonderful nearby Kitty cat cafe!,"Wow! What a lovey coffee joint in the middle of Logan Square. I saw this place from the Blue Line as I as riding from the airport during a delay and had to stop in for a coffee. The store is located on a great corner street with huge front windows overlooking a great street view. Not only that, the interior is chic and modern with a hipster twist. Their menu is professional and thorough and their baristas are skilled. I enjoyed a great pour over while I relaxed and passed some time. Stop in and enjoy this place!",I can't believe I just paid $4.50 for a middle-of-the road ice coffee . This place would do well to charge more reasonable prices.,Best latte I've ever had. Treat yourself with their Nutella almond milk latte. There's space to work or meet with a friend. They have cocktails too if you want a first date spot. Right underneath the 606 so you can walk after.,"Great spot. Super convenient on public transit by both buses and trains. The place seems to be divided into two. One area for the food and another for the books. Great drink selection, I went there on a cold rainy day and the warm latte really hit the spot. As for the seating, there are a few tables set up in the cafe area, if you choose to read and eat and also a few in the store itself if you only wish to read. There was a good selection of outlets too so this is 100% a spot you can come work at. As for the books themselves, there is an excellent selection. You can choose from children's books to bestsellers. They also have puzzles and little toys to choose from. I really like that they have some pencils already laid out for writing. They also have 3 book clubs that meet usually on the second Thursday of the month. You can just drop by whenever you want! The three are: Book of the Month, Sci-fi/Fantasy book of the Month and Feminist book of the Month. I would suggest reading these books even if you can't make the event. (They have very good choices each month)My highlight however was that this place has $3 blind books and the money all goes to a charity. However you can only buy these with cash.","My SO fell in love with Wormhole's coffee. I tried their Honey Bear latte and I have to admit that it is one of the best tasting coffees that I had I  Chicago. Drinks:Honey bear latte: a slightly hint of honey and latte. Very nice and good under a rainy day. Koopa troopa: peanut butter mousse mixed in as a latte. My SO likes it but definitely not my fave. I like my peanut butter in solid form. Ambience: Very very cool ambience. A very 80s feels with a back to the future car in the back. Furbies, POP figurines and cat paintings on the wall. Definitely a sight to see. Coffee bean: Bought several types of coffee beans here. They ate roasted by HALF WIT roaster and we gotta say it's pretty good (espresso wise). A local chicago roaster and we will be ordering more online!Ps. They can do a little more work on their latte art. Lol :)",One of my favorite local places for coffee and bagels. Very nice staff and great atmosphere to hang with friends or catch up on work. Highly recommend the Farmer's bagel sandwich.,Love The Pig for quiet coffee meet up or a quick soup or chili.  It's cozy and the servers look like they would be my friends.  Wish they had iced tea though.,"I was in town to go to a Blackhawks game and visit friends.... They wanted to go to a ""coffee place"" for breakfast.... Why? I thought to my self. I actually want food for breakfast... Well to make a long story short. Bang! We arrived and got our food. THE FOOD WAS AWESOME!!! I can honestly say, I have never had as good of food at a coffee place in my life. This place is a must!","Stopped in and had a small latte. Very well executed. The only drawback is that it's served in a paper cup. I know it's part of the American culture but will never be able to get used to that. Ambiance is relaxed, nice view of Chase plaza from high stools, however,  not comfortable. Stools are made for a kindergarten, not even half of my buttocks fit on it and I'm not considered a big person. Maybe that's the strategy of the place, in and out.","Overview: amazing food and drinks, great prices, good atmosphere.Our group got a variety of drinks from hot tea to iced coffee and they were all extremely delicious.  The make your own bagel is great with several different bagels, including garlic, herb, plain and more, spreads, goat and regular cream cheese, and toppings like avocado, tomatoes and cheese to choose from. The herb bagel is delicious and their portions are awesome. I got a garlic bagel with cream cheese, regular cheese and onion. It was really good!  They also sell lunch sandwiches all day and it comes with a pickle and a very small but yummy side of potato salad. They made our food and drinks pretty quickly and were able to wrap them up to go. The atmosphere was very comfortable and had a typical coffee shop feel.","Great place to get a coffee and snacks. I was super curious about the name. I had a butter croissant, Havana cold brew and chai mata latte. I loved taking a little break from exploring the city. The coffee was good and was much needed. Stop by if you see one :)","I love the atmosphere. I was here working since I work from home. My friend and I decided to order food. The menu sounds and looks amazing. But I wasn't pleased with the food. My standards are high since I am from Louisiana. I order the Fish and Grits. It came with fried catfish, greens, a biscuit and of course grits.The catfish was so bland. No seasoning in the batter at all. Was so disappointed. The biscuit came out and it looked amazing but tasted like cardboard. I tried to use Jelly and the jam was too watery. Now the greens were amazing. If you are working at times the music can be a little too loud. I don't think they know their identity yet. Is it a coffee shop where ppl can work or a coffee shop/restaurant. I will give this place another chance and hopefully they amp up the seasoning on the food.",Visiting from Cincinnati we asked for recommendations for a coffee house.  Dollop was recommended as a good place.  Pros: -Very bright interior with large windows.-A few couches to sit in for relaxing with others while drinking coffee.Cons: - Music is distracting and not relaxing and kept going in and out.- Pricy.  Two iced coffees and one pastry was $13. - Decor feels more like a cafeteria than a coffee shop.  Wide open space with white bare walls with the occasional painted coffee related art on the walls.-Outlets are literally falling off the wall leaving wiring exposed.,Great little gem of a coffee shop. Incredible coffee and great food to boot. Surprisingly great prices and very helpful staff. Definitely will be back!,"My fiancee and I love the food here, and hired Medici to cater our wedding. Without any explanation, less than two months before our wedding, they stopped responding to our emails and phone calls. Now we're scrambling to find another caterer on very short notice. Don't rely on Medici to cater your special event-- you'll only end up wasting tons of time and adding unnecessary stress. This was a shameful way to treat a loyal customer.","Favorite place in Hyde Park. Definitely a spot I wish there were more like. Every food item I've had has been superb! Bonus: They sell Metric Coffee here which is my favorite! Get the Hazelnut Beignets! Service is great, space is wonderful but surrounding area is currently under construction. Overall: a must try.","I don't come to Robust often, mostly because it's a bit out of the way from everything else around the Hyde Park/Woodlawn area. BUUUT, when I do come, I am never disappointed. I'm not a coffee drinker (although I hear their coffee is incredible), but I do like hot chocolate. And their white hot chocolate is the absolute best. During the winter, I am willing to walk a mile and a half in 15 degree weather down from my apartment just to satisfy my Robust craving. In the summers, I get their lemonades which are also great.The apple fritters--divine. The donuts--delicious.This place is a hidden gem, and it's great for the flourishing community in the Woodlawn area. There is always street parking and is a 15 min walk away from the UChicago campus."
14,"This place is a great location for studying! Also, they seem to have some amazing artwork hanging around that adds to the relaxing environment. The owner Geno is super friendly, and he is super passionate about his coffee selection!","Awesome decor, awesome seating, awesome latte. I really loved hanging at this coffee shop, but I will say my overall impression was on their quality roast. I loved how smooth their coffee/latte's were! I was super impressed with the whole experience and the neighborhood. Also, found free parking! SCORE. The music was a little loud as others have stated.","You really can't call Intelligentsia pretentious just because the baristas have dark rimmed glasses and beards.  Or because the coffee is $4.00+ per cup.  Or because the seating area has a minimalist, void feeling.  You just can't.The baristas are nice and properly described the seasonal mocha to us, which was made with a little bit of malt powder.  They also answered my friend's 1,000 questions about where they buy their white coffee cups, and what could she order to get her drink in one?The seasonal mocha was outstanding.  Coffee here is made with TLC.  The chairs in the seating area are deceptively comfortable.  The pistachio croissant was okay, a few dollars too expensive, but damn I was hungry.I felt a proper caffeine buzz several hours later.","It is the best latte I've ever had. The roast on the coffee is full bodied, smoky and mellow. Good dairy, chunky ice cubes and a jar.Peaceful, groovy vibe inside the join",Legit giving this place 5 stars because of the matcha latte itself. There are so many cafes in Wicker Park I feel like Volumes is somewhat underrated. Volumes is 80% bookstore and 20% cafe. The cafe is just a little counter with a small selection of drinks but their matcha latte is the best matcha latte I have ever had. It's definitely more creamy and sweet but that's why I love it so much! The space is super cute as well. You can grab a book and sit there and read. There's even a children's nook just dedicated to younger consumers. They also have a lot of non-mainstream books supporting local authors or poets as well as unique greeting cards. I will always come here for their matcha latte!,"I'm not a coffee drinker, but I would go to any length to get my paws on a peanut butter latte: the KOOPER TROOPER. WH is a trendy, hipster modern day wormhole that transports you to the 80s/90s, and everything old that people love to resurface. Like, an antique Macintosh. I do not belong in any of these sentences, yet I was still welcomed with the smiles and aroma of some quality coffee. Hop on over, even if you aren't a coffee drinker!Spacious enough for personal space or group parties! NOSTALGIA, anyone??","Great coffee and bagels. These aren't New York level bagels per se, but they're the closest I've encountered yet in Chicago. Kettle-boiled, homemade, and served warm, they pair nicely with their homemade spreads. I got iced coffee (just right and the price is right, too) and an everything bagel with chive-garlic spread. Yum! Nothing here is overpriced, and they have WiFi and art for sale on the walls. What a nice spot to hang out, study, or catch up with a friend! I'll be back to try some of their other bagels.","Ever since I've moved to lincoln park this cafe has been amazing,Breakfast-yummyCoffee-deliciousLunch- great gatsby is amazingThe price relates to the portion. Some sandwixhes10$, some 6$, and it is because you get 2 huge sandwiches together such as great gatsby.Its so convienient & I love the vibe. Its a perfect place.","Looking for a boutique cafe with trendy coffee shop vibes ? Check out Cupitol in Streeterville near Navy Pier. It has a very European feel to it. Life is slower here. The food for a cafe is above average if not almost elite. Good mix of healthy, unhealthy, light, and hardy options. The vibe is outstanding. The service and cooking is slow - you have to know going into it is going to take 20 minutes for your food - so don't come in a rush. They do take out so if you call a head it can be ready to go. We like grabbing brunch or lunch here. Few of our favorites: basil gnocchi, little potatoes, burgers (trust me they are good!), or even a traditional breakfast burrito.","Poor service.  Ordered a pour over coffee today along w/ a 12oz bag of Kenya single origin.  I was told that I would get a free coffee with a purchase of a bag of beans.  I ended up getting charged the full amount for the pour over coffee.  I at least expected a credit for a small drip coffee.  The ""barista"" also did not know how to pour a cup of pour over coffee.  She probably poured 100 grams of water and then let it sit for over a minute.. helped customers.. poured another ~100 grams... let it sit for 2+ minutes.... and then came back and finished it off.  I feel that Dollop is not really a place for specialty coffee...","I've been twice and ordered the breakfast sandwich both times. The BREAD is a piece of heaven. I wanted to order another one after I finished, but I have this conflicting goal of being in shape. I shall return again when my daily calorie allowance lets me! Great matcha too!","I was visiting Chicago for work and decided to try this place out on Saturday morning. I heard they have a Geisha coffee, which is rare to find, so I walked the two miles from my hotel to try it out, only for the barista to tell his manager that he doesn't feel like making it.  There was no explanation as to why he didn't want to do it, and there wasn't a line, as I know that pour overs can be a time consuming process. They fumbled to make an alternative suggestion, but I simply left in frustration.  Plus one star for the unsuccessful attempt.","This is an amazing little place right off the CTA. All the staff are amazing, they have cool old rap/R&B playing, and a vintage vibe. More importantly, they are a ""green"" restaurant with composting, and support community organizations. The food is classic Southern with a twist, and it is delicious! The lunch soul bowl I got was a soupy mix of southern goodness. I loved the bits of sausage I got in there. The shrimp and grits was a little soupy for me. Four stars because the menu did not seem super diverse to me, though it looked great, and portions were a little small. I would go back for an afternoon coffee break and a bite of comfort food. Great spot!","Much better place to work than Starbucks down the street. Usually pretty crowded with students, so be prepared to share a bench. Tip: sit farther from the doors if you can -- they let in a nasty draft in the winter and there are 3 sets of them!","Rosa J. believes that every community deserves a inclusive, inviting, and ""empowering"" spot to hang out.  Kusanya Cafe is an Englewood represent, located on the southeast corner of Green and 69th. St.  I do have to admit the surroundings are a bit sketchy, even though I don't anticipate immediate danger during the daytime.  The cozy joint is absolutely nice to get coffee and light lunch fare at reasonable prices.  I saw many regulars take advantage of the free wifi and bright sunlight to get work done.  I had the ""Ham Master Jay"" sandwich made-to-order by the friendly young lady at the register.  It was executed impeccably and tasted delicious.  Together the large, 20oz. latte and the sandwich cost less than $10 after tax.  After visiting various coffee shops in the city, Kusanya is one of the most inexpensive places I know.  If you happen to be the area or need to grab a quick bite nearby, Kusanya is an excellent choice.  The nearest El station is the CTA 63rd./Halsted Green Line.  For CTA buses, #8 (Halsted) and #67 (67th./69th./71st.) are in close proximity.","Went with friends for dinner and had Garbage, pan pizza for the 2nd time; it was very good warm--thick but good bread and lots of ingredients. The pepperoni was different & crispy good! They now have drinks! Got a pretty good Paloma that was a bit bitter from the grapefruit, but I balanced it out with lime and salt on the (b)rim. Chill place for family or friends with great service--thoughtful but not too overbearing.","Cute place to study, but I had so many issues here that I had to leave. First, the girl who took my order was quite rude and had a terrible attitude. Second, there aren't too many plugs so I had to wait around until one opened up. Third, the wifi would not work and so I had to get up and move to another cafe/coffee shop to get my work done. And the worker who I had asked the wifi from was rude and quick with his response. Fourth, food and drinks are expensive and wasn't even the best of quality. Watery latte and an okay burrito. Not coming back here when I'm in Chicago.",Great coffee and the Food is even better.. Not the best area to hang around in but all in all it's worth it.Quick Tip: When ordering THE ELVIS be sure they don't water it down or skimp out on the peanut butter...
15,"I usually come here and the service is great but last time I came I ordered my usual and was waiting for about 17 minutes after that I asked the lady if they have started on my order and just answered ""Omg"" come to find out they forgot about my order had to get my money back and gave me a few free coffee coupons but i don't even drink coffee Came for a smoothie today and it's taste was a little off .","Cool coffee shop, interesting loft design, good looking latte.Friendly staff, cute pastry (though I didn't have any but they look delicious!) good ambient music. Great place to escape home to read a book.Thank you for supporting 2A","I had a mixed experience here today. I got a latte, which was VERY good. Zero complaints on that (except that the latte art wasn't as impressive as other Intelligentsia locations, but that's total nitpicking and has nothing to do with the great taste). We also were able to find seating right away in the middle of the day on a Saturday, which is something that's usually pretty difficult to do in Wicker Park. Additionally, we were in close enough distance to an outlet to plug in. Score! However, there were a few issues, the largest of which was that it was very cold inside. Today was warmer than it's been most of the winter so far (about 40 degrees), so I wonder if they thought they didn't need to have the heat on anymore due to it being relatively warmer. Whatever the case was, it was very drafty and uncomfortable. Maybe we had the worst of it being under some kind of vent with a fan, but we had to wear our coats inside for the few hours we spent here while working on our laptops. I noticed that the people sitting next to us also had their coats on. Also (and this isn't as big of a deal), but the space is sort of cramped and awkward particularly when power chords are involved. There were two women in there with strollers and I had to unplug my chord so they could get by. I'm not quite sure why the outlets aren't underneath the tables.  All in all, it was an A-OK experience. Assuming the cold temperature was just a one-time, irregular time, then I would totally come back. My latte was honestly fantastic, and being able to find a seat with ease something I really value. If the temperature is all good the next time I return, then I'll update my review.","I'm dropping two stars, yes two, because of Ipsento's ""no laptop rule"" after 7 p.m. I would respect the Ipsento team so much more if they allowed me to be in a social environment and work and drink wine on a Friday night - as sometimes one must do. It's very unusual to prohibit your customers from enjoying your space in a way that makes them comfortable! Sometimes, forced trendiness disappoints. That in mind - Ipsento has great coffee, there is no question. And if you are dropping in to grab a latte to go, you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a spot to sit down and read or do some work, there is sufficient seating considering the size of the shop, however it's not comfortable. Only one of the tables has chairs with back support - all other seating options are stools. Not a huge deal, but worth keeping in mind when weighing your coffee shop options.","This is really a place where you can take some time out of your afternoon and have a cup of coffee.  The staff works fast on making your coffee and they let you do your own thing.  Now, they have a pretty expansive book selection with categories that you wouldn't find at a lot of places.  I picked up the cocktail manifesto and having the cafe a few feet away to sit and read it at was great!  I only wish they offered a more expansive sweets section.  Great neighborhood spot.","Pretty cute spot with video game and movie references, lounge area seating, and tasty drinks. Most of my friends and I ordered the Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa lattes, while one ordered the Honey Bear and one ordered the Cool but Rude latte. I was hoping the Koopa Troopa would have more chocolate flavor (not too much of a PB fan) but it did not. Nonetheless I still liked it and it wasn't overpowering. I tasted the Cool but Rude and would have liked that better I think. I would probably come back to this place if I'm in the area to check out their next specials and have a pastry!","This is a super cute little bagel, coffee and tea place! I got the sea salt bagel with garlic and chive cream cheese along with a berry iced tea and it was all really good. They give a generous amount of cream cheese on the bagel as well, no skimping! I went around 4pm and it looks like they also put up a lunch menu too around 11am/noon or so. Super quirky and cute here. Would highly recommend!","Servers are slow, unresponsive, and generally cold and unkind. I live nearby so I want to like it, but every time I'm disappointed.","This is a fun & classy ""fancy coffee & lunch"" fast-food type place, & while the drinks & food look fancy & delicious, they seriously fall short on both quality and flavor.I was excited for my Nutella latte.. when I got it, it tasted watery with a hint of nutella. The chicken blt had watery guac.Plus side is that the people at the counter were extremely helpful & friendly.It has potential, but needs to step up on flavor.","Oh Dollop, why must you have less locations than Starbuck's? Especially since you're incomparable. I must have you more frequently, but I guess 5 days a week will be sufficient for now.But in all seriousness, Dollop is my favorite for a morning coffee run on my way to work or when I get a 15 minute break between working. In a weird way, I tried to find a reason to not like this place since I don't have one close enough to home (the addiction is real).The coffee is strong and the espresso is the most flavorful I have ever had. It is the only one that does not taste stale or burnt compared to the competitors. Also, this is the ONLY place I have ever ordered a latte from and it tasted more like espresso than it did milk. Heavenly! Which again, is why it is incomparable to any other coffee shop I have found in Chicago. I get withdrawals on Saturday and Sundays.",I highly recommend give Dollop a try. Awesome space and location. The fresh baked bagels are great! I like to drink Chai tea. I was a bit disappointed that they chai comes out of a box but it was still decent. The latte aspect was well done. I'll be back!,"I got the tea which tasted great but over all there weren't many options and it seemed a bit over priced. It's cute, but it's not much.","This. Spot. Is. AMAZING!While exploring the Washington Park area, we stumbled across this neighborhood gem. We absolutely loved the food, drink, and atmosphere so much that we've returned several times since.Why do we love this spot so much?First, the food is fresh, flavorful, and fantastic! House made biscuits and bread, hearty bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, the most delightfully flavorful house-made spicy fried chicken sandwich, delectable house-made jam, scrumptious Metropolis coffee beverages, and so much more!Second, the space has a fantastic atmosphere. Clean, open, and homey, we found ourselves able to come to Currency Exchange for a variety of reasons. Whether it be to tackle some work in the basement area with a plethora of wall plug-ins or to meet with a group of people and chat! All of your needs can be meet!Third, it is a professional and comfortable coffee/lunch restaurant that makes it clear that all people are welcome. Just as Chicago is a sanctuary city, this cafe is a sanctuary cafe for all the locals, Chicago explorers, and travelers that come through the doors.Thanks for being fabulous, Currency Exchange. We will see you soon for our next dining adventure! :)","Coffee is a little pricey at $2+ for a small. The place gets quite packed with students. If you're looking for a place to sit down and work, they have a lot of seating options if they are not all already preoccupied. It is mostly bench-style seating where several (assumed) strangers share one table and bench. There are also small tables and bar-style seating available, but in smaller numbers. Overall, if you're looking for a place to work, expect yourself to be kinda crammed in like a bunch of sardines. There is also a small area with sofas that are comfortable for small get-togethers if you wanted to chit-chat, but again, you have to be fortunate to get these seats if they are what you are looking for. The busy-ness gives the cafe a nice ambiance.",This place is beautiful. The food is good and the ambience is wonderful. Friendly staff. Nice place to read a book or get some work done.,"While I enjoyed the food and atmosphere of Medici I was put off by the price point. For my garbage burger aka a burger, cheddar, caramelized onions, bacon, and bbq sauce on a brioche bun with a side the cost was $17. What?! At 5 Guys I can pay $8 for the double patty with the same amount of meat and toppings. The side options are cole slaw, potato salad, chips, or French fries. The cole slaw I got on the side was quite good, the cabbage was crisp and the dressing was not too mayonnaise-y and not too sweet, a surprisingly great cole slaw. The brioche bun is from the bakery portion of the restaurant, airy and light though not super buttery.My friend and I ordered inside at the cafe and then sat outside to wait for our food. It was our first time here and we got somewhat confused by the cafe vs restaurant portion of the establishment. From my understanding, the cafe serves at least partially the same food as the restaurant, but all to-go. Our burgers were ready about ten minutes after ordering and the actual packaging of the to-go orders is quite effective, I wouldn't be concerned about carrying something from here to a class or form a twenty minute walk away. The outside eating area is quite nice, there are about eight tables of two and four tops surrounded by foliage.",My dad (an ostentatious Marooner if ever there was one) has been dragging me to this mediocre pit for years. I suppose he wants a bitter pour-over to match our mutual feeling and conversation. My advice: steer clear unless your bag is shabby-chic humanities graduate students preeningly leafing through drivel.,Love love love! Great coffee and atmosphere. Try the Breve iced with an extra espresso shot - my go to. Best part... parking is always available! The only con is it is a bit pricey but typical for a great coffee shop. The employees are super friendly too!
16,Great coffee roasts! We use Gallery as our roasters for our office and they provide great service and the coffee tastes great. Its nice to have a local coffee versus ordering from larger company.,"The ambience here is very modern and pretty. It's a really nice place to sit and enjoy yourself...if you can find a seat. Can be pretty hard to find a seat on the weekend. The baristas are always friendly, and the coffee is good. But I think my favorite aspect is the food menu. It's very unique, not what you normally see at coffee shops. I think the menu may change sometimes, but one time I was there we actually had a small charcuterie plate. Pretty cool for a coffee shop!","Visiting Intelligentsia has become a routine on my days off from work.  I discovered this location when I was looking at several properties in the West Town/Wicker Park neighborhoods.  If you often feel the ones in the loop area are too crowded and lack sufficient seating, this Intelligentsia has along-the-wall indoor and outdoor bench seating, a plenty of lighting through large windows, and friendly and gregarious baristas.  Their iced chai was done right, so was Daddy J.'s Americano.  This probably is my favorite Intelligentsia location, for its conveniently located within walking-distance from the CTA Division Blue Line station, #9 (Ashland), #56 (Milwaukee), and #70 (Division) buses.  Therefore, north-siders, west-siders, and south-siders are all certainly welcome.  Their decors and choices of furniture are simple, modern, and space-conscious.  Come, enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, and relax your mind!  Patronizing Intelligentsia is the most inexpensive retail therapy one can have in the city: all you need is $5.","What Ipsento is doing in the city of chicago is pretty awesome. They are bringing the coffee to the people literally and allowing people to be a part of their success by crowdfunding their hopeful expansion. This location is very close to their other one, but offers a much more modern feel. The other a lot more cozy and I'd say more conducive when you're trying to get work done. Each cup of coffee here can be made in the style that you prefer. Really nice that it's nearby the 606, I only wish I discovered it when the weather was warmer. Luckily, that seems to be around the corner. Very much recommend this place to coffee lovers, also check out their lil mini doughnuts.","One of my favorite places in wicker park. Curl up and read a book. Participate in the readnings from local authors, have a coffee or a red wine whichever you prefer. Volumes has a great collection of books, especially their scifi section(my fav). They also reward you for your loyalty with a points system that helps you to save a few bucks. LASTLY, you can sell back gently used books for book credit!!","Back to the future car, 80s music, old movie posters, first macintosh, floppy disks PLUS really yummy caffeine concoctions so what is there not to like?! Order Koopa Troopa or Vanilla Bean and hangout and you're are set!","While on a walk around the neighborhood on this lovely afternoon, I saw a line out the door for this bagel shop and decided to see what people were waiting for- I'm SO Glad I did! The shop was small and cozy, 6-7 tables at the most....the sounds and smells greeting me were music to my senses...The art work was interesting to look at, and I didn't mind the wait to place my order or pick it up. There were Large samples of chocolate chip bagels and cream cheese to try while waiting-a sweet taste of what was to come.My go-to on the weekend is always smoked salmon and the Fisherman was a Fantastic sandwich: I chose an everything bagel to accompany the salmon, pickled onions, capers, and tomatoes- crispy, chewy, savory! I couldn't decide between the giardinara or garlic chive cream cheese, so I bought them both :) LOVED them both :) and saved some for later.I also had the Bageler on a jalapeño bagel and it spiced up the fried egg, bacon, muenster cheese, and chipotle mayo perfectly!! It was a true breakfast sandwich (at 12 noon).Even though it was kinda warm out, I had a luscious hot chocolate with whole milk and it was frothy, rich, and velvety--Fab!The Bagelers Coffeehouse was An Excellent way to start my weekend, and I know what I'll be trying next: the sea-salt bagel with strawberry jam and peanut butter....mmmmm","I used to love this place but recently came and the chai latte was so bad. It tasted watery and had no flavor. I asked for another one, assuming a mistake had to have been made (in the past I loved all of the drinks and food here! A friend also took a sip and confirmed something seemed wrong) the second one was also horrible.I ended up leaving early to just get food somewhere else.","Pretty disappointing. I got the non fat chai latte from here and there was just a ton of cinnamon on top and zero chai flavor. Literally all i tasted was cinnamon.... I get a better non fat chai latte from star bucks, sad to say.I also got a cinnamon roll which I ate about half of. The frosting was a decent cream cheese frosting but the actual roll itself once there was no more frosting was dry and tasteless. The ambiance seemed ok in there... a lot of people working and chilling, definitely seems lok e a place I could come to and get work done... but not drink any of their stuff. Needless to say... I won't be back here.","I craved a chicken pot pie one week. I settled for frozen. Unhappy with this, I moved on with my life. I went into this Dollop for a coffee as it is down the street from my office. I spotted chicken pot pie on the menu. I was shocked. I was upset! I had settled for frozen crap to get my fix. Alas, I was not hungry on this day. So I returned on another and got my pot pie of chicken. The meat, so fresh! The crust, so buttery! I've gotten it twice. I force myself to eat the side salad because I'm still hungry after guzzling the pie. But the salad is good too. I recommend this item!!",The Honey Cinnamon Latte is fantastic. It had just the right amount of cinnamon. I also ordered a breakfast sandwich which was overpriced and wasn't anything extraordinary. The coffee prices here are very reasonable. They have lots of seating available but it was almost full by 8:30AM. This seems to be a great place to study or work remotely.,"If you are looking for good coffee but willing to pay a pretty penny for it, come here. The menu offers your staples and some more adventurous drinks. The only milk alternative available is oat milk, first I was scared but actually was pleasantly surprised. There's an assortment of treats and pastries that taste as good as they look. Overall this place feels as smart as the name makes it sound.","Visiting from Michigan and stopped in here, everything I ate was delicious, fantastic service, great music, and excellent space. I highly recommend anything with the collard greens. The soup bowl was heaven. Go there and then... you're welcome!",Awesome cafe! I ordered a coconut oolong tea and a snicker doodle cookie. Both were excellent. Barista was super nice.,I was grateful to learn of this place.  The entire setting is well thought out!  I was also grateful that the staff Janiece and Lisa were excited and seemed to be empowered.  They believe in the product.  This place was awesome.,"I stopped in on a Saturday and although it was really busy, I was seated immediately and was served. I had a sandwich and my friend ordered a milkshake, which she really raved about. I think I would try this place again, they appeared to have a really good menu and I would like to try one of their pizzas.",We purchased a large order of items to try out and one item was lost in translation. They did all they could to immediately fix the issue. Sometimes things happen and that's life. How a business responds communicates a lot to customers. We will keep coming back.Great drip coffee (I'm a coffee consultant and was super pleased). Great pastries. Great space. The campus is lucky to have them.,"Friendly staff and really good coffee. I had a tuna melt and I was very pleased with it. It was fresh and it came with candy. I didn't know it was going to have candy, so that was an neat surprise. I also like the location. I work in that area and usually get Dunkin Donuts by the train. I had extra time and was further down 63rd and found this place. Note: they made a mistake on one of my orders,  but were so nice and handled things well. Major props for that."
17,"The cafe looks and feels stale. The service isn't awful but is a little too snotty for comfort. The coffee is alright and the sandwiches, while they taste good, seem a bit light for what you're paying. I never feel comfortable hanging out here for any amount of time.It's not a horrible experience coming here but the vibe here is always kind of poor and I'd rather go down to Milwaukee Avenue and drink coffee at one of the places there.","Excellent coffee and environment, great taste and flavor.  One of our favorite stops when going back to Chicago.  No wonder the Chicago Tribune featured them in today's newspaper.  One of Chicago's finest, check it out!",Supposedly decent coffee but terrible rude service and inconsistent delivery. Would probably give even fewer stars were it not for their reputation.,One of the absolute cutest coffee shops I've been to in Chicago!We came at happy hour and both really enjoyed our drinks. I got one with beets and my friend got a twist on a mojito. I really liked the spices in mine and appreciated the subtle beet taste. The mojito was also great and so creative! We also tried the mini donuts. This is the only thing I didn't absolutely love. We got the Ipsento and the chocolate but they were both too spiced for me. However I definitely still look forward to coming back and trying more creative coffee drinks or cocktails!!,"Friendly staff, great coffee (Metropolis is the best), small bookstore, and open seating right off Milwaukee Ave in Wicker Park.","Fun 80's themed coffee shop in the heart of Wicker Park.  Where else can you grab coffee and see a DeLorean (like the one from Back to the Future)?  They also have old Nintendo games you can play to transport you back in time.  There are many tables and seating options throughout the shop and also outside. The drinks are pricey, but no pricier than a Starbucks. The $5 Cool but Rude ginger & curry sauce latte I tried was delicious. Both the ginger and curry flavors were subtle, but present. The honey bear has a fancy name, but it's a simple coffee drink that's delicious in a simple way.  There's paid street parking, but may be hard to come by.

These are delicious boiled bagels (NYC style), a variety of different and unique spreads to put on it. We ordered The Bageler Sandwich on an everything bagel (bacon, egg, and cheese). It was a little thin at first glance, but still really solid and on a great bagel.","Cute atmosphere, plenty of places to sit, huge selection of tea, and decent sandwiches. There's a big wall with shelves of jars of loose leaf tea. You just grab the jar of what you want and take it to the counter to order it. That was something I didn't quite understand on my first visit.","Sticky bun french toast was unreal.  Our group ordered blueberry lemon pancackes, mushroom spinach omelette, hashbrowns and a sausage gravy variation on eggs benedict.  Everyone loved their food.  Quick friendly service, as well.",This used to be one of my favorite places. The coffee is still pretty decent though a tad overpriced. But the real winner was he blueberry tea that they carried. Delicious just sweet enough blueberry tea. Dollop has wrongfully decided to switch to hibiscus tea. Now I normally like hibiscus but this tea was watered down and tasted like old gum that has been sitting in water for awhile. Do not get it. Bring back blueberry.,Was excited to try this small shop and buy a bag of beans. Very cool design and was busy. Unfortunately poorly made drinks served from a red headed Barista that took ride bariatas to a whole new level. Feel sorry for the owners of this shop that the team lets them down. Hope we just caught it on a bad day.,"I absolutely love their Limelight! It is a seasonal drink, but boy does it have a nice tangy kick to it! Never knew coffee and lemon could be a great combination. The cafe is small and inviting. Noticeably great for work/studying as it was quiet and had several tables. Will be back for my limelight when I'm in the area!","Hi,My husband and I visted Currency Exchange Cafe (approx two weeks ago I think) on a rare Saturday without our little ones.To be fair, I was unaware of the concept (not sure what you call it) of getting your own placeware, drinks, etc. Ummm, ok. So, moving on. I was totally put off by paying first for a casual dining place. This is not a fast food joint. In addition, there was actually a TIP option field on the self-order portals BEFORE you even get your food or have a chance to experience the service!  So, I already knew I wanted shrimp and grits as it was my understanding this was one of their specialties. The ""waiter"" had the nerve to tell me they do not serve shrimp and grits on the weekends. He said the rationale was to offer their client-base something ""different"" on the weekends since everyone orders this during the week. This literally makes no sense. Creole/southern/soul food is a big part of their menu. Like, why would you have fish and grits on the weekends (which my husband ordered) and not shrimp? I could tell dude was lying by the way he paused and stuttered. Why not just say....we ran out of shrimp?I ordered the bottomless cofee. Bottomless implies to me at least one refill right? Two maybe? In order to get a refill you have to be given coffee almost immediately. I was not. After several minutes of me waiting I ask about my coffee. I was brought cold coffee. I take it back to the bar and the same waiter offers to make a fresh pot. I ask him if I should wait at the bar with him. He says no, he ""will not forget about me this time"". I literally watch him from our table making cocktails and what have you for several minutes. I eventually go back to the bar and just tell him to cancel the ""bottomless"" coffee as I was already halfway through my meal. He offers to give me a cup to go (this is not bottomless is it). They were unable to cancel but brought me $3 single dollar bills to my table. And as I think about it, why the heck would you charge for refills?Music was good, but way too loud. Maybe I am old. An older couple had to go downstairs. It was the weekend of the Chosen Few House picnic.Hubby enjoyed his food. He said the greens were a little too sweet and the biscuit was more like cake, but still good. He would return. Not me!","I am so glad this place has come to Hyde Park! It's got great American-style pastries, and the biscuits are really indulgently delicious. The coffee and tea options are broad and consistently good. I think it's a great place to work, with the big open windows and ample seating and plug points. The service has always been friendly.","this cafe is probably my favorite in all of chicago. the interior is beautifully decorated, the music they play is perfect to bop to, and the staff is incredibly gracious and kind. not only does this coffee shop support a great cause, the coffee is smooth and fruity, and i really appreciate how they encourage their customers to use reusable mugs with lower prices. the cornell west was balanced with the sharp pickle and the rich swiss cheese, and the chicken gumbo soup was comfort in a bowl. overall, i'm a big fan and i will for sure be back to study, to chill, or honestly whenever cause its just that type of unforgettable joint!","I really enjoyed this restaurant.  It's a great breakfast and lunch joint near the university campus.  It's got a total college vibe but I also saw a lot of locals.The garbage pizza was excellent, their Sunday brunch eggs were fantastic.  The eggs weren't greasy, the bacon was good quality, even the potatoes had great flavor, I was impressed.  Service was friendly but it was a little hectic.  Our food did come quickly though.  A memorable breakfast/lunch spot.","This cafe is a beautiful spot to study, work or just chill.  Yes, it can feel a bit pricey, but the space and food/drink quality make it worth it for me.  I'm a big fan of their cranberry spelt scone, all of their lunch bowls (try the Balti bowl!) and the loose leaf tea options (blend 333 = soothing herbal tea with peppermint and chamomile).  The chicken that you can add to salads is a little too intensely marinated for my taste, but I am eager to try more of their sandwiches, pies and pastries.","This is my favorite coffee house.  The staff is always pleasant, patient and helpful. It's my go to for coffee, remote office, quick bites or just to see a smiling face."
18,"I absolutely love gallery cafe! Always have good coffee drinks, the donuts are amazing!!  They also have really good lunch menu items vegan muffins and good options for smoothies!  Always my go to cafe in wicker Park. If you're an artist of any sort come support local artists since they donate to aspiring artists!","Great beans, fast service, and a beautiful spot with lots of natural light and seating space! We picked up some beans to bring home with us - love the packaging with the wax seal!",Without a doubt this is my favorite coffee shop in Chicago. I love their iced oat milk lattes! The baristas are the best; they remember my order and exactly how I like each drink I order from there. The iced matcha with oat milk and honey is another great option if you don't want coffee!,Based on one visit:Good coffee but super slow service. It took nearly 10 minutes after ordering to get my cappuccino. Not worth it for me.,"Such a cute little bookstore in Wicker Park! It's really well organized, perfect for people like me who walk into bookstores and feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of literature in them. They have lots of options for drinks in their cafe section, they even have 3 tea lattes named after Harry Potter characters! I got myself the Ginny (an iced matcha goodness) and sat myself at one of the tables with one of the books I picked out. It's a great place to catch up with friends or rest up after digging through so much vintage.","If you are a sci fi movie fan from 1980/1990s, Wormhole is a must-stop!  Buy some Half Wit toast coffee while you are there. And did I mention....THE BEST LATTE I HAVE EVER HAD. Cool but rude latte with ginger and curry. Outstanding. Bottom line, they had me with Alien facesucker on the Millenium Falcon. You rock, Wormhole!","I woke up really craving a bagel and even though I've lived in Lincoln Park for a year, I wasn't sure where to go. I found this place and I'm so glad i made the 12 minute walk! I got a salted caramel coffee and an everything bagel with garlic chive cream cheese. It was all amazing. You can definitely tell the cream cheese is homemade. I took it home to eat because I was alone but I can't wait to bring my roommates back to dine in. The place is so cute. I will be back for sure!",3.5/5 for the coffee - only because I had to wait for my latte since the ordering system apparently  forgot about me (pretty homophobic if you ask me since it was pride month) but 5/5 for the eye candy barista.,"Everything is so good here.. -Visit #1: I loved the atmosphere, spacious room, multiple levels of seats, comfy chairs and couches, perfect for studying or chilling. Regular black coffee or lattes were not my favorite here. Pecan minitart was addictive especially with black tea. Staff are pleasant. Would come back. - Visit #2:So hard to find healthy options in Streeterville neighborhood if you dine out. So me asked the lady behind the iPad and she recommended the avocado wrap. Avocado wrap has scrambled eggs, Hass guacamole, queso fresco, pico de gallo and wheat tortilla.. Portion is very well-studied, Japanese style. I really liked this wrap a lot. Coming back..- Visit #3:I tried almost everything on the menu!! I tried all the tea selections. My favorites are the cinnamon Saigon and white tea. Served with with a bottle like a French press pot, their teas are so good!. Tried the tuna sandwich and it was so good!. Coming back..Fast forward 2 weeks of similar encounters. This place is just amazing!! They opened around spring of 2017. They're open 7 am- 9 pm. It can be very crowded on weekends. Original branch is in Evanston. The owner lived in Europe for like two decades so you can feel there is some European touch to the place. What I recommend here is everything. My favorites are the avocado wrap, European granola berries breakfast, Saigon cinnamon tea and falafel burger!! Don't forget the freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice. They do have amazing croissants.","I needed a break from traditional coffee places in the Loop (i.e Starbucks and Dunkin) and stopped in at Dollop to give it a try. The hazelnut latte immediately caught my eye and I gave it a try. It was delicious! The coffee can be a little pricey, however it was nice to try something new. The best part about Dollop is that it doesn't give off the chain vibe. Their baristas are super friendly and always seem to be striking up a conversation with the customers. The location is great and the layout is different. The shop faces the street, which allows the shop to be well lit, while providing customers a chance to people watch.","I believe this is a coffee shop chain in Chicago and you must go to one when visiting. They have a list of syrups for your latte - I got the Lavender Latte! Tons of room to sit, work or study! The latte was amazing - we sat on the couch and relaxed for a couple of minutes before we continued our adventure to Navy Pier. I want to try their food as the menu looked amazing - I'll be back!","I think Intellegentsia is the best coffee in the world. The spaces are always so cool and the baristas are beyond knowledgeable. This location is no different! The cool vibe inside matched the baristas. It may seem a little expensive but in my opinion its totally worth it. Once you try the vanilla latte, it'll be hard to go elsewhere....",I've recently started going into Currency Exchange fairly regularly. Great locally sourced coffee and a nice environment to get some work done or chat with a friend. Most of the coffee shops and cafes in the area are in Hyde Park and I find Currency Exchange to be a refreshing change of pace. I think it's a great addition to Washington Park and I love the whole Arts Block concept. If I had one complaint it would be that I wish they were open later! (they currently close at 4pm),"What a great addition to campus! Finally a good coffee spot with ample seating and lots of sun light for those of us still stuck in school studying! Coffee is great here as are the baked goods (made in house). The vibe is chill, good background white noise to study to. It's pretty quiet as well since everyone here is a student. You'll be seeing me here from now on when I need to get some sunlight and studying in!",My 1st time ever here! The neighborhood is rough. But the owner Phil welcomed me. I welcome it. In fact try the Chai and the Ham Master Jay sandwich. So good! I'll definitely be coming back!,Standard quality cafe in any college town. The garbage burger is a little bit messy and very soggy.,"The University of Chicago is beautiful-even it's local restaurants. This one in particular looks like the designers from Anthropologie designed it themselves. I only wish that the food tasted as good as it looked. I got a Turkey Sandwich, which is one of the most popular and a Dirty Chai. The turkey sandwich was dry, despite its contents. It tasted healthy, but I've had healthier sandwiches that tasted better. My mouth dried up so quick, I immediately got up for water. If you like chai from almost any other coffee shop in Chicago, from The Coffee and Tea Exchange to places like Panera and Starbucks- this isn't the chai for you. It flavor is so subtle it minus well not exist. It's not sweet, and if you add espresso the espresso is so bold it's overwhelming.","I was in town a couple of weeks ago staying in the area and heard this place was worth a try so we ordered for delivery. Got our food pretty quickly, The french toast was really good and definitely a good recommendation. Definitely recommend this place."
19,"I think I'm the only person that comes to this coffee shop for the smoothies, but they're legit! Made with 100% fruit, they're my personal favorite on the menu.I've had the coffee before and I think it's a little too bitter. Also, it's always extremely hot in here, not sure if the air is broken or what's going on. 3 stars for a decent ambiance with no frills but no complaints either.","I'm a bit of a coffee shop snob after having explored so many in Brooklyn while I was studying for my MCAT, and since moving back to Chicago, I've been searching for my favorite spots. Well let me tell you, this happens to be one of them. Not only does Gaslight roast their own coffee in house, but their small food menu and selection of pastries is quite enticing.I've gotten lattes, drip coffee, iced coffee, and iced tea here, and I haven't been disappointed. The only disappointment is the price, but that's pretty common for a small local shop. They do have free WiFi with outlets and it's a great spot to get some work done if you can snag one of the tables near the outlets ;) I also ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup the other day, and the tomato soup has a really pleasant spice to it and the grilled cheese came on a really delicious parmesan-encrusted bread with perfectly melty cheese on the inside. It's definitely pricey at $14 for a grilled cheese and tomato soup, but the portion is large, the depth of the soup bowl makes for easy dipping, and it was more gourmet than your standard can of Campbell's with white bread/american cheese grilled cheese.The service has always been good - fast and friendly. And you can tell this is definitely a neighborhood spot, with lots of regulars, and lots of employees high-fiving each other and the patrons that come in! Great experience overall.You can see pictures/stories on my Instagram @afoodiegoescleanish","A coffee shop in my neighborhood (Wicker Park) with a parking lot? Count me in! I started visiting this place based on the simple fact that they had a place for me to park and it has quickly a weekly visit for me.  The folks that run this location are attentive, friendly and always care to ask me how my day is going no matter how busy they are.  It's nice to see this level of personalism with a company like Intelligentsia that has really blown up exponentially over the years.  If you get here early enough to get a spot (seating is slightly limited), it's a nice space to to do work - their interior is really inviting and warm.  I love this spot.","Conveniently located at a 606 entrance, this coffee shop has plenty of stools available Sunday at midday, and the line was only 2 people deep! Prices are reasonable for a coffee bar, and they do serve food till 4pm, desserts, and alcohol! No laptops after 7pm, and the music is a bit loud to be listening to lectures, otherwise I will definitely come back when studying!Most importantly, their coffee selection is fantastic, and they do have pour overs till 3pm! Definitely check this place out! I loved my Ipsento latte, a perfect blend of sweet and spicy (it's just a touch of cayenne), well done!","I love spending time here. Not only do they have good coffee, seats, and wifi for getting serious work done, they also have a delightful collection of books, cards, and general souvenirs for readers. Having grown up buried beneath books at local bookstores (in a foreign country), this place feels strangely nostalgic and even a bit home.","Came here on a Sunday around 11AM to meet a friend from out of town and instantly loved this place as soon as I walked in! the ambience is super cool and they have a variety of unique coffees.  They have lounging chairs, couches, and table/chair options.  They also have a cool spot in the back where you can play video games!The service was super good and the workers were friendly as well.  I had the honey latte and it was super good- i would definitely recommend it / get it again. The orange blueberry scone was also very very good.  The flavor was rice and it was a nice size.  I spent about $10.50 for these two items.They also do offer milk subs such as almond/soy.Very cozy atmosphere with a hint of retro!There is street parking (free on Sundays).  It did take me about 10 minutes to actually find a space and still had to park 2 blocks down - but not terrible!  I would definitely recommend this place and cant wait to come back!  I wish it was closer to my house.","I accidentally stumbled upon this coffee shop, and I love it!There are so many different bagels and pastries and the coffee selection is up there as well! I cautiously ordered the salted caramel latte and it was amazing! I let my husband try it and he couldn't stop drinking it.Cozy little spot, has lots of seating.Instagram: @chefnatasha","Service -1Food -2I was so excited to check out this place. But I was incredibly underwhelmed.  I Ordered the breakfast bowl with no meat. Received it and the potatoes looked like they were the end of the barrel and had been sitting in the kitchen for an hour.Started eating the bowl and realized the best part was missing (avocado). Went to tell the bug-eyes staff member what was missing and he says ""oh we don't have anymore avocado""You don't think that's something I should know before paying? And I looked at him just like that. And he apologized and said he forgot to mention it and continued buzzing around the restaurant.I'll admit, they looked understaffed. But still, annoyed.  I ate two bites and decided not to make a big deal out of the poor excuse for a breakfast bowl.  I got a to go container and decided I'll take this home, buy avocado and use some of my own fresh potatoes to make this the way it should be.Just go to Mortar & Pestle for Sunday breakfast/brunch.","Great cafe with a variety of drinks and food. Great for studying, hanging out, or casual meal.I've only ever been here to study. There is a ton of seating, so I've never had trouble finding a seat. And the table-space is large enough that I can spread my papers and laptop out. One negative is fact that there are not many outlets, so I would recommend having your electronics charged if you plan on staying for a longer bout of studying. The wi-fi is free and easy to connect to. In my experience, it's also pretty fast.I have tried the Falafel Burger, Cheeseburger, Fries, and grapefruit juice. I think they're all delicious, decently priced. The burgers with fries make for a hearty meal, but I don't really have any leftovers. I like that they have a lot of juice options (though I think that their cold pressed green juices are overpriced), because if I'm not feeling a coffee, that is my go-to, and not many coffee-shops/cafes have them.If you just want some water, they have a side-table with taps for both still and sparkling.Overall, I really like this place, and look forward to trying more of their food, since I've liked so many of their other foods.",Coffee is disquietingly sour and watery. Quite too big for espresso and cup was super dirty.,Gr8 place to get some work done or meet up with your peeps! It does get crowded over the weekend but the coffee is bueno and the wifi is reliable. The sammies are quite good (esp the turkey sandwich). There are a number of Dollops around Chi town but this is my go to one!,"I was so impressed with this coffee joint. My friend and I came here while waiting to be seated for brunch close by, and I wanted a coffee. There was a fairly long line when we got in, and the store itself isn't too big so there's not much moving room. My usual order is a vanilla soy latte, but the cashier recommended me oat milk so I decided to try that instead. Their coffee is SO good. I could definitely tell the difference in quality and the vanilla added the right amount of sweetness. My friend got a hot tea which came in a mini pot and a bowl to pour it in. It was so cute!The only negative thing was that my coffee came out to $6 which is quite steep, but I didn't mind too much since I was on vacation. I don't know about spending that much on coffee on a regular basis though.",First time going here..Atomosphere is nice. Enjoyed my shrimp & grits & biscuits were SO GOOD! My food order was misplaced but was rectified quickly & I received complimentary drink of my choice.,"Not worth it. Super expensive iced coffee (maybe it was a cold brew) and it was way too strong and bitter, even after adding milk. I was really disappointed.","Kusanya is a hidden gem! The staff are welcoming, food is yummy & atmosphere is superb. We ordered the ""Bernie Mac & Cheese"" sandwich with an old fashion + chocolate donut. All of our food was rich in flavor and tasted fresh. There's a lending library & they host community events. This is a cool addition to the neighborhood, i'll be back for sure.","After 2 years of my best friend telling me that this was her favorite pizza spot, I finally tried it with her!  When you go in, there's upstairs and downstairs. We sat downstairs in the wooden booths, which were super cozy! We took a while to decide what to order since I wanted to look over everything, so I'm really grateful for how patient the servers were!We ordered the 57th Street salad and the personal sized garbage pizza. The salad include prosciutto, dried cranberries, romaine, with jalapeno orange dressing. We substituted the feta for mozzarella and took out the red onions. It sounds so simple, but it was so refreshing and made for a really nice appetizer. The dried cranberries and prosciutto made an excellent combination. I can't eat anything too spicy so I was a little nervous about the jalapeno being in the dressing, however it delivers just a slight kick that still made it enjoyable.  The garbage pizza comes with a whole bunch of meat. Had to have the peppers and onions removed since I can't have them, but it didn't lack in flavor. The different types of meat also brought different textures, which was pleasant. We couldn't even finish the pizza, guess we had had too much bread prior. (They give you bread and butter before you even order!)I hate being the person that is so picky asking for things to be taken out or for substitutions, but it's dietary so I gotta! Our server was really patient, reading over our order to make sure they got everything. They even made jokes with us about it, which made me feel a little less bad about making so many different requests. I thought my friend had overhyped this place, but I was really impressed and appreciated my time here. I can't wait to come back!!","Came here on my trip to Chicago in December and must say that this little cafe is the place to be if you want a good cup of joe! It's decorated minimally but tastefully. It seemed to be quite busy when I arrived there at about 11AM, so try to grab a seat as quickly as possible to ensure you have a spot to sit. I had ordered the Mascarpone Stuffed Brioche French Toast with a vanilla latte, and sweet Lord did those hit the spot after walking in the blistering cold, which I'm sure wasn't that cold but coming from Texas, anything less than 60 degrees is cold to us...Anyway, the french toast was sweet but not overly sweet, which was great because if it had been, RIP me as I had paired that with the latte. It was also filling, so I wasn't dying trying to find another place to snack at while doing touristy stuff. The latte was probably one of my favorite lattes I have had in a while as it was perfected with enough cream and sugar to keep my sugar tooth satisfied. Cute, quaint, and packed with delicious finds; y'all gotta check it out!","There are two rooms here: an airy one with lots of windows on the corner, and a cosier one where lots of men are playing chess. The regular coffee is pretty good, and comes in a very large mug. Apparently the breakfast sandwiches are also good. We got a grilled cheese without the bacon, and a bagel sandwich. Both were good (especially the grilled cheese), and we appreciated that the server confirmed that it was a grilled cheese without bacon when serving it. The mudslide was fun for being so decadent, but I didn't actually love it, though I can't say exactly why. Next time I might just get a donut."
20,The staff here are always such a pleasure and their smoothies are simple and delicious. Perfect for a quick and simple bite to eat as well. Also a great place to bring your laptop and chill while getting some work done or just hanging out.,"Wow!!! Let the discerning rejoice. This Chicago highlight has all the 3rd wave coffee goodness you crave with a total neighborhood feel. This is the perfect marriage of roasters and baristas who know what they are doing. Though I will say more, if you are trying to pick your one stop for coffee in Chi-town look no further.Let's start with the ambience. Right when you walk in you feel like you are right where you want to be. Cozy wood colors, lower light (but not dim), appropriate levels of music and the steady singing of steam wands and high end grinders. With about 6 or 7 individual tables, two bar areas and a shared community picnic style table, there is plenty of seating. And get this - FREE WIFI AND POWER OUTLETS. All the snobby goodness of the coffee with no one glaring at you for posting up for a work day (but do the right thing and keep buying coffee the longer you sit).The baristas were kind, engaging and helpful. Their recommendations were spot on (my Colombian Chimex was spot on!!!). The place was super clean, had two spotless bathrooms and a steady (but never overbearing) stream of customers. They offer a drip coffee, but if you have the time spring for the Chimex. The espresso drinks are also killer and expertly executes. Tea? Hot chocolate? Yes! They can accommodate you. Get here.","I was so excited to finally try Intelligentsia coffee after hearing about them for years.  I arrived early Sunday morning on Mother's Day and they were giving away a free flower to all women ... Either to recognize them as mothers or to give it to their mothers.  This is a thoughtful touch. The cafe itself is bright, open, and have a few tables and chairs to sit.  In general, great atmosphere and their service was friendly enough. The barista helped me choose the right coffee for me as i described my preferred type... Medium Bold with low acidity.  I got the coffee and walked out the door when I took my first sip.  It ... Was not good.  It was quite confusing.  It was heavily diluted while still having a strong vinegar note and a slight bitter note.  I gave it to my friend to try and seeing their reaction, I knew this wasn't my imagination.  I attempted to drink it again and couldn't.  I eventually opened the cup and noticed there was a decent amount of grinds and yet somehow the coffee was light in colour.  I'm sure this was a mistake ... I ended up throwing it away after the 2 sips.  We ended up going to gaslight roasters down the street.  They had a good coffee but their service wasn't good.Perhaps I'll give intelligentsia another chance next time but it's hard when you have Bowtruss and Caffe Umbria as its competitors.",Great coffee- chill vibe where you're not overwhelmed with picking what coffee/espresso to order- Friendly staff who really cares about their coffee craft. Enough tables to go around for you to grab you laptop and work while enjoying your coffee.Cute little donut treats for $1 each and couple of pastries as well. I tried their pumpkin patch latte (now available)- you can taste the pumpkin come through (no artificial flavors) and no need to add anything else. Sweet enough to perfectly balance the pumpkin and latte flavors come through. My boyfriend always orders the Western (ice coffee with some orange essence flavor) It's not a quick in and out like a Starbucks but you wait for good coffee- patience is key. It's worth the wait!,"Love this Bookcafe. It's got plenty of table space for you millennials to work at. And coffee and drinks at a reasonable price. I love love loved The Ginny, which was a Matcha Peppermint Latte that was $4. Never thought of matching up peppermint with matcha but it worked soooo well. It inspired me to buy my own peppermint tea bags to try to make it at home. They also have alcoholic lattes which I thought was unique.","Hi, my name is Casey and I'm a caffeine addict. It doesn't matter where I go, I make sure to get my fix in. Anyway, during my last trip to Chi-town, I came across this awesome coffee shop. The chai latte that I ordered was delicious and I'm a sucker for latte art so they get bonus points just for that. Definitely my favorite coffee shop in Chicago not just for the drinks but for the atmosphere. If you're looking for a chill, hipster, 80's/90's vibe, this is the place for you. They've got a DeLorean on display, Nintendo games on an old tubular tv and decor such as ET, Sesame Street and lunchboxes.If I didn't have to pay for parking, I probably could spend the whole day there. I would definitely find myself back to this place the next time I'm in Chicago.","Ate here on a recent trip to Chicago. My boyfriend and I were wandering the streets and stumbled in. We split an everything Bageler and it hit the spot! Paired with some delicious coffee, it kept  us fueled through a morning walk and trip to the zoo. The atmosphere is cozy and there were nice little flower arrangements on the tables. Next time I'm in the area, I will return!","Overpriced, regular customer service. Coffee doesn't taste as good as advertised. Won't come back.","I was visiting downtown Chicago last weekend and I stopped by Cupitol to have some coffee and charge my phone. I had the Nutella latte, and a cheese biscuit. It was good. The Nutella latte is not too chocolaty but it was good cup of coffee. The place itself is nice and clean. Unfortunately, they don't have a lot of areas to plug your phone. The service though was amazing. Everyone was so nice!!","Best thing to happen to 55 W Monroe in years - Dollop moving in! Staff is super friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Your implementation of Oat Milk is the bees knees in my Honey Cinnamon Latte. Love chatting with the baristas in the afternoon about nothing in particular - and using the Ritual app in the morning to get my drink and go. I don't even have to leave the building! :)","I love the vanilla latte here! Not sour at all and tastes so good! The cold brew was also good. The location was great, and it has outdoor seating which is good for summer! I love the design and decorations of the place, very neat and in fashion. Will definitely come back for more coffee!","Solid coffee shop with a cool vibe. Open space with room for studying or reading--it probably seats around 25 people. Outside seating is available. Overall good experience. The coffee itself was pretty good--they roast their own beans which is always a plus, considering they have control over their flavors. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I've had better coffee from other roasteries. With that being said, if you're just looking for a good cup of coffee, this will be a good experience.","I love the environment. Staff are very friendly. The food was ok, I had the blue plate special. The greens were sweet and I didn't expect that and personally don't like it. The catfish was fried beautifully but lacked seasoning, as well as the red beans and rice. The biscuit is to die for!!! I also loved the Pom Pom drink. I will come back to try mo e dishes.","Got an almond croissant here. It was BOMB. The almond cream had little almond skin flakes in it. I've never seen that before and it was great. The crust was beautifully crunchy and buttery. Excellent croissant, Dollop. I commend you. The space is surprisingly large and very brightly lit. Despite all the students, I felt that it was reasonably quiet.This feels strange to say because I generally like open, well lit spaces, but for a coffee shop, Dollop's huge windows felt a little strange. Perhaps I am too used to the softly lit, cozy atmosphere that most coffee places go for. Honestly, I need to go back here for coffee and update my review accordingly.",I love their coffee and sandwiches.  I work up an appetite when I roll dice with the guys on 71st and Halstead.,"Been here couple times. It's a small place with limited seating famous amongst the UC crowd out of a need for a café or just sentimental reasons. Lines are long during peak hours but you can find a place to sit otherwise. I have seen delicious looking pastries but the only thing I've tried here is their coffee and Mexican hot chocolate which was awesome. Menu looks good, willing to try their breakfast sometime. For the neighborhood, I personally love Hyde Park. It has its own charm and feels distant from Chicago in some aspects. You would have to spend some time looking for parking though since it's a busy stretch. Overall, cute.","Lovely spot for a bite, good cup of coffee and to hang out in a chill atmosphere. Large windows overlook a garden space with outdoor seating.  The garden borders the back of Frank Lloyd Weights Robie House. Tasty, simple, interesting menu. You order the food yourself then it is brought to you at your table. They don't bring the coffee, not sure what's up with that so you need to know to hover around the coffee pick up counter until the coffee with name pasted on it appears.Great spot and people working there.","Very nice place. I ordered the banana bread French Toast, very tasty. They have a nice size menu. Can't wait to return to try other things on the menu."
21,"I love local coffee shops and got to try this quaint spot. Definitely unique with the art work on the wall. Seating is mildly uncomfortable, I wouldn't sit here for more than 4 hours doing my work. Also, it was pretty cold, I didn't even sit by the door, but with people coming in and out, heat was hard to regulate. Their assortment of tea was a plus!! I couldn't even decide on which one to have (well, I am indecisive from the beginning) but still, lots of good tea to choose from","Good coffee shop studying location, lots of seating areas consisting of long communal bench, numerous small tables to share w/ one other person, and counter seats. Lots of outlets around the area to charge your laptop. WiFi is a tad slow. The place is a bit dimly lit but it has lots of natural lighting coming in. Thus, once the sun disappears, it can be a tad bit dark to study in, which may or may not work in your preference. Noise level is average.Coffee is good and decently priced. Workers are helpful and attentive. Very hipster place. Love their decors. Ample street parking that are metered/free.","Imagine this true scenario:Just landed at Midway airport. Awake since 3am ET. More hungry than thirsty, more tired than hungry, more impatient than tired. Final destination is 20-75 minutes in the opposite direction of this particular Intelligentsia which is currently 27 minutes away not counting the unpredictable traffic or crusty weather. After grabbing a rental vehicle, the obvious decision on where to go next is made....Which is this Intelligentsia, obviously. My fave Intelligentsia on Randolph doesn't have easy enough parking.Anyone that complains about matters inconsequential to the coffee lacks appreciation for the, at times, inconvenient reality of chasing expertly created espresso.","Omg please try the ipsento latte. I got mine iced . It's such a magical combination of flavors!! Espresso + honey + cayenne + combo of coconut and whole milk. I knew it would be good, but it exceeded expectations. Truthfully I can't say say the same for the ipsento mini donut, but it was good as well for only a dollar. I've been wanting to try this place since moving to wicker park as it's right off the 606 and it just looks SO COOL with the windows open. It's a great spot for relaxing, studying, etc. good spot overall!","Volumes has everything you want: an area for kids with many excellent picture books and a nice selection of YA lit, lots of great recommendations by staff, coffee, fun book nerd gear and a good mix of old and new literature.","*** Workspace ***It's a bit dimly litted and most of the seatings are for lounging. If you're the type to work sitting on table, your only options are a big communal table or a hanging bar table nailed to the wall. It's not my preferred work space (esp. Because it's always bustling) but I come again and again for the delish coffee and to relax surrounded by geeky retro memorabilias.*** Coffee ***Phenomal and one of my favorite go-to cafe. It was love at first sip. All their drinks have personality (in both name and flavor). Each drink is unique but in general all of them have a well-balanced spice notes.","Would highly recommend! The ambiance was good, cashier was friendly and patient, and the food was delicious. My friends and I all order the fisherman on everything bagels and regular spread. In retrospect, I should have ordered the garlic spread, so I'll have to do that next time. The salmon portion was quite generous and there was a heavenly layer of cream cheese. Not too many capers (a plus for me) and the tomatoes didn't make the sandwich feel soggy. The coffees were fine. Ordered a salted caramel mocha which was VERY sweet and a cafe au lait that was fine. Seems like a nice place to meet with friends casually or get some light reading done.","I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review.  I was a regular here back in the 2000s when I was a DePaul student.  I recently came back to meet a client and it's even cuter than I remember.  Staff is friendly, wifi is free and the ambiance both in and outside is just great.  Highly recommended.","I love this place. They have lots of coffee, smoothie, juice and food options. They also have lots of seating and overall is bright and well lit, which makes it a good place to do work / study. The music can be a bit loud at times if you're trying to get work done, however, if they stick to instrumental music it's not bad. Overall, recommend this as a coffee shop to do work.","I visited on a Tuesday afternoon.  The place was hopping with downtown employees and folks on their computers.  I ordered a cortado, one of my favorite drinks, and really enjoyed it.  The service was fast.  While I waited for my drink I struck up a conversation with who turned out to be the manager of this location as he straightened up items in the store.  Super nice and friendly guy :) This location has the equipment, coffee, and friendly and trained staff to make any visit a good visit.","Ok place to grab some coffee and get some work done. Not my preferred coffee shop to study at, but I live right across the street, so very convenient for me. There are a couple large tables, seating about 10 people at max each. There are two bar seating areas against the windows. A few couches and armchairs. And then a couple tables for two people. On the weekends it can be pretty crowded, so it might be difficult to get a big group in here. Usually, if I'm studying by myself, I can find a place to sit. many of the chairs are wobbly and not the most comfortable. Some of the tables are tall enough to be standing-desk-height, which is great for those who don't like to sit when they work, or would like options.Coffee is fine, tea is good. Sandwiches are ok. I don't think any of the items they serve are extraordinary.Main complaint is that no matter what season, it's always freezing in there. I often have to wear my actual coat from outside in doors. Does not make me the most productive studier when I'm shivering.One good thing is that they have two walls with full windows, so there is a lot of natural light that gets in.","It has become tradition for me to visit an independent coffee shop in any city I travel to. I'm a big fan of Chemex/pour-over coffee, and I absolutely love third-wave coffee roasters and independent coffeeshops. I've had all the ""Big Three of Third Wave Coffee"" coffees - Stumptown, Intelligentsia, and Counter Culture - but this was my first time visiting a standalone Intelligentsia Coffee shop.This Intelligentsia was only a mere block from Millennium Park, so it was very conveniently located. I like the industrial feel which didn't diminish the coziness of the shop. There's a large coffee bar, behind which the baristas work their magic. There's a handful of seats available, but it can definitely fill up quick. If you are a fan of Chemex, V60, Siphon, and Cafe Solo, you will be satisfied with Intelligentsia's offerings. They also have espresso, cold brew iced coffee, chai, loose leaf tea, iced tea, matcha latte, and hot chocolate. I had their Chemex and their matcha latte, and both were fantastic. The baristas take great care in crafting the perfect cup for you. I like that for Chemex, they'll give you a cup of the brewed coffee and an additional decanter of extra coffee on a wooden tray. Free WiFi too!","This was an excellent dining experience, as soon as you walk into the establishment the smell of delicious well seasoned food. However you feel a little disoriented by the set up of how you order and find seating for your meal. I had the breakfast plate with pink panther limeade drink. The breakfast plate entails fresh light and fluffy pancakes, perfectly roasted potatoes, turkey sausage also including your choice style of eggs. Through yelp they also gave us a hot biscuit. In conclusions I really enjoyed the meal, Mars our waiter was perfect wish I knew that you pay before you eat, otherwise I would have given him a nice tip for his kind service. The cafe is really cozy and I can tell they love what they do. My only disappointment was the time length to receive the food could have been shorter, but otherwise I will be back for more!","Relaxing environment to chill and get some work done! Since it was UIC finals week, got to take advantage of their bottomless coffee deal!","First let me start with the decor and ambiance of this place. It's so rustic! Nice & Cozy. Something  that is well needed in Englewood. You walk in to a warm, genuine greeting! Nice, Neo-Soul music playing .... real dope! Now the food...I ordered the Chicken Funkadelic wrap. It was really tasty. My only complaint was that it was a bit messy.... when you bite into it- sauce squirts out the wrap so I needed a lot of napkins!   I ended up needing a knife and fork. I would recommend that they use less sauce on the sandwich.  I paired it with a fruit smoothie that was delicious!  The customer service was truly refreshing.  I would definently return to try their breakfast....",This place near the university of Chicago campus is a great lunch spot. The burgers are awesome. they have a fairly extensive menu. Nice service and a pretty cool atmosphere as well.,"I like the food here although it's expensive, and unlike other reviewers, I think the wait staff is very friendly and cool. Recently though, they've taken to forcing people to come in to order before they get settled in a seat. When this has happened to me, there has been ample seating and once the manager was very rude to me about it. I spend tons of money here so it feels particularly annoying and misguided on their part-- I'm not here to freeload a seat, I want food and drink. Sure, if someone is sitting down without ordering for an extended time and there's no seats, fine, but forcing a menu on someone who says they don't need it and will be in line to order soon, seems more like a good way to lose a regular customer rather than a smart business strategy.","Robust needs to take care of its respect for the local neighborhood ASAP. I have been there multiple times and seen the management behave incredibly inappropriately towards local HS students. Students cannot be told to their face they are ""good kids"" or ""bad kids."" The owner is especially disrespectful about this situation. It needs to be remedied right away."
22,"I just recently hosted an event at Gallery Cafe and loved every bit of my experience there. Geno is so nice and accommodating and the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was perfect for my meetup for about 25 guests. Everyone at the event complimented all of the artwork, the taste of the coffee (seriously, that Turtle Latte is the TRUTH!) and the overall relaxed vibe. Geno and his staff went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable, fully caffeinated and that we were enjoying ourselves. Seriously, one of the best cafe's in the city!","I love the outdoors, and this shop does a great job to invigorate that outdoors, cozy like them. I had their drip coffee and my girlfriend had their hot chocolate (she's not a coffee drinker LOL), and atmosphere is amazing. Always a pleasure being here.",First time stopping by and I must say it will be my last the red head cashier was just plan rude not friendly at all!,I really like this cafe. Very convenient right off the 606. It was very crowded but service was fast.They served these small donuts that came in six flavors. I tried all six. They had three that we're chocolate glazed. They were pretty small so you won't really be full but delicious.The iced coffee was quite amazing. One of the best I've had in a while. They also have a selection of beer which I will try next time.They had a decent amount of space to get work done and fast wifi.I will probably come here often to work.,"Bookstore cafes are my favorite kind of cafes. It just makes sense. Some people go to a cafe to read (especially if it's cold outside) and you want a nice cup of tea or coffee in a nice warm atmosphere. This is the place to go! Plus, it already comes with the books.They have one of my favorite matcha lattes in the city! I rarely get a grainy powder matcha texture that quite a few places give me. Before I found Volumes, I was only limited to Starbucks for a Matcha that was not overwhelmingly bitter. I also love that they have readings and talks there, too. You are able to sit in the cafe during a talk, but you have to stay quiet. So don't be afraid to go in and have a look.","A coffee shop gem that is right around the corner from my new spot. Lucky me!My go-to is their lavender mint latte with oat milk and activated charcoal. What's amazing is I don't even have to be boujie, (or however you spell it), they're already boujie themselves! #winThe inside is decked out with old school movie props (I'm never familiar with this sort of thing since I haven't seen nearly enough movies). They also offer a ton of free stickers with fun quotes. The only reason I give them 4 stars is because you can't come here when you're in a rush, like before work. Sometimes that's a great thing but it's too bad because now I can only enjoy them on a weekend.","This was the absolute perfect place to refuel after a tough workout in Lincoln Park! I'm from New York, so I judge any non-New York bagels PRETTY hard. I loved the everything bagel and would go everyday if it was closer to my apartment!At least over the weekend, the atmosphere would be great for catching up with a friend, rather than camping out with a laptop for 10 hours.I also have to shout out to the friendly service! Even though I was sweaty and basically nonverbal when I ordered, I was treated extremely well for a $6 bill!","We stopped here because they had juices and smoothies listed on their online menu and I am juicing. However, after a half hour wait at the crowded counter area in the back we were informed that they don't have any smoothies and only commercial juices. So I starved while my wife ordered an East of Eden sandwich, which she loved. Hence the five star. It's just two old houses that have only been mildly upgraded and turned into cafes with a bunch of wooden antique tables and chairs thrown together in a very bohemian mishmash. It works. Everyone is ontop of everyone else but it's an intelligentsia crowd and everyone just pretends like nobody else is there. I'll come back when I'm eating solid food again.","This latte is on point!  I was about to go to a nearby coffee shop which i liked just fine and told a newly local friends i was in his new neighborhoid getting coffee. He promptly suggested Cupitol as his nearby preference. SO thankful he did!  Ambience is cool with instrumental music with a beat playing, a good mix of tables, comfy chairs and high tables. Though most people were solo this Sunday morning, I could see this location being adaptable to chill time alone with a book, meeting a friend or two, or work/study time. I grabbed a scone. The selection of flavors was to tempting to pass up. Some traditional like Maple pecan, some a little more unique like ginger lemon and they even offered a savory selection cheddar-Apple.A case to the right contains fancy European-looking treats. From the looks of other guests tables, I'll have to come back and try a sandwich or juice concoction!If visiting Chicago like me, walk the extra few blocks for your coffee at Cupitol and you won't be disappointed.","he coffee is always excellent and service is friendly. I like the hipster decor and the bleacher seating. I ordered a breakfast sandwich for the first time today. A sausage biscuit with gouda and caramelized onions. Well...my mouth was not ready for balsamic caramelized onions early in the morning. It was a bit of a surprise but it was still good. And the biscuit was buttery, flaky, fluffy perfection.One thing I don't like...the step in the payment process where they ask you to add a tip to the order total (15%, 20%, 25%). I'm a little irritated with baristas getting tips to begin with, but when I only order a sandwich the cashier is asking me to tip her just for taking my order. Dislike.","Had a delicious Mexican spicy espresso coffee and an everything bagel with aioli! Amazing, people were nice but under staffed.","Ordered a mocha ""for here"" and it came in a great big cup, had some fun latte art, and was just the right amount of chocolate and coffee. Since visiting Chicago, my palate has definitely changed and I am not in desperate need for there to be a sweet component to my coffee anymore. With that said, the bittersweet of this mocha hit the spot, and anyone who may want to hit that chocolate and coffee fix in one go, this is the way to do it.The coffee shop has bar seating as well as lower sitting tables to meet a variety of needs, whether you just need a place to stand or if you're wanting to spend the afternoon there.","When you walk into this place, you forget that you just stepped out of the hood. I was greeted by the melodic sounds of a foreign land and the decor is a definite hipster vibe. Don't wait to be seated, walk directly up to the counter and place your order. You will received a number to place at your table (a la Nandos Peri Peri) and the server will bring you eats on out to you. Grab you drinks, if ordered, and your silverware,  before heading to the table you select. The service was quick and did not disappoint. I had the breakfast plate, which was a basic meal. Since becoming vegetarian, I'm always curious to see if restaurants will offer an alternative. The veggie sausage were, hands down, the best I've ever had. I don't reside in the area, but am around frequently. I can imagine that this place could become a part of the regular weekend ritual.","So I've been coming here almost every day for the past few weeks to change up my studying environment. I love this place for a few reasons: It stays open until 10 pm, which is why I started coming here. Most places close at 8 and 9 pm in this area. Love the long picnic style tables, bright lighting, and open layout. The tables are great for group meetings and for people like me who just like to spread out with my books and laptop. The music here is great. Sometimes it's a bit loud but never too intrusive. I love how they play artist's whole albums. I've discovered a few new people I like just from listening to the baristas picks for music each night.  The baristas are friendly and remember regulars even though this place is full of students every day. Drinks are great and they usually do a little latte art on my cappuccinos which always brightens your day :)","The owner is awesome and makes sure that everything in the restaurant is sustained from the community around it, from the employees to the art to the food. Staff was very friendly. Food takes about 10 minutes to come, but all the sandwiches are very excellent. Can't go wrong. No wait at 11:30 on a weekday, before lunch rush",Went to grab a late lunch here after spending the day at the museum of science and industry. There wasn't a long wait around 5 pm on a Saturday as we were seated right away. The staff was friendly and the food was good and way cheaper than the museum cafeteria. The portion size was large as well.,"I had the two egg any style breakfast and it was the perfect size and fairly priced. The iced coffee was a large glass and very tasty! Service was great, inside and outside seating. Cute little place-would recommend.",My children have been long time patrons of Robust Coffee because it is within walking distance from their school however the lack of respect and appreciation for the students and staff who are the main contributors to their success is unacceptable.
23,"the place has greatly improved ever since new management took over! creative atmosphere with local artists' pieces featured on the walls for sale and succulents at all the tables, delicious food and drinks for $5, strong wifi, great music, big windows make for lots of natural light and a view for people-watching :)",By far the best coffee shop I've ever been to. The baristas are NOT your stereotypical mean coffee hipster snobs - they are SO NICE. I love this place...,"$3.91 for a small coffee? You've got to be kidding me. The coffee was nice, the facility was clean and wonderful. But 4 dollars, 5 with tip, for a 10oz coffee is insane. When did this become a thing?","I stopped here on a recommendation from a friend, although I am not in this neighborhood often. I came in here to buy beans, because I love trying all of the great Chicago-based coffee companies. I was having trouble choosing the beans I wanted, and the barista was very helpful in talking me through the different coffees to find something that I would like. I ended up choosing a gift box with the three Panama coffees, all of which were absolutely delicious. I love that Ipsento tries unique flavors with their coffee. While in the shop, I also purchased a cappuccino and one of the mini donuts! Everything tasted great and came out quickly. There were a lot of people in the shop at around 10am on a Thursday, so I can imagine this coffee is well-loved by the neighborhood.Overall, I am very impressed with the coffee and the service at Ipsento. I look forward to returning when I find myself in the area!",We sought out Volumes on a Wicker Park tour of bookstores. Enjoyed reading and getting some new books for myself and kids.,"Nothing wrong with a nostalgia trip now and then (heck I dressed up my son in vintage Ocean Pacific for 80's day).  From the movie posters to Doc Brown's DeLorean, there are bits and bobs of fun pop kitsch all around to catch your eye and steer your conversation away from it's topic for a bit. My friend and I met up for caffeine and convo and loved pace of this coffee shop. Great place to work, read or meet up. My honey latte was delicious and the croissant was perfectly buttery and flaky. There's table seating, communal work table and comfy couches. Laid back friendly vibe.  Can't wait for Max Headroom to start working the counter.",The Bagelers is great! Lovely ambiance - lots of seating available - plus friendly service and tasty bagels. They were all out of the bagel I ordered so they gave me a coupon for a free bagel next visit.,"I had heard of this place but didn't realize how close it was to my apartment. As a graduate student, I was looking for a nearby place to get some good coffee and spend a few hours studying and the Bourgeois Pig nailed it! During our time there, we had two lattes, a PSL, and a drip coffee. All were very good, but I do wish they had been in actual mugs rather than to-go cups. Just a personal preference and perhaps they were too busy to have time to bus and wash dishes. I ordered a breakfast panini and my partner the deluxe waffle. The panini had crazy delicious ham and was very tasty and filling, though I see now I was never offered a tomato as promised and it came with the tiniest side of fruit. My partner was a bit disappointed with the ""deluxe""part of her waffle as it was pretty lackluster, but I personally think ordering waffles at a restaurant will never result in satisfaction. I would say stick to the sandwiches here as it seems to be their forte. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering it was a busy Saturday morning. Maybe twenty minutes tops? I also need to mention the baked goods they had to offer looked very good. I plan on trying a scone next visit for sure. While I picked on a few things above, what really gets this place 5 stars is the delicious coffee and the ample space to study in a unique and relaxing environment. Don't be fooled by the small space where you order food and drinks. They have an adorable patio, another space next door, and ANOTHER space upstairs to that. The ambience is great and you can find a bustling spot or a quiet corner with some lovely jazz playing above it all. There is PLENTY of room and if you order food and head next door, the server will come find you to deliver it. Hopefully management will be able to fix what other Yelpers have mentioned regarding wait times and also make sure no shortcuts are taken when it comes to their food and coffee. For now, I stick with my 5 stars and will be back to enjoy the cafe again.","Cupitol has it all! Technically an all day lounge, they have a surprisingly extensive menu (including alcohol). I dropped in Sunday morning to grab a coffee and get some work done. It was busy, but I was still able to get a seat just fine because the space is expansive. Everything is ordered up at the counter, and if you get food they'll take your table number and bring it to you. They also clear your table for you when you're finished. Which was great because they were really on top of their game and everything was super clean/organized.It was hot this morning so I went for an iced latte (16 oz) and an avocado wrap. Came out to ~$12. Both were perfect and I'd get them again. Other Yelpers have noted higher prices but I'd argue the quality was great and this is a main drag to Navy Pier - I can only imagine how much it costs to lease this location. So I can only hope they're here to stay, because from amazing customer service to great food and drinks, Cupitol is doing everything right and it's working.","Best coffee in the area and convenient ordering ahead on Ritual, but forget about a quick stop to order in person. When they are slammed the one person making drinks keeps his/her leisurely pace while the employees not doing anything at the register or in the back wander around.","This location is spacious and lots of natural lighting (thanks to the ceiling high windows on two sides). Free wifi. Coffee is decent. Baked goods are OK. Haven't tried the sandwiches yet, but will one of these days. Service is good. My preferred drink here is the Honey Cinnamon Latte. Good spot to grab a cup of coffee and read.",I was in need of a good cup of coffee. I knew Intelligentsia was the place I wanted to go. Quiet little place. Only a few people with their laptops out.. a few tables of friends catching up.. ya know like how grabbing coffee used to be. Countertop areas for the solo coffee Connoisseur.. light pastries to accompany your coffee or tea.. brightly lit. As for the explanation of the type of coffee used in my latte... it didn't happen.. only reason for the 4 star review.,This place is just awesome. Love the food. Delicious coffee and tea creations. Great music. Man I love this place. I'm going to enjoy this place because soon enough it'll be too packed.,"Thank goodness, at last a bright spacious coffee house open late! Rare on the Southeast Side.","Nice cozy spot, great for a cup of coffee, the staff is super friendly and best part is very community- driven","""People let me tell you about the best place!""Parking is a bit hard but you will always get a lucky park in the front. Let's start by saying there's a ROOFTOP! Oh. Even better?! BYOB. I usually get the pizza it's great I absolutely love this place and the customer service. They even have an ice cream shop/bakery next door. Wonderful place to go with friends during summertime Chi!","ice mocha was excellent, the environment is really lovely and peaceful. Though they close early (accustomed to California's cafes which close at midnight).","If you want to be treated like crap and experience the neighborhood teenagers being treated like worse than crap, come here.  I work in the neighborhood and have never experienced such poor service (20 minute wait for a bagel, old veggies with their hummus plate, wrong items in the order). It's one thing to treat me poorly (I have a car and can go elsewhere easily), but a completely different story when you're just plain disrespectful to the young people who go to the high school just down the block. You would think they would join forces with the school, but from what I have witnessed, they are just plain evil to the kids for no reason other than they are kids.  Be sure to bring a fat wallet. You don't get out of here cheap."
24,"I've been there a total of three times and every time my coffee tasted like an ashtray. Not only the coffee is terrible, the service is even worse. The owner is rude and incompetent. The last time I was the only person at the shop and I had to repeat 4 times that I wanted a vanilla biscotti, not chocolate, for which I got an eye roll as though my order was a huge bother to her. PS Also there is a $5 min on debit/credit cards. Considering a coffee there is under $5, it always forces you to buy something else.","Tried this place while visiting Chicago. It's a great coffee shop, as others have described, very spacious which makes it a nice coffee shop for studying. It has a variety of table arrangements which are even suitable for larger groups. My latte was perfect, didn't need any sugar or anything added to it which is always a good sign. Kitchen closes ealry (at around 3pm) so if you want food, be sure to order it early!","You should really change your hours to ""when our baristas feel like opening"" I came after 7 am on a Saturday and the guy inside rudely shhaked his head and went back to what he was doing. Maybe my skin color doesn't represent an acceptable customer to buy your ridiculously overpriced drinks. So I will stop buying this brand altogether. I know there are much better brands out there.",This is probably one of the best coffee spot I found in Chicago. Heard very good things but after visiting I am impressed. A cozy place for evening get together or if u just want to relax. Ipsento has great coffee latte and great cocktails. We gotNutella latte and Mexican nitro coffee (with tequila). #funnightwithfriends #nightout,"I'd give this place a 3 for food/coffee but a 4 for environment. I still haven't gotten accustomed to Metropolis coffee- it's too sour for my taste. Berry scone had a good filling but was too dry. Wonderful place to study though, with lots of outlets and plenty of comfy seating (I came here because Wormhole was full, and was not disappointed to find ample seating). Will revisit when I need to get work done. The Harry Potter themed drinks were very creative, I will try those next time as well!","Wormhole is such a cozy coffee shop with a very friendly and attentive, great regular and iced coffee, and rotating specialty drinks.There are a number of different seating options, even a couch with video games. Plenty of outlets, as well.","Ordered 5 items on Uber Eats and only received 2 out of 5. I was very hungry so I wanted the rest of the food instead of the refund. Messaged Uber Eats who said I would receive a response within 24 hours. Then I called the restaurant. First of all the guy on the phone didn't even apologize for what happened after I explained the situation to him. Then he informed me that I had to contact Uber Eats directly to resolve the matter, even though it was the restaurant that screwed up. To top it off the guy hung up on me. Would not recommend.","Love the vibe in this place, very hipster-y and quaint. The coffee tastes average is priced basically like any other hipster coffee shop. I'd mostly come back here to relax and lay back. Oh yea, and terrible service. Took about 20-25 mins just to take an order.","We love this spot for lattes and loose teas. It's a great atmosphere for kicking back and unwinding, or even completing some light work. Cozy, clean, spacious cafe with ample seating and Latte: 5 (the crema was beautiful and the espresso had the perfect notes)Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice: 5Cinnamon Saigon Loose tea: 5  (Teas are served in a French Press.)Avocado egg wrap with wheat tortilla: 4.5Service: 5","Dollop is my favorite place to grab a great cup of coffee for a morning treat or an afternoon pick-me-up. They serve Metropolis Coffee, which is rich and decadent and just downright delicious. You pay a little more than you would at Starbucks, but I think every penny is worth it for the quality and selection.","Dollop has a lovely modern atmosphere with a very very high ceiling and cute comfy seats. All-glass wall windows facing the east and being located between Streeterville and Atwater's towers, makes a wonderful coffee shop for a morning sit down with friends before they go to O'Hare (the usual time I come here) or if you want to work on laptop. Their coffee is just ok. Spicy cinnamon latte was good. Nutella mocha was good too. I prefer Starbucks Reserve coffee over coffee here, but the atmosphere here is the best. Baristas are not that friendly here to my experience so far. Snooty is the best word. This place is most perfect for a college student, a resident or fellow working on a research project or for a gathering with coffee vampires friends.","INTELLIGENTSIA! I've finally made it! I first heard about Intelligentsia while watching the documentary ""Barista"". I immediately knew that this was one of *the* places to go if you want legit coffee from legit baristas (I'm sorry Starbucks, I promise I'll return to basic once I get back home!). The Black Cat cappuccino was absolutely divine! Perfect ratio of espresso, milk, and foam and beautiful presentation. I also tried just the Black Cat espresso and it was smoooooth! This location is a short walk from Millennium Park and the baristas were very professional and friendly. Seating is limited and the place can get pretty packed during peak hours, but don't let that deter you from trying Chicago's best coffee!","I love this place. It feels like love and home. Like I'm in a wondrous land of beautiful Blackness when I walk in. The music, the people, THE FOOD, the gorgeous staff, the decor, the vibe, the Jet magazine covers on the wall... it's soothing to my soul. I had the blue plate for lunch. Fried catfish (crispy and well seasoned) + greens (smooth as butter, perfect mix of savory and tang), red beans (creamy and well seasoned), white rice with stew tomatoes on top (the stew tomatoes was delectable) + a biscuit with the homemade preserves (fluffy, light and buttery, preserves were AMAZING). It took everything in my damn power to not drink the pot likka from the plate. I believe the entree is $12. Best $12 I've ever spent.",Dollop is an awesome coffee shop north of campus and they have awesome customer service! They've got lots of seating so you don't have to worry about not having a place to enjoy your coffee or food. Awesome music in the background gives it that classic coffee shop vibe that students will definitely enjoy to socialize and study in. It's great!,"Hip little non-profit cafe in Englewood, doing great things for the community. Staff was extremely friendly and engaging. Great decor, food that's good & reasonable. We got the Lupe Tabasco & a large coffee but FYI a large coffee is VERY LARGE, basically a bowl lol, but there's nothing wrong with that!","I've been coming here since I was a little kid and not much has changed except maybe more graffiti on the tables and walls. Neat atmosphere and there's a good mix between locals and college kids. The menu is straight forward with nothing too unusual. They are connected to their bakery and all of the bread is homemade. If you get a chance, check out their cinnamon rolls!","This cafe attempts to provide interesting breakfast selections, pastry, and quality coffee in an aesthetic setting just north of Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House bordering U. of Chicago's main campus.   While the breakfast selections are above average in imagination and they purport to take pride in their coffee, the execution is lacking. The first tip-off was that my drip coffee was not sufficiently hot and my partner's latte was lacking in coffee flavor.  The omelet I ordered was properly cooked in a frittata style, but the accompanying red potatoes were underdone.  My partner had asked for eggs over hard.  Oddly, while the two eggs on her plate appeared to have been cooked in the same pan, one of them was correctly hard and the other was still runny.  She experienced the same issue with her side of potatoes as I did.  Her order also include veggie sausage patties which were properly cooked with surprisingly good texture and flavor.All in all, while Plein Aire Cafe has laudable ambitions, they did not hit the mark for us this morning.","Oh my goodness. Great vibe, great food, robust coffee. Chill vibe, spacious, great place for meetings. Highly recommend checking out this spot!"
25,Awesome spot for the early bird. Wonderful art on the walls and great service - you may sit outside too.  thumbs up. Great latte and menu,"The coffee at Gaslight is really good--cappuccinos are made well and the milk is high quality. They roast their own beans, too! Further, I really liked the cheese scone--it was fresh and reasonably priced.The downside here is the music--while we were here, the baristas were playing some really loud, really obnoxious music (think experimental chainsaw quartet). Even through my large, over-the-ear headphones it was grating. Maybe they were in a weird mood? In any case, to those hoping to get some work done: beware the cafe DJ.",One of the best coffee places in Chicago.The baristas are friendly and actually seem interested in the customer. Had the Cortado and a Chemex cause it was just that kind of day.Wife had the vanilla latte cause she's got to have something sweet.Atmosphere is inviting for both people that come here to get work done and those that come to just talk and chill!,"Stopped by this place after another hot chocolate bar was closed for the holidays and I must say Wow! We ordered an Iced Nutella Latte, Basil Mint Mocha, Hot Chocolate, Vanilla Latte, and a dozen donuts. Iced Nutella Latte - I was very surprised! Often these drinks come out too sweet, but this stuck the right balance without being very bitter. Basil Mint Mocha - You can really taste the basil! Recommended as a nice warm drink. Hot Chocolate - Rich and creamy, yum!Vanilla Latte - One of the best lattes I have tasted. Donuts - These are so mini! When I was looking at the reviews I didn't realize that the donuts were mini because they are so detailed! We bought a dozen and they came in a cute little box. Atmosphere - very warm and comfortable, I could spend a lot of time here!","Went there yesterday and now volumes is my favorite coffee place! Good service, fast internet and the BEST LATTE I'VE EVER TRIED!thank you",Good latte and chocolate chip croissant. Neat decor inside with Back to the future Delorean inside. Not sure if it's one from movie but definitely a Delorean. Nice indie coffeeshop vibes!!,"It's a small cafe covered in art from local artists that is available for purchase. Perfect for a quick bite, a relaxing place, or a spot to hang out and have a conversation while sipping on coffee or eating a bagel. Absolutely loved their smoked salmon bagel sandwich. They were very generous with the salmon and the sandwich over all was amazing. The vanilla latte was excellent it looked to me like they used actual vanilla which elevated it that much more. I will absolutely be back.","I love this place!! The  sandwiches are awesome, the cookies scones and muffins are fresh baked, and I think they have the best coffee in the city. Also some of the most reasonable prices in Lincoln Park!","sigh!Yet another lukewarm latte when we popped in to see friends off to the airport. The ridiculously overpriced Gravlax Bagels ($9.00 each) arrived with a tiny, bologna slice of pale ""house cured salmon"", a teaspoon smear of caper-flavored cream cheese and ribbons of cucumber on a tough, chewy bagel. I'm officially done - Too pricy. Too tepid.","I made my first trip into Dollop today after passing it almost everyday on my way to work. I judge every coffee shop by their almond milk cappuccino.  If you don't offer almond milk, I won't even order, so props to Dollop for carrying it.  I also appreciated the fact that they have Harmless Harvest Coconut Water and Rx Bars.  However, that's where my positive experience ends.  My medium cappuccino was almost $6 and it tasted bitter.  It was reminiscent of Starbucks bitterness, which I can't stand. It also had almost no froth.  (I realize it's more difficult to froth almond milk but I assure you it can be done - Rom does it perfectly).  I am afraid Dollop is 1 and done for me.","I got Iced latte, the coffee was really good. The service, not so much. The person who took my order didn't even look up the entire time, and the place wasn't even that busy. Disappointing. I'd have liked to come back because it has a great vibe going on and is actually very spacious, but I won't. I like the service better in the West loop one.","This place is the WORST. One of their employees is pissed off all the time, refuses to make eye contact or be pleasant, and literally scowls at patrons. How does someone like this remain employed? Additionally, everything takes forever and a day. And the drinks are gross. The cream is subpar, the coffee itself is bitter and reddish colored, and their specialty drinks are even worse. My iced mocha had clumps of chocolate in it. Wtf? Avoid this place at all costs.","Yaaaaaaaaaaaassssss!!! This place looks so hipster, whaaaaaaat??? It's so open! And they got that matcha????????? Whaaaaaaaaat??? S/N: Usually vegans or Whole Food shoppers know what matcha is. It's a type of green tea powder with mad caffeine. So I came here yesterday with my Dad and cousin. Its literally 4 blocks walking from my crib. 4. Legit.""Yaaaaaaassssss Queeeeen!""  *snaps fingers dramatically in a downward Z*(I'm wilin' this morning... please bare with me! )I had a meal with grapefruit, a biscuit, and a hard boiled egg. Yes I'm on a diet, bih summer is coming!  I ended up eating half of another biscuit and a side of turkey sausage.  Don't judge me!!! My dad had potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit...AND the chocolate mocha coffee. When I tell you this was SO GOOD!!!! OMG. I look at my Green goddess matcha iced latte like, 'Why can't I be great, and fat? Hmmm?' I can't. Omg.So my cuz had a Texas toast, egg, cheddar, and turkey sausage sandwich. She said it was buttered,  toasted, and cooked to perfection. And the eggs were so good and just had cheddar on 'em.*Throws hands to the sky and screams* Yaaas Laaaawd!!!! (Told you I am on one today...)So im geeked BECAUSE I'm waiting to go again today with my bestie.  #Winning#BlackOwned #ServiceIsGreat #BlackHippie #SouthSide #ThatFoodSmackin AND THEIR PRICES ARE REASONABLE! We paid $36 for 3 people!!!! 3!!! yupppp.",Hey! I love working out of your Hyde Park space. There's so much space and great wifi. Everyone was so friendly even though I was making changes to my food (celiac struggles). Do you per chance have a printer? I've been having to go to Cafe 53 to get my prints.,"My daughter bought a pack of your Ethiopian coffee for me yesterday.  It was so good that I read the menu, looked at the photos and now I'm hungry for their breakfast and lunch.  I will be there next week","Went mid-day on Sunday. Everything went well. Love the thin crust spinach, goat cheese pizza.","I'm hooked.... This place is truly as good as it gets for coffee and cafe food, but at the same time, the place is absolutely packed all the time and the coffee drinks are priced like the premium coffee drinks they are. I love the yogurt and granola - it comes with super thick Greek style yogurt, housemade granola, a ton of berries, a homemade strawberry compote, and banana slices. It's delicious, filling, and totally instagram-able. I've had dirty chais here on a couple of occasions and they have really hit the perfect balance of sweet and spicy with their chai!However, heed my warning - it is super easy to spend $20 here on a fancy coffee and lunch - that being said most menu items are around $9... but then you get a $5.50 coffee drink and decide that croissant looks ambrosial... and you've spent way more than you intended and you still haven't figured out where you're going to sit because it's packed.","Why? Just why does the music need to be blasted so loud like I'm in an 80's nightclub? Thank goodness I had headphones but I could still hear it. I asked the cashier, with my fingers close together in a pinch gesture could the music be turned down just a teensy bit. She said ""I guess we can turn it down a little. It's probably not as loud in the back."" I explained that I was meeting someone who was already set up in the front. But guess what? I had already thought of that solution but I could STILL hear it back there so that's actually why I asked could they turn it down. I don't understand why the volume had to be SO loud when most people were working or trying to have conversations. And a request, not to turn it off because that would be kinda ridiculous, but to turn it down just a little, was not even honored. I think Atlantic Starr or Evelyn Champagne King was playing just as loud if not louder as I sat there. Ugh I used to like this place."
26,"This place is such a gem! Both the coffee and the people are wonderful. The breakfast sandwiches are my favorite - very filling and large portions. Most of all, the vibes are super chill and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. I love that they support artists and musicians, and they are continuously engaged with the local community. Highly recommend!","Awesome space with a lot of natural light and seating. Service was really friendly. I enjoyed my latte and I'll be back to try more of their options since their coffee is high-quality.My only complaint is the music. I was there for a few hours and the whole time it was some strange French/Italian rock playlist? Idk, but it was somewhat obnoxious to have on at a coffee shop. It was too loud for headphones to block it out.",Incredible coffee but $4.50 for a 16oz...that's steep compared to others in the area. Great coffee shop and vibe for wicker park,"Came in here to grab coffee the other day.. cute coffee store, it was crowded with people going in and out. There were people on laptops sitting in there drinking their drinks. I needed coffee and it's a block away from where I am staying. The cashier was friendly and I got my coffee right away. I would come back here for coffee or try one of the other drinks on the menu.","This bookstore is truly a hidden gem! I first noticed this bookstore because they claimed to be a coffee shop as well. As a coffee addict and bookworm, I knew this cafe was calling my name. The interior design of this bookcase is so modern, clean, and organized. I would come here to study/read/work everyday if I lived in the area. They hold reading/speaking performances every so often. They also host authors at this bookstore, so I would definitely recommend stopping by to possibly run into an author ;)",One of the best places for coffee in Chicago. I got their vanilla latte last time I was there and it was delicious. I've also gotten their regular coffee and really enjoyed it. They have a good selection of sweet coffee drinks with solid black coffee as well. They have a small selection of baked goods but you can't go wrong with their croissants. The staff are super friendly and the staff is super attentive at keeping the space clean. The space itself is very cool. There's a lot of comfy seating and you could actually play their old 90's games. The controllers were a little old and didn't work quite right but it was still cool to see. If you're in the area definitely stop by or even if you're not in the area it's close to the L!,"in house kettle boiled bagels! need I say more. I got the bagelier and it was perfect. the first bite you could tell the bagels were fresh. I wish I could try every bagel they had and all the in house spreads. maybe next time. if you are close to this location and they are open please stop in great service, great food, and great prices.","I used to love this place, but it's taken a plunge since two years ago. And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, I went there two days ago. The place is like a post-apocalyptic scene, barely anyone there, and a confused-looking barista behind the counter. I asked for a drop coffee, they said they could make me an americano.  No, I would like a drip. Sorry but we're closing soon. It was 5:30 PM on a Monday. This is a cafe that usually stays open till 10, even in the summer, but they keep changing and shortening their hours every other week. It's just so sad. The last four times I've been here, the drip has always been cold, the barista confused and forgetful, and the place a mess.","Delicious little cafe. Even though it is a cafe, my food took restaurant time to be ready tho. I just ordered an omelet but it wasn't ready for 30 minutes, which sucked because I was kind of in a hurry. I don't know if it was just a fluke or not, but the staff did apologize for the wait. I had the Spanish Omelet and it was really good, especially if you love breakfast with a light kick because it has spicy chorizo and jalapeños.No Pokémon around tho...  Which was a bummer. Only 4 stars.",Good Americano. I went in the evening so it wasn't crowded. Price was about $3 for an 8oz. The inside has great seating for people watching outside. I'd like to go back to try the food and specialty drinks.,"Sooo i yelped a coffee house being a tourist in chicago and not wanting a starbucks. Thanks to previous yelpers i was very pleased with the moment i walked in the door. The industrial vibe and unique menu were exciting.. i didn't know what i wanted and the 2 gitls behind the counter helped me with some explanations and suggestions. I went with the cold latte with oatmeal milk...because they were out of almond milk. Lucky me because it was decadent, creamy, smooth and rich with flavour and depth...it took me an hour to drink it. Knocked Starbucks out of the park!!  The coffee jousecwas full of energy with computer techies and  couples enjoying a quick conversation before going back to work. Bright blue chairs on the patio with dog bowls of water were inviting. Bathrooms were newly decorated, homey and very clean. There is a reward program for frequent flyers visting there locations in Uptown, Lakeview, Streeterville (x2), Evanston, The Loop (x3), Ukrainian Village, and now Hyde Park.   come for the vibe, the fresh eggs, meats and Ukrainian pastries","Had a Chai Latte, which was perfectly balanced. Delicious foam. Savory scone was nice and tasty.",Great place to eat at.....services and good was awesome......... our server was really nice he gave us a lot of hit tips we're definitely going to come back here and hang out love this place,,"I love everything about this place-- the food, the drinks, the staff, the style, the way the cafe strives to support its community... everything. Delicious food and coffee drinks for less than you'll find them at other cafes, and the atmosphere is very relaxed and cozy. Highly recommend!","Updated Review:     Not much has changed with Medici over the years, it's still hangover food that's right up your alley if you're a nearby student with a forgivable palate.    Nestled in the heart of Chicago's liberal Hyde Park, we dined here last night with renewed expectations, nothing new happened.   Non-diverse wait staff were accommodating, but the Goat Cheese pizza was forgettable, so was the grilled tuna thingee.   Nice place to chill and converse, just don't expect great tasting food.","Great coffee, environment, and food. Definitely give their sandwiches a try. Their kale and mushroom pie was also great.","Nice space. Staff are ok, some friendly some not. First time I went they apologized for taking so long. Second time took really long too, but this time I got attitude for asking. I hope they fix the speed. I personally won't find out."
27,"Eh probably won't come back, the employees were very kind, so they get a  4 star review, but the latte was awful, espresso is supposed to be a little sweet and slightly bitter the milk foamy and creamy. This espresso tasted of cleaner and burnt. I don't know if it was burnt in roasting or what but I don't think it was done well at all. Because after the third remake of the drink it was bad. Try changing out the beans or something? The sandwich was just bland, not a lot of flavor and when you see avocado expect the worlds smallest smear if the stuff. I just wish it had something more to it, or even just more avocado. I don't think I will make an effort to go back in to The Gallery Cafe, which is sad because I was so excited to finally try this place. Oh well, I guess there are people who like it or it wouldn't be in business. Well on to the next coffee shop I guess.","Well, my latte was tasty so nothing to complain about there. The staff seemed pleasant and friendly. The place itself is very quiet so good if you're trying to study or get work done; a bit awkward if you want to talk with friends. Not sure that this would be my first coffee shop option but it got the job done.","Love having an Intelligentsia in Wicker Park.Every time I go in here, the baristas couldn't possibly be nicer. They are always asking me about my day, my plans, etc...even when I look like I woke up about 7 minutes before I entered their shop. I really appreciate how friendly they are especially on a busy Chicago corner.The coffee is top notch. I wish they had skim milk (eye roll from my husband) but I appreciate that they value their coffee flavor so much that they choose not to offer skim milk. If they feel that strongly about it, that's fine with me.The interior is easy and not pretentious. One large communal table, a full window bench seating area, and lots of extra seating on interesting looking orange blocks. An easy place to take a cup to go or enjoy a great conversation.","I came here with a friend around 1PM on a weekday, and it was quite empty. I got a hibiscus berry cold tea and an ipsento donut. I also had half the hibiscus donut. The tea was quite average but good, and the donut was really small. Flavor could have been bolder for sure for the donuts; the frosting on the hibiscus didn't really taste like anything. It was also really expensive; each tiny donut was $1 and the tea was $4. And lots of ice in the cup. They serve the tea in jars though which is nice. I do like the ambience of the place!","One of the most wonderful bookstores i've ever been at. With a vast selection of coffee to enjoy at the seating area, Volumes book cafe provides a very comfortable vibe to do work or read at.bookshelves have short synopsis written by staffs, recommending intriguing and exciting staff picks. Volume bookstores feels very welcoming and seems like a great place for any book lovers to hang out at.","What a great find! My boyfriend and I happened to walk by this coffee shop and I'm so glad he convinced me to check this place out. Walking into the coffee shop, we immediately loved the 80's and 90's decor with the Delorean from Back to the Future, the old school Apple computer and floppy disks, and all the movie poster paraphernalia displayed everywhere. I ordered the cortado and my boyfriend ordered an iced mocha. Our coffee came out extremely fast and I loved it! The cortado was strong (just the way I like it). My boyfriend also enjoyed his iced mocha. In addition, the staff are super friendly. I will definitely keep this place in mind the next time we're in town.","This place has a great assortment of bagels, sandwiches, and salads. Music was great, staff is kind & accommodating, the coffee isn't bad either. Plenty of places to work from (small tables) and located on a great street near restaurants, other coffee houses, and a small park. One of my favorite small/quieter cafes to get work done in.","I've gotten food for take out here a few times (chicken parm panini, veggie panini, great gatsby) and they were average -- so I have been on the fence for a little while.    Today, I went to get a breakfast sandwich. It took 45+ minutes, and it is somehow missing ingredients and cold! I am probably not coming back.","Excellent breakfast! I've never had such fluffy eggs! This was or first stop after landing in Chicago and boy was it a great welcome to a great city! In addition to the fluffy eggs the hash browns were also the crispiest and butteriest. Maybe I was just really hungry, but I think this was one of my top 3 breakfasts ever! Also, the iced cinnamon tea is AMAZING! Unlike anything I've ever tasted before. Please stop here if you find yourself in Chicago!","I had my first Dollop experience and will never go back. My latte took too long to prepare and when I received it, it was served luke warm. The team could also use training in sanitation. I saw one of the baristas stick his finger in someone's drink to remove something. The cashier who took my order went to the back to prepare my bagel without washing her hands. No thanks!","I've been here twice and and both times I ordered coffee. The first time I ordered the Mexican mocha w/ 3 Chile blend and it was pretty good! What I liked about it was that it was different from your typical coffee and the Chile blend gave it strong distinct spicy flavor. It kinda confuses your taste buds haha (but in a good way in my opinion!). The second time (today) I ordered the Honey Cinnamon Latte and it was pretty good! Not as wild in flavor as the Mexican mocha but  definitely something I would order again this fall. It wasn't packed either times I've visited. People usually come here to study or get work done.There is a cute little couch area that is usually always taken, tables with outlets and outdoor seating for when the weather is nice! I really liked the layout and vibe of this coffee shop and if I lived around the area I would definitely consider getting work done here!","The oat latte is what people search for their entire lives. It's a latte so perfectly crafted it deserves to be in sears. Get it? Craftsman? No. Okay. But seriously, try it iced. It's just so yum.","Currency Exchange is a great example of a place for everyone. We went again this morning. The service is warm and attentive. The French toast was...fresh, homemade whipped cream with spices. Perfect. The coffee is some of my favorite in the city. And that $3 biscuit is worth it.  The grits too were YUMMY!",,An Oasis in a desert. Do as I did and stop in and enjoy every bit of it. The food the coffee the ambiance. You won't walk away disappointed.,"I live close by Medici and am a repeat customer. It's one of Hyde Park's best breakfast spots, as you'll see by the lines if you go during peak times. Despite being frequently busy, the service is always good, and the food usually comes out quickly. I always get the vegetable omelet and it's nothing revolutionary, just a good veggie omelet. The bread is made in-house and is delicious (all the baked goods I've ever tried are great). I've only ever had one bad meal here, and it was the salmon omelet. I will never order salmon from this place again, but everything else has been really good.","This review is solely for the mushroom pie. Because that's all I've ever tried here. It is SO hearty and filling. Definitely worth the ~$12.  It's great that it's so close to so many buildings on campus. I also heard that their coffee is good, but I'm not enough of a coffee aficionado to walk over just for a different coffee when we have coffee in the building.","This is a perfect little coffee spot with so much more to offer than just coffee. Although there can be a wait it's sooo worth it for anything on their menu. Their coffee selection is extensive, their smoothie options are great, but the best part are the milkshakes here. Cannot recommend the Oreo Shake enough! It's a perfect blend of Oreos and ice cream not making it overwhelming sweet. And the Espresso milkshake comes in second best."
28,"The staff here are passionate and knowledgeable about the coffee they roast in-house and serve! Not to mention they are super accommodating, and friendly. It's super awesome to see the roaster at work, and it gives off a delightful smell. The coffee and the smoothies at Gallery are really delicious, and so are the pastries, which are made locally! There's a lot of great art covering the walls as well making it a cozy and cool place to hang out and do work. The location of the cafe is also super accessible. There's a bus stop right in front and is only a couple blocks away from the blue line!","My girlfriend and I were staying nearby and came in on a rainy Saturday morning.It has a nice corner location with lots of natural light. The inside is pretty spacious with a few tables. It is a good local coffee shop to socialize, work, or people-watch. It's quiet but not awkwardly silent and not boring. Hipster would be a very accurate way to describe the place, but not in any kind of negative context.I got a cappuccino, my girlfriend a hot chocolate, and we split a ham & cheese croissant. Both of our drinks were delicious and the croissant was better than expected too. It is easy to tell that Gaslight offers quality coffee products and even food. I did notice some other food items that I would certainly like to try next time I'm in.It is a little pricey for what it is, although not much out of reach compared to something like Starbucks.Great local spot in Logan Square!","Damn their matcha latte is incredible. Everyone has always been super friendly upon walking in. I've never had a bad cup of coffee here either. This is my ultimate favorite place to get coffee or matcha lattes on the go. I do wish it was less expensive, but it's totally worth every penny.","I love the original Ipsento and every location that's come since then, Ipsento 606 being no exception. It's coffee, but it's not regular coffee. It seems like everything they do they add a little magical twist to it. I have always been a big fan of their cardamom rose lattes but on my visit here the Pumpkin Patch Latte called to me. It's not at all like going to Starbucks so don't worry if you think you're too cool for an SBux PSL. This is not that (though I won't hate on those either). Their Pumpkin Patch Latte just tastes real. Like, real food, real ingredients. There's no question of artificial additives because you can taste how pure this  puppy is. Made with real pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and local pumpkin coconut syrup, it is a divine treat on a perfect Autumn Chicago day.","This an amazing place to have a coffee, meet up with friends to catch up, or just get some work done.Their book selection is great, and it's fun talking about different books/ series with the owners. They have a great kids book area that makes it easy for your kiddos to have something to do while you're sipping or browsing. They have a full events calendar and have something fun to take part in any day of the week! Check them out!","I have come here a few times with a girlfriend of mine who lives in the area. The coffee is tasty- I love me some cold brew! Their muffins are delicious, too!The place has a retro/hipster style and I enjoy the fact that the seating is set in a way that you sit next to strangers while you all are doing your own thing. And since I love meeting new people, it sets up that opportunity, too.The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the service is kind of abrupt and not as friendly as it could be. Otherwise, I enjoy hanging out here for a coffee&reading session.","The Bageler on and Everything bagel is AMAZING. Stopped in for lunch, coffee, and a workspace for an afternoon and was not disappointed. Reliable WiFi, friendly staff, delicious coffee, free water, clean restrooms, gorgeous local art on display and for sale. I will definitely return.","I love this place, I come here at least once a week, they've got a great espresso, my favorite thing to get is their Jamaican Latte, I'm a big fan of the warm allspice flavor. They've got a great location right off the Fullerton CTA stop, cute and trendy interior, outdoor seating is plentiful and beautiful in the spring and summer. My only qualm is with their pastries, most of them seem like their store bought, but I usually don't get em anyways. Their sandwiches, however, are phenomenal, but a bit pricey. If you're a cheapo like me, they've got premade half sandwiches that run a lot cheaper, but are still pretty bomb.","Such a cute cafe and great study space! There are tons of tables and lots of natural light. However, there are not a lot of outlets so come with your electronics charges! I've only tried the cappuccino so far and it was very good. Everything on their menu looks quality. Definitely a place to check out!","The coffee here is really good and I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't due to my recent experience. I ordered through an app called . I got a large coffee but when I showed up, it was small. I asked the barista three times if that was my drink and he said ""yes"". I left puzzled so I decided to check the app and I DID order a large, not small. I felt bad bringing it back but I went in and showed the barista on the app that I ordered a different size. I apologized because I felt bad bringing it back and asking him to make another. He just looked at my app, made a grunting noise, and starting making another. When he was done I said ""thanks so much"" and he just looked at me like I was an inconvenience. Maybe if they would have read the order the right the first time, it wouldn't have had to be remade. I shouldn't have to sad sorry for my drink being messed up.","This place is so great that we made two visits while we were visiting Chicago.  Our first visit was for brunch bagels and coffee.  The bagels were perfectly toasted, sliced, and topped with our choices of toppings.  They were quickly prepared and totally hit the spot!  My cappuccino was a dream-- not only was it a work of art, but it tasted delightful.  The espresso base was complex and fragrant.  Our second visit was for an afternoon caffeine recharge.  We knew the coffee was a hit, so we ordered an iced coffee and a cappuccino again.  Again, the orders came out quickly and exactly how we had ordered.",I honestly can say that the customer service is awesome and the meals are great.My buddy tried black cat cappuccino and I purchased mocha latte which I find very good. I had a little sip of what he purchased and think it is average.Had a good time! I likely will return.,"This restaurant serves soul food. For it to also be located on the south side, it baffles why soul food is not also listed in the cuisine section. I visited with a friend. There was no hostess stating whether to sit or not, so people come in and look around, guessing what to do. We went to a table until 10 minutes of no server, we went to the bar to order. You wait standing there for your food and drink. I had collard greens (good), fried chicken (it lacked seasoning), and a very hard and cold biscuit. The serving size was literally for a first grader. I find it odd that they want a tip when there is no server. Right after I tipped, I asked Megan what was in the next room which they announced was open. I was waiting for my friend's food at the counter still. She said, ""you'll have to go see for yourself."" That's when I knew I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. We came from the west & south burbs. Had just bought food and tipped (for no reason) and this was the ""service."" Never again. I guess I was suppose to walk around with my food and drink in hand, with no info? This was her time to share with new patrons and create return customers, but no. Better service and food is still had else where. Venue looks nice (star). Music was so loud, I couldn't hear my friend who sat directly next to me. Free parking (star). The south side needs businesses but it needs businesses with good service even more.",,"I love the comfy coffeehouse ambiance, the friendly cute guy behind the counter, that it is in Englewood, and the fact that it is community owned and run! They serve pretty much the gamut of coffee and tea offerings, as well as some unique breakfast items  (baked oatmeal, paninis, house-made granola), fruit smoothies, sandwiches, soups, salads, and baked goods. Sandwiches  haves cutesy/kitschy names like Mozz Def, Tuna Turner, Bernie Mac & Cheese, etc. The Chicken Funkadelic Panini is delish and worthy of an encore! The blueberry muffin was moist, flavorful, and full of love. The chicken noodle soup will be remembered fondly until it is in season again.Kusanya apparently means ""to meet, or gather"" in Swahili, and Kusanya Cafe is providing a place for its patrons to do just that!","I have eaten from the Medici many times!!! This past Saturday I ordered a thin crust family size Garbage pizza and a Himbersaft (sp) lemonade and had it delivered to my house. My delivery guys name was Aurelio. He was warm, nice and professional. All of my children bumrushed the door and he was very warm and not pretentious with my children. KeepAUERELIO!! He is a great addition to your staff! I had a great experience with him!!! The bell pepper on my Garbage Pizza wasn't cooked well enough for me. Maybe if you guys sauté it lightly first then add it to the pizza like 5 mins before it's done. The crust was freaking amazing! I mean stellar!!!!!! My lemonade was delicious too! Of course I will be back!! Tell Aurelio the lady who told him that she was going to Yelp about his Top Notch Service said hi!!!!","Fantastic spot! The spot is beautifully laid out, I love the walk up counter, the crowd is a good mix of students, young professionals, and older crowd. The decor is chic. I had the soy milk latte. They have the Pacific Barista blend which works beautifully, would give it a 3.5/5. The chocolate croissant was fantastic, 3.5/5 and can use some heating before they serve it but the chocolate hazelnut poundcake takes the cake, no pun intended 4.5/5. It is soft, crumbly, nutty, and baked extremely well.",THIS is one of my new favorite spots!  The coffee is good (I drink mine black) and the lox & bagel was really tasty!  The music was mellow and I was able to have a wonderful conversation with my friend.  I will definitely be back.  The atmosphere was BEYOND inviting!
29,"I love the Gallery Cafe.  Its the perfect stop for a quick bite or coffee.  I work across the street, and Gallery Cafe gets me caffeinated and ready to go for the day!  Try their power monkey (its too good!)","I think after many visits that is is my favorite in Chicago. It's cozy, great espresso, great food... you really can't go wrong! The staff is always really friendly and even though it's usually busy when I go there, I can always find a spot to park while I enjoy. Highly recommend.",Superb! The quality of the coffee cannot be matched. I got the cappuccino and it was divine. Excellent espresso. Perfect velvety foam.,"Cool cafe coffee shop in Bucktown. They're open late. It's by the 606 elevated trail. There's a cool mural outside and a bark. It's quite busy and popular. There's a smaller location close by. While the first location is cozy and small with tables and chairs that don't match, this location is more elegant, and I saw couples having cocktails in the evening. I guess it depends on your personality which location you prefer, This one is open late. I think they make their own donuts. The croissants are from Floriole.",First visit today and really liked it! It's really clean and aesthetically pleasing so I'm sure I'll be back to sit and read and relax. I loved the simple lay out and also really into the Blind Date with a Book idea! I didn't have cash so I'll have to come back to buy one (it goes to charity so cash donation for that only).,I adore the quirky feel & nerdy decor of this coffeeshop. There's a variety of seating from chairs to cozy couches. The lighting towards the rear of the shop is quite dim so just a heads up. The wi-fi is reliable & fast. Outlets are kinda sparse depending on where you sit. Coffee is always good. I haven't had a bad experience yet.,"Was in the area looking for a affordable breakfast place and found this gem of a bagel place. Had the bageler (egg, bacon, chipotle mayo, cheese) and it was pretty awesome. 10/10 would visit again.","I've been here twice before. Once approximately two years ago, and other time just this past week.I really enjoy the atmosphere/ambience. The decor reminds me somewhat of 1910s/1920s America, and I think it's a very cute place to study or even have a coffee date. However, the most recent time that I was here, the service was disastrously slow, likely due to a problem with understaffing. One single worker was running the cash register, making the drinks, and bringing the food to the tables. There were about 10-12 people in front of me in line when I arrived, and 15 minutes later, only three of them had been helped. I wouldn't say that I'm an impatient person, but it felt absurd to have to wait that long to put in an order (and with 7 more people to be helped before me, was likely going to take quite a while longer). Needless to say, I ended up leaving because it was just too slow.Last time I was here, it didn't seem to be this way. I remember the line moving quickly, and getting my coffee without any issue. They really should hire some more people.","Cool little brewery that just opened in River East. It's a bit pricey, but hey it's the neighborhood. They have a pretty wide menu of coffees, teas, juices, assorted food and sandwiches, plus they serve wine and cocktails, which I'm never opposed to lol The main positive aspect is that it's a place in the area where you can hang out and chill, since there really aren't a whole lot of places like that in the area so close to the lake/Navy Pier. Several people were there just chilling. Didn't order anything fancy, just a grapefruit juice, but I look forward to returning since I go to the river east theater all the time","Finals week is one hell of a week.. came in here to get my usual iced Chai with soy milk that I get from any coffee/tea joint. Ordering it from Dollop is heaven every sip I take. The chai is so rich and perfect to my taste. I also ordered the Everything Bagel with Cream Cheese, Red Onion, and Tomato.. GOSH. So good! And the staff is so sweet and lovely (+++)So happy that this location is so close to DePaul U, where I spend most of my days. Definitely my go-to as of late.","Good spot to sit down, grab a coffee, and get some work done. The coffee is good, not super fancy but affordable. There's plenty of seating and tons of variety - from armchairs to couches to high, communal tables. The place is always busy with students and working professionals, so expect a wait.",My latte was pretty good. The latte art is always a nice bonus. I wish they had almond milk as a milk substitute.,"My best friend and I were here a few hours ago from the Art Incubator. I should have checked in for a free biscuit. Anyway, I had the catfish PoBoy which was so good, seasoned and not fried hard. I love their fries too! I'm definitely coming back for breakfast!",,"Ok so I live a few blocks from this cafe and every time I pass by I make a note to check it out. Well, I finally made it and it was well worth the wait. The food is fantastic. I got the special: Rasta Jerk Chicken Wrap and it was great. It's got a well-needed kick. I also got a lemonade and some cookies and they hit the spot. The atmosphere is inviting and the service is fantastic. Stop in, grab a sandwich, and chat with the employees. I will definitely be back to some of the community events they host!","The food and service here is good. Nothing amazing, but it's one of the few places in Hyde Park where you can go out to eat with friends. It's usually crowded and doesn't take reservations, which can be annoying. But, the wait usually isn't long in any case. Some comments on the food. The chili cheese fries are very good. The deep dish pizza with sun dried tomato and goat cheese is also tasty (although a bit oily). I'd skip the garbage burger though.","don't come here for a casual hangout with friends because you will not find space, and you will not be able to hear yourself think over the truly horrendous music. That being said, the coffee, pastries, and salad are great despite being overpriced. Check out nearby Sanctuary Cafe for a better ambience and quality",Great coffee shop with a very authentic menu. The non coffee drinks are really refreshing and crisp. if you are looking to do work i highly suggest going here. they have a ton of space and uber friendly folks.
30,"Solid coffee shop if you need to get some work done and want a killer breakfast sandwich. Everyone who works here is sweet, wifi is strong, and overall it's a cozy atmosphere.","In my top three favorite coffee shops in the city! The coffee is top notch. Delicious and consistent. Staff is super friendly. The space is beautiful and awesome for doing work throughout the day. Understandably, it gets very busy on the weekends.","Onsistantly good coffee. Inteligencia is becoming a regional Starbucks, without reducing quality. They're clearly doing the right thing. I had a Bolivian Kalita todsy, good yet not off the charts.","What a nice lil addition to the neighborhood ! Wish they were around when I lived a few blocks away and jogged the 606 a few times a week . Solid lattés and iced coffee's . I usually order whatever specialty coffee a coffee shop has so I tried the nutella latté but it was too sweet for my liking and I can do sweet. They have the cutest lil tiny baby dougnuts I usually get for my daughter and I to share. Best coffee shop on the 606, in my opinion. Grab a cup o Joe before your jog , or come lay down In the hill grassy  area next to it in between or after your jog/walk .","Absolutely love this book cafe. Very cute little book store that also serves you drinks. One of the best spot at wicker park. They also have benches in the book store section that let u sit while u flip through the books, magazines. They also have a section for kids. And even a clean bathroom. How good is that. Why do we not have more book cafes like that ? I am used to growing up in book store as a kid and just wonder how kids these days don't have the opportunity to do that anymore with the technology and internet. Oh by the way, the staff were super nice too! Highly recommend their shop.","This place has 80s character and good drinks to boot. I ordered their seasonal shot in the dark latte, with lavender, mint, and activated charcoal and wow!!! Wasn't sure what to expect, but the flavor combos really work. We loved the 80s decor and broken-in couches- such a great place to hang out and play some cartridge video games (Mario, TMNT, blades of steel, link), grab a spot at a table to work, or sit at their coffee bar close to the barista action.","Imagine a warm, quaint little cafe space, with the best bagel and drink options your little heart can desire. That's Bageler's. I love trying their creative drinks (they have SO many - and they are all delicious). My favorite is the Apple Chaider - half chai and half warm apple cider. YUM. They have many cream cheese options and different bagel options as well (highly recommend Strawberry cream cheese on any bagel!). The staff is friendly and no matter how crowded it is, they are fairly quick with getting the food/drinks made. It's a smaller place, but can fill up quickly, so bring your laptop and if you're lucky, you can snag a table to get some work done. I love this little laid back neighborhood spot!","Very cozy. Great service.  Delicious food. You can't go wrong. I live their coffee, cookies, and sandwiches.","Cupitol is one of the few coffee shops where I can sit for hours and get work done. They have good coffee - I especially like the Nutella latte - but the food is really where Cupitol shines. They have a lot of options for a coffee shop, and the portions are huge - you get a lot for your money. Some of my favorites are the Spanish omelet and the sweet potato curry bowl. All their breakfast sandwiches are delicious as well, and their hash browns are to die for. They have tons of seating, the lighting is fantastic, and the music is good without being too loud. The only negative is that there aren't enough outlets, so you have to get there early to grab a spot near an outlet if you need power.",Idk the coffee is mediocre and the pastries are ugh...I got excited to see a scone and it was the worst Chocolate chip scone ever...Coffee was just okay..I regretted not going to McDonald's for iced coffee...would've been almost $1 cheaper and a bigger cup...,"Only come here for the bagels, because the coffee is not as tasty as what I am used to. Still not bad lattes though. Their coffee is locally sourced. I am more of an adventurer Kind of guy so I love trying new places. They do stack up on the cream cheese, so all the time we have to scrape half of it off. No biggie just a bit messy. It's locally close by us so that's a plus. They also do a neighborhood discount with proof of your high rise fob.","A couple of coworkers brought me by Intelligentsia recently and I really enjoyed myself. The highest marks belong to the ambiance and just overall style and class of the venue. Otherwise, I have never really been a fan of the coffee at Intelligentsia, it just has some weird, put-off kind of taste to me; hard to explain.Otherwise, I would come back in hopes to find a tea I could enjoy in the cool, modern space that is Inteliigentsia. A definite plus is that the staff members are really nice and helpful.","First time here and definitely will be back.  Only had time to grab a cup of (bottomless) coffee but the vibe, prices and selections were all top notch.  Conveniently located across the street from green line Garfield stop, CE is a cool place to work, write, chat, etc.  The place has DJs and live jazz once a month as well.  The only thing that it needs to change are the hours -- 8am to 4pm?! -- You're losing a ton of $$$ not being open for those that commute to work via the green line.  Definitely want to try the food next time.",,"A wonderful place.  Friendly people, great service, yummy yogurt parfait, excellent tea & coffee...and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to boot!","Quoting my niece ""Worst pizza ever!"" Resident of Kenwood area for 18 years and have visited Medici over the years. The quality of the pizza has gone down. I thought I would give it another chance. I gambled and lost. Undercooked. Asked to have it sent back and it was returned burnt at the top and still undercooked at the bottom. How does a place mess up a simple pepperoni pizza?!?!  Why would you serve a burnt pizza?!?! Never again. Plenty of other restaurants who take pride in their food, their service, and know how to properly cook/make a pizza.","I feel smarter just being there. Hot fresh beignets and great coffee all together in Chicago, are you kidding me? Too bad the valet parking is always full.  Enjoy!","TLDR:- 2 stars off for sub par coffee.- 1 star off for pretentious barista.- 2 stars for being a local business and pricing. Long story:I was driving by this place just after 7am and I wanted a cup of coffee so I tried looking inside and I didn't see anyone, and there was no open sign, so I parked and went in anyways. It was open. So I ordered a large Mocha with an extra shot because their large mochas only come with 2 shots apparently. So I told the barista ""hey you guys should think about getting an open sign, as I just saw someone else drive by slowly looking inside to see if you were open."" Barista replies, ""No I don't think so. Our regular customers know when we are open."" I respond ""it was just a suggestion""Thanks for the pretentiousness, but if you want to run a business then you should make new customers feel welcome. This isn't a social club. If I had gone to Starbucks instead at 7am you would know it was open because there would be so many people.Finally I get the coffee and it tastes like chocolate milk. Even though it's cheaper than Starbucks you have to add enough espresso shots to make it more than Starbucks. Maybe he didn't put my extra shot, or any espresso at all. There was no other people there so that's not an excuse. Maybe business is booming other times, but it wasn't looking so good when I went. I guess the Starbucks at the hospital I work at will do."
31,"Good drinks, very expensive. Paid $15 for a small wrap ( which was advertised to come with chips and did not) and a double cappuccino. The wrap was good but not anything to rave about",This place is spacious.Street parking. Pay to park or there's a free parking on Fullerton. Got the vanilla latte. Delicious. Not too pricey. Not loud. There's a lot of outlets. A lot of tables to sit. No outlet around the high seats though. Workers are nice. Very welcoming with their greeting!,Great coffee. My bf had a conference call during our trip so we stopped by this place mainly for the internet. I got the latte (latte leaf art hehe) and I think it was an almond croissant. Both were delicious and hit the spot on the rainy day. (what a crazy weekend of weather that labor day weekend.... it was blazing hot and humid and then it was storming and raining. geez)workers were friendly bathroom was clean shop was decorated in a hipster fresh way conveniently across the street from the train station,Ordered a mocha from here. It was very creamy and delicious. One of the best mochas I've tasted! The atmosphere is great for working or even just socializing with friends.,"I love volumes! This place is a book store with a cafe! I love a few doors down and this place is def my stop after work to get my ""I made it through another day of work latte."" They have a rewards program applies to all purchase books/cafe etc. $1=$1 point after you spend $100 you get 10 back. It's the best when I get that $10 reward it's like 3 or 4 ice coffees. I don't generally buy books I'm not as avid of a reader as I would like to be. I have gotten some nice jigsaw puzzles from them, as well as, adult coloring books and good little gifts for the avid reader in your life. The staff is very friendly and a knowledgeable for book recommendations. I really love this place great spot to check out in wicker park.","I had to go to wicker park for a event and was looking for a place to meet friends in the neighborhood.While browsing places on yelp came across this place with pretty good reviews and especially reviews from Sarah and Alex compelled me to try this place.The decor is unique and pretty youthful with Old unused car on the attic ,Macintosh and Old telephone which gives pretty good vibe.Service was pretty good and quick.I tried the honey bear latte and it was good and friends had cold lattes and they loved it.Cons:Free WifiUnique AmbiencePatioReasonable pricesUnique TasteCheck this place and you will like it","The east coast elitism in me can't love this place because of their "" schmear"" options. Ready:Nutella is not cream cheesePeanut butter is not cream cheese Jam is not cream cheeseThis seems easy enough, but this place had many ""schmear"" options, but few cream cheese choices. It isn't worth leaving the house and paying money to have someone give you a scoop of nutella on bread. The bagels themselves were fine; a step above the grocery store's bakery and a step below new York Bagel Deli. However unless you are after a locally made cup of coffee or one of their bagel sandwiches, I would save your carb lust for real, cream-cheese-filled satisfaction.",They should disclose somewhere that their kitchen opens at 8 am . I arrived around opening time which is 7 am and wasn't able to grab a bite before work. Slightly disappointed considering I used my only hour to drive to this place when I could've went elsewhere .,"Really lovely atmosphere: open, spacious, tons of light and plenty of tables. I had a small latte- well made and not super milky. Husband got the Nutella latte, which we thought was just ok. We both had croissants and thought they were delicious and flaky. We'd definitely come back!Pick your table before ordering your food cuz you'll have to give your table number.","I really wanted to like this place. Bright and cheery and in a good location. But if you charge more than Starbucks, your coffee has to be better than Starbucks. Not the case here. And to top it off, my muffin was not fresh - needed the watery coffee to wash it down. Too bad.",Great spot for pour over and mexican mocha. Friendly and informative conversation with Sam. Got some info on what to check out as a clueless tourist from NYC. Cheers. Keep killin it dudettes. :),"Intelligentsia is a really nice cosy place in loop. Highly professional staff and great coffee quality. I ordered the almond cappuccino made from Kunga Maitu, Kenya beans. It has the typical berry/black current flavor of Kenya beans. Overall profile is very well balanced and smooth. It smells woody and nutty with a consistent beauty-berry-sour taste. The finish is bitter and neat.Enjoyed the visit. Will try out the New York location too. Congrats intelligentsia on making the 20 year anniversary! May the goodness continue for another 20 years!","I conduct many business meetings here and I just love the vibe.  The food is great, the music is straight from my playlists and the people are cool.  Parking is not too bad if you arrive early enough, but it's manageable.",,"There is no Cafe that has done more for their community than Kusanya. Everything they do is above and beyond par, and done with love. A gem of an establishment. Well worth the trip. Go check them out, you'll be glad you did.","An amazing menu and even more amazing food! The hummus was delicious and came with very fresh veggies and warm pita. I strongly recommend giving it a try.  My chicken salad croissant was the perfect blend of flavors and made fresh. The staff was very polite and attentive, my water glass was never empty! This is a place I would love to frequent.","Beautiful cafe with a great relaxed/serene atmosphere located on the University of Chicago campus. Delicious drinks and the food looks great as well. Menu looks quite diverse for a cafe.  Love the fact they provide free still, sparking, or cold water fresh out of a tap that's easily accessible to customers.The hot chocolate was delicious - not overly heavy nor did it taste like pure milk. Just perfect. Chai latte was also great. Would order both of those again. Wifi is free for non-UChicago students, though took awhile to connect to it. Ask the barista for the password. Great place to grab a drink before heading to the library or even to stay and to study.",I'm not sure what the hype is about.  I got their latte and it tastes like coffee flavored milk.
32,"Come for the breakfast sandwiches, they are fresh and have some of the fluffiest, most delicious eggs I've ever purchased. Consistently great breakfast sandwiches, with healthy options and whole grain bread on the menu.The selection of pastries and random assorted garbage is lacking, which is fine by me. Decent cold beverage selection. Ambiance not quite as cozy or comfortable as some coffee shops. They recently added a bit more art to conform to their name. Overall, this is a go to spot for me and just close enough that I go out of the way to get to it.","Friendly vibe. terrible coffee. I ordered a croissant and a macchiato, cost 8$ and five minutes of time. croissant was rock hard and had no taste. espresso was by far most disappointing. the barista seemed as if they knew what they were doing. my mistake was trusting their judgement.  the espresso was acidic and sour. wouldn't waste my time again.","I love intelligentsia. I'm sure it was just this particular barista, but my coffee was not hot, warm as best.","This is my favorite cafe in Chicago. I've been here a few times now (in fact, I make sure to drop by and spend some time here whenever I'm in the Wicker Park area). I love their laid back yet professional service and the upscale interior. But most of all, I love their creative coffee offerings. The Ipsento Latte, their signature drink, is just unique. I'm sipping it as I write this, and the hot, spicy flavor perfectly complements the rich latte. Oh, for those of you who don't know, the secret is cayenne pepper (just a little bit). They also offer seasonal items like pumpkin latte that's literally real (made with real pumpkin stuff). Best class cafe all around, cheers.","Independent all the way!Stopped in on a Wednesday night to this great neighborhood bookstore. Coffee, tea, wine, free WiFi, books...I mean fabulous well-curated books (including a section of cool banned books), and lots of events/happenings.What I really love about Volumes is the kids book section with a kid-friendly reading area. From little kids to middle school to teens, it's one of the best collections I've seen in a seemingly non-kid part of town geared towards hipsters.Here's a rundown of the events they regularly host:- Trivia night every Monday- Storytime for kids every Wed/Sat Morning 10am- Open mic night every 1st Wednesday- All lady comedy showcase every last Wednesday night (I was there during this night)- Book club meet ups every monthCafe tables, bench seating, and comfy area for kiddos. Great lighting, great vibe, in a really beautiful storefront. Can't get enough bookstores in my life, so I wish this place the best. Cool!","Throwback Thursday Phoenix begins on a Chicago Wednesday with a song called Blue Monday....I am a believer! Believer!! Capital B. This wormhole works. It's about time I fire off these five stars given that I drank up another Peanut Butter Koopa Troopa (PBKT) yesterday, snapped a never-before-done photo (by me) with the ""My other car is a Delorean"" bumper sticker,"" flew out to Phoenix last night and today...driving along I-17 north and what am I coming up on...a Delorean!? THE Delorean.  ""OUTATIME""  Total replica, only 30-some in the world. Not only that, dude exited same ramp as did I so we ended up in a Walgreen's parking lot - having a chat. He loved it that I showed him my photo of the Wormhole Coffee.  So back to the future...long have I loved this house of coffee, from when I first set eyes on the Delorean (among other retro stuff, especially the Mac) and when I first set lips on this PBKT - a peanut butter mousse, dark chocolate latte. Yeah.  So, indeed no, I have not had any other drink here - not even my regular black coffee.  How can I drink anything else when the PBKT is like drinking a decadent, rich peanut butter and chocolate souffle.  I liken it to a souffle because it's just so perfectly airy and rich. Creamy and delicious, not at all overly-sweetened. And I'm not a latte or ""fru fru"" coffee drink person whatsoever.  I don't even mind that - when I'm sitting on that comfy couch - that I figure out how old I am. It clicks that I'm listening to remakes of what I listened to in college. By the way, nice job, ""Orgy"" on not screwing up ""Blue Monday."" And then, I remind myself that I like the '90s and beyond music too so I'm  not that old after all. Phew. You're young. You're thin! Get a pastry. They have donuts, assorted cookies and a chocolate candy bar maybe even...and one time, I know I got myself a macaron here.  I did!....  (December 2014 but I'd wager they still have 'em)If you need a sugar fix, a caffeine jolt, a PBKT kiss, a blast from the '80s past or a trip back to the future...this place has you covered. Hey, all that and bumper stickers too. I swear it's how wound up standing behind the bumper of the Delorean this fine afternoon.","I'm a royal customer to ""The Bagelers"" satellite kiosk at the Jefferson Park Blue Line station since I commute to/from Rosemont for work.  I was browsing through deals on Groupon and spotted the Groupon for The Bagelers' main location in Lincoln Park.  Oh man, I love this place!  Can I purchase more of those Groupons?  I think I know the menu quite well at this point.  Here are my recommendations: 1) The Bagelers' Brew: it's similar to a coffee slushie, and I believe there's a shot of espresso in it.  It's probably one of my favorites at The Bagelers and is available limited time only.  2) Sesame seed bagel + honey nut spread: I have had a number of bagel/spread combos, but this combination is the most memorable ones for me.  I'm a fan of their honey nut spread.  3) Everything bagel + giardiniera spread: it screams ""garlicky, garlicky and GARLICKY!""  Make sure order a large iced coffee to wash down that smell in the mouth.  The decors are clean and simple, featuring art pieces for sale.  The dining room is equipped with nice, comfy sofa seating.  It's located in the chic, urban, and walking-friendly Lincoln Park neighborhood, so there are many trendy restaurants and boutiques to poke around if you've got time.",Visited during a weekend lunch hour. Nice outdoor seating and the service is friendly. The food is really good. I noticed a lot of people ordering the iced coffees. I love the atmosphere here. The sandwiches we ordered were hot and fresh and really yummy! They have a lot of cool different flavors.,"Wanted to meet up with a couple of gal pals where we weren't sure of our timeline that evening so Cupitol popped up in my search as an all day lounge. Sounded great to me, as it was definitely going to be a chill atmosphere and we can could hang for as little or as long as we wanted, evening potentially having dinner there. I really enjoyed their menus. They really have it all from brunch to dinner and coffee/tea to smoothies to alcoholic beverages, not to mention their delectable selection of pastries. While they had various options, it wasn't too overwhelming and I appreciated their focused menus, as they had a distinct identity.Their space was lovely...very open with various seating options. We opted for the comfy sofa area in the middle. It was a Wednesday evening and it was comfortably busy. Many customers were working on their laptops while others, much like us, were chit chatting our night away.We ended up staying for dinner and sharing the chips & guacamole and a side of mac & cheese. I also got the tuna nicoise salad and one of their Greek beers. Portions were much bigger than I thought especially for a café and especially for the area, so this made me really happy. All the food was solid. Not knock my socks off amazing but quite satisfying, especially for a café where you usually get just a sandwich at most - not to discount sandwiches but Cupitol seemed to value all their options, not trust traditional café items. Food was overall good and fresh.My friend got their refreshing cucumber drink. She waited a long time for this (20 minutes) and when she went up about to inquire, the guy that took her order seemed to rush in the back, so it seemed like a honest mishap in which he forgot. It came out shortly after and my friend really enjoyed it. When placing our orders, service was good. Staff also regularly came by to clear our table.Will definitely keep Cupitol in mind, and would not mind at all coming back for dinner, but would come here any time of the day. I really enjoyed the all day lounge concept.",Holy crap the almond croissant. That is all.,"If you want your stuff stolen, Dollop is the place for you. I used the credit card that was stolen about an hour before (inside Dollop), and realized the theft happened while still in this establishment. To save you readers from judgement, I'm very careful and cognoscente about my belongings, but that was no match for this level of white-collar crime. To add insult to injury, the manager was very unhelpful and immediately informed me that the security cameras do not work. So, I'm assuming they're in on it, probably to make up for their low hourly wages.","Why does this place exist is my question. The prices are outrageous.The staff is very rude. This place really could use diversity training.In my opinion, any coffee shop beats this place.  What does it cost to have some customer service and a smile? They remodeled the store but not the attitudes of the staff. Re do everything not just one thing.","I come here a good amount and it's obviously a great addition to the neighborhood. The food is usually fine, though it tends towards minimalism - the breakfast bowl, for instance, should probably have more than just one tiny egg in it.But the three stars are really for the dismal coffee, which is a recurring theme. The iced coffee, at least, really just tastes like water that has gone off. For the first time in my entire life I returned one the other day, and the lady working the coffee bar did not seem at alllll surprised by my revelation. The fact that it comes in a tiny, probably 8 once glass doesn't really help matters. So in sum, fix the coffee problem or switch providers and everything will be awesome",,One of my favorite spots in all of Englewood! Great coffee and even greater mission.  Go and check them out!,I had the literal worst chai latte of my entire life here last night. It was $4 and TERRIBLE. Don't know why they think it's ok to serve such a bad drink. It was completely flavorless. It always upsets me when a place with a lot of business and experience is majorly lacking in areas-- especially when it's listed prominently on the menu! True North next store has way better drinks. Been coming here my whole life and feel like it has gone downhill over the years. The sandwiches are great but everything else is sub par. It used to be my fav pizza ever but it's not what it used to be,Nice ambience. Food is pricey but tasty. Only complaint is it's kind of small and the tables are close together so it feels sometimes like you are sharing a table with total strangers.,The food was good. But for $36 the portions were so small and not worth the price paid. The food was hot and made correctly. The best part of the meal was the over sized lemonade but this is not an experience I would pay for again.
33,"Go there for the sandwiches. I've only had the drip coffee which is fine, does the job. The breakfast sandwiches though. Fantastic. Fresh eggs, delicious bacon, on whatever bread you want. The focaccia was fresh and was great with the Davinci sandwich.Another pro, it's not a cluster like so many other places in the neighborhood. If you're not looking for the full wicker park brunch experience and just want a good old fashioned cafe experience, then this is it for you.",Disappointed that they don't serve pour overs anymore.  The drip coffee was pretty good and I enjoyed the breakfast sandwich.,"Really friendly, and smaller than I'd have thought, given their fame. When I walked in every employee working that day greeted me and asked how I was. My coffee was ready in moments. Yes, the small latte is small, but really that just means they use less milk. The coffee taste was more robust than, say, the latte I got the day before from dark matter. I don't do a $4 coffee every day, but this is as good as any. Oh, I don't think they had any fun lattes (like, say, Ipsento), it's more of a coffee purist place.Oh, and they have a discount for cyclists, which I love. Although only sometimes apparently, because I biked back a few days later and no discount.","Nitro was really flat, but the decor is nice. (2star) *update: got a good tasty corridor. I forgot who you are but you are the mannn(4 stars)","I am not one to write bad reviews. I generally give people the benefit of a ""bad day"" or what have you, but this was a little much. The service was great, the shop was great, and I was very excited to read the book and write in the journal I purchased, until I opened the book. There are (what I can only assume to be) blood stains on the pages. I don't mind fingerprint smudges, I get people pick up and put down a book endlessly. This was not okay though. Everything is still 100% legible and the stains are minimal, but there are multiple pages with the corners of edges with red or brown streaks and smudges.","Think a 80s and 90s throwback vintage coffee shop with a great menu and latte art, but high prices and slightly disappointing coffee drinks. This coffee shop in Wicker Park has been on my bucket list for quite some time now, and I am sad to say that it didn't quite measure up to my expectations.First off, my mocha drink was barely warm when I got it to drink at the shop. The latte art was fantastic, but I could barely taste the coffee or chocolate flavor. It just felt like a mediocre coffee drink from quick vendor, and not necessarily a dedicated coffee shop. Parking is hard to come by, but possible. Paid metered parking on Milwaukee Ave, and free street parking in the residential area behind the coffee shop.",17 Jun 2018Bageler's Coffee HouseVery nice breakfast/lunch sandwich place. All three of our sandwiches were well balanced. I had a butcher special which was very nice and balanced. My wife had a very buttery almond croissant. My daughter had a bagel with cream cheese and lox (smoked salmon).The only down side was that the AC was broken or not sufficient. They had fans blowing the hot air around (90F plus degrees weekend).,"I really tried to like this place. The decor and location are awesome and the theme with sandwiches named after books is cute but I just can't do it. The owner is notorious for treating his employees terribly causing high turnover and it shows in the poor quality of service. The last two times I got dishes with eggs in them, they had a ridiculous amount of shell in them. They charge like 3 or 4 dollars for hot chocolate that is literally just powder mix with hot milk. They are always out of various ingredients and products and the final time I went in there, the bathroom door was broken. I believe in supporting local business, but not when it means workers suffering (and crap service tbh).","Location Location Location! My husband and I are so happy to have this new addition to Streeterbille. Secondly we adore the chill vive that this coffee shop has. The moment you go up the stairs and into the place, the music is on point and the beautiful Chic Modern Industrial decor is very nice. We love to sit by the large windows and enjoy the luxurious chairs and the seating arrangement. The only thing that is missing is a FIREPLACE (come on we are in the Midwest). The reason I am giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because they went so far to create a great atmosphere, but they fell short by not creating that warm toasty feel with a fireplace. With the huge windows, lots of cool air comes thru and we have to keep our coats on in order to enjoy that area. Im glad they decided to tie in the decor and keep the history of this building alive with a twist of modern Chic. This building was conste back in 1905 thru 1920 and it used to be an industrial warehouse. We have not tried their food yet, but we did try the chocolate almond croissant  And it was DELICIOUS, the plain bagel was a bit small but it was nice. The lattes were also very good and the art work was on point. We enjoyed the atmosphere so much that we stayed longer than we had planned. So we ordered another round of lattes and this time we each tried something different. I ordered the NUTELLA LATTE which was very tasty, I actually enjoyed it a lot. My husband had the MOCA LATTE and he was very happy with it. Overall it was a pleasant experience and we enjoyed the friendly service from the cashier, to the lady that picked up our plates she was super SWEET and very polite.","I gave this place two chances to satisfy me and is has failed on both ocassions. I asked for a large mocha and they pretty much gave me a regular latte. They also messed up my sandwich order of a BLT, which is a pretty basic sandwhich to make. If you want to come to a place for a cute Instagram pic and waste your money on some inadequate and overly expensive food and drinks, this is the place for you. Otherwise, don't bother.",BEST spot for coffee...the Honey Cinnamon Late is excellent and the dirty chai latte is made to perfection. This casual coffee shop has high ceilings and a nice industrial looking. Their personnel are friendly and attentive. Try it you won't regret it.,"Affordable High Quality.  Love and Loyal to Intelligentsia since Lakeview and Day 1 of this location.MENU -- I love options!  Sophisticated than ever.  Quality beans.  Generous standardized Art Latte.  MACCHIATO automatically came with lightly fizzy water.  The ANGELENO with 4 shots of espresso for $5.5 is an excellent value.  You can have 2.5 shots for half the price.  How hard does your heart palpitate?  *wink*VENUE -- plenty of comfortable seating that easily gets crowded.  2 unisex bathrooms.  Due to limited space, this cafe is not meant for hours-and-hours of lounging.","Don't be fooled...Great place, good food, nice location and very discreet. This is my third time here, I order something different every time.  The tacos are good, the soul food breakfast bowl is great, and the Cobb salad with chicken, which I ate today, is phenomenal. Oh the biscuit just makes the whole ordeal outstanding.",,"I am so glad I finally made it to this place! I tried a few different things: the chicken funkadelic sandwich, a lemonade and a peanut butter cookie. All were flavorful and incredibly affordable. I even got a bag of ground Kusanya coffee to go! On top of all that, the staff was friendly and welcoming. I'm proud to have a place like this in my community. You should definitely check it out if you can.","Baby Friendly: 5 starsKid Friendly: 5 starsWe eat here all the time (sometimes in the restaurant, sometimes at the Bakery, sometimes take out).  We have tried most of the menu, and have come from brunch on the weekends early in the morning and later on, as well as weekday lunch, and weekday and weekend dinners.  It's busiest for brunch or lunch!  But they're always friendly and helpful.We love sitting on the patio upstairs.  It's really pretty!  We'll also sit on the patio in front of the bakery, because we can pull the stroller right up to the table easily.This place is very kid friendly. They have high chairs.  They let us bring our stroller upstairs to put on the patio with us, and also offered to let us keep it downstairs. This is super helpful. They were friendly to the baby. There were other tables with young children, and they all seemed happy and well treated.  There is a kids menu, and the kids we've come with enjoyed the kids food.  The handicap bathroom is big, has a sink and a koala care changing table in it. So either parent could change the baby's diaper! My favorite items are their breakfast foods, sandwiches, salads, and any baked goods.  My frequent orders:Lemonade or strawberry or raspberry lemonade.  I love lemonade, and theirs is my favorite lemonade from anywhere.  It's frozen, so it's slushy like.  It's the perfect lemonade in every way.Veggie omelet.  This is a great omelet, and it's packed full of veggies.  The potatoes that come with it are great.  I always get cinnamon raisin toast, it's fantastic.  Sometimes I get a side of chicken sausages, they're great too.Moroccan Ragout.  This is kind of like a spicy lentil chili.  It's delicious, and very likely vegan.  It comes with pita bread and cucumber yogurt sauce.  It's not very big, but it's very tasty!House salad with balsamic pesto vinaigrette.  This is the best salad dressing in the world.  The house salad is fairly plain, but it's big and I love that dressing!  I frequently get this and the Moroccan Ragout.Grilled cajun pita.  This is a wrap on a pita.  The grilled chicken is great.  The cucumber yogurt is great.  What's not to like?  It comes with fries.Grilled chicken skewers.  The skewers and rice are very tasty.  There's not a lot of food, but it's all good.Cajun Turkey sandwich.  The Medici bakes their own bread, and they make amazing bread.  That's what makes all of their sandwiches so good.  This is my favorite of their sandwiches.Croissants.  They're all amazing.  My favorites are the chocolate and almond ones.  My coworkers love the ham & cheese.Apple pie.  It's amazing.Cinnamon raisin bread loafThings I don't like from Medici:Pizza, BBQ Chicken, fettuccine alfredo, fries (to be fair the fries aren't bad.  They're just plain, and not interesting.  They're kinda like Burger King Fries.  Whereas I like McDonald's fries).",This is the pretty spot in hyde park. I usually go to their for breakfast. I love the royal pie spinach and the blue berry french toast. I usually order the blueberry danish ( absolutely delicious) For the coffee it's very strong for me.  (personal) So I didn't order every time. About theirs decoration I really really love it. It is the cutest place in Hyde park. So we can drink Coffee and eat in the cutes place. Love it !!,Great little community coffee shop. Love the vibes and the friendly staff. Excited this is walking distance from home! :)
34,"The location was good, since there was really no other alternatives around. I was happy they had different choices of milks (including almond and coconut.) the only bummer was that they had a delicious sounding coffee shake on the menu, but they couldn't make it because they were out of bananas. Suggest taking it off the board if you can't make it, so we are disappointed ;). Also love that you have RX bars, maybe add a few more flavors ;)","My favorite neighborhood cafe - lot's of seating, great light, excellent coffee, and friendly staff.  Good place to get work done if you can get a table.Coffee: Roasted in-house, the beans are nicely packaged in plain brown paper bags with different colored wax seals.  Their cold-brew is excellent, as is their espresso and drip coffee.  Their espresso actually comes with a little cup of sparkling water which is a nice, refreshing afternoon option.  Watch out if you order hot coffee in a for-here cup, though, as their cups do tend to cool the coffee down pretty fast (or maybe I'm just a slow drinker).  So, if you don't wanna gulp of lukewarm coffee, drink up!Ambiance: the cafe is really bright and spacious, with plenty of tables (though they fill up fast).  It has kind of a woodsy, eclectic look to it - with taxidermy and antiques and interesting wallpaper.  The music can be a little hit or miss - sometimes it's a bit loud and grating.  One thing to note, if you sit by one of the window seats in the middle of the day when the sun is shining through you might end up sweating as I think it's a single pane - this even happened to me in the winter, the sun can get really hot in there. Food: I've never tried their pastries (there usually weren't a lot of options) but they have a really nice menu that they serve out of their kitchen.  It can be a little on the pricey side, but it puts other coffee shop food to shame, particularly the avocado toast and the grilled cheese. Staff: super friendly - I was in here at least 3-4 times a week for over a year and never had any issues.  Overall, a great spot in a really nice part of the neighborhood.",Best Espresso I've ever had. I always make a point to get a cup when I'm in town. The staff at this particular location are very friendly as well!,"Wonderful espresso, and great whole bean offerings. It gets busy on the weekends, so if you're hoping to sit and work, get there early!The evening laptop rule is enforced, and is meant to encourage community among patrons. We enjoyed talking with other customers, and had a great experience! :)","this place has quickly become my new favorite book store in Chicago! Great selections at super cheap prices! They have some used and overstock books super cheap in great condition and the newer works are well selected and reasonably priced. Cute cafe attached with yummy drinks and down to earth attitude. As an avid reader and literary nerd, I am quickly becoming a regular.","We loved the selection of lattes, but we weren't impressed with our orders. The vanilla latte had vanilla bean flecks in bottom of the cup (which is amazing in theory), but we honestly couldn't taste it. The cool but rude latte (with curry paste and ginger), was extremely sweet, though I loved the spices. The decor is quite a scene. I might bring friends in just to see the interesting wall art and back to the future car installation. Not much seating.","I'm kind of shocked by the high reviews and popularity of this place.  We went in at 8:30 on a Sunday and it was already filling up.  Right away we were bummed to discover they didn't have high chairs, which just seems silly in a family friendly area like this.  We ended up using our own that attaches to the table, but the tables are SUPER flimsy and were afraid our 1 year old was going to tip the darn thing over all meal!All would be forgivable if the bagels were amazing, but they were SO chewy and doughy.  Barely toasted and just plain gummy.  Plus the every seed bagel had about a grand total of 1 of each seed.  Very disappointing.  I'm adding one star based soley on the cream cheese, which was actually awesome.  The garlic chive was phenomenal, and my husband really liked the giardiniera one.  But I'm sorry, if the bagels aren't good, I won't be back.","The pig could be criticized for being small. But it is precisely, in part, because it is small that it is so wonderful.The pig (I don't know if anyone calls it this besides me) is intimate. There is a sign out front with a pig. Black iron. There is table seating outside. Small. Closed in a black iron fence two feet high. The sidewalk is other side of the gate. The street leads down to leaves and beautiful houses. Eventually the lake. You can go inside where there will be pastries and it will smell like coffee and you will hear the hiss and pump of the machines. You will see into the back ""kitchen"" which is...like...a-hallway-of-light and no more there's-the-back-door small--like 10 feet by 6 feet--it's the yellow light that matters. Students study here by the window, if one can nab a spot. This place is not corporate. Not a chain. It is brown and yellow with small tables and pinks and old wooden stairs and small bannisters and railings. Glass jars, chalkboard, low round tables, wood would stop bullets.They serve food next door during the day, same old building/house/structure the ""pig,"" that is to say, the coffee pig, is in.If you are in the area and you are buying coffee somewhere else (including the real bourgeois place up on Broadway), I'd say you're making a mistake.","Delicious and relaxing lattes. Atmosphere was cheerful and light, I requested to turn down the ac and they quickly responded to make it more comfortable for us. I wish they had a fireplace, would make this place even more inviting. The almond chocolate croissant was yummy and very flaky with the right amount of chocolate. Definitely recommend this place for a nice cup of coffee, lunch or just to unwind for a break you can thank me later.",I like this place. Always vibrant and alive. Coffee is good and they do have small selection of food menue.,"I love dollop but be warned that this location is super slow in the mornings. They only have two people working and they do all orders, coffee and food. I probably spent longer getting a latte here than my taking a my bus from union station. Definitely a lot slower than other locations. Good place to do work though hence the three stars.","Unknown to me, I walked in one minute before the registers closed down for the night.  Whoops.  I was in Chicago for a conference and stopped here because it was on my list of coffee places to visit.  When I got to the register the barista said there was one minute left before it would close.  I really wanted a coffee and they looked as if they were just finishing cleaning up their equipment.  The manager saved the day by offering me a free drip coffee, which was brewed only 20 minutes prior, and we were all happy :)","This spot has easily become one of my favorite cafes. It is located right off the Garfield Green Line stop. I highly recommend the greens. Off the bat, the staff were super welcoming and they did not disappoint when handling the aux chord. Missy, Pharrell, Brandy, Erykah, and Jill filled the space. Worth checking out!!!",,Great food and atmosphere. Clean restaurant upbeat employees. Parking available. Live/ radio music.,"Long time I've eaten food from Medici but never ordered on my own. It's great! The food is not why the rating is low. The service was. I ordered over the phone a Napoli sub-very delicious, fresh- is listed online as served with my choice of several sides, with fries being the default. I was not given fries with my sub. I go back and am told ""only if you ask"". Okay, cool, I'm asking now, while I'm still in the store. Fries are 1.29 as a side with the sandwich, yet 2.99, over 3$ as an individual side. I was told they would ""have to"" charge me the full 3$, even though I just bought a sub and the appropriate measure is to just do a price adjustment. And the team members i spoke with seemed to not care that i was clearly dissatisfied with my experience, and were very dismissive, telling me to ""move"" so other customers could order since i ""wasn't willing to pay"" for the fries. Ridiculous, seeing as i would not have asked for the fries if i didn't want to pay for them. I left upset and ate my delicious sub but that experience alone-first impressions are important- leaves me unwilling to ever spend money there again. TLDR; great food, rude staff","I love plein air. Food and coffee are delicious, the service at the counter can be excellent. Except when it's weird, which is not rare. For just one example, recently I was told that the coffee i ordered ""for here"" couldn't be served in a coffee mug because it would crack the cup because it's too hot.... In all my years of both being a passive aggressive barista myself (so no judgement) and dealing with them, that's a new one on me: a coffee cup that's too hot for coffee.... k..... Also getting tired of increasingly paltry sides of room temperature home fries. Plein Air used to be better about this. Sad because they're so so good when they're good.","This is probably my favorite place to eat in the area for a quick fix up and decent coffee. A bit pricey, but their sandwiches are awesome. Especially their grilled cheese and bacon. Perfect if you're in the area and need a quick bite. Would give a 5, but the prices are to steep."
35,This place has a great vibe....owner was extremely cordial and went above and beyond with customer service! Give it a try and you will take home more than a cup of coffee. Great experience!,Coffee shops in a city as large as Chicago and in a neighborhood as trendy as Logan Square are common. So is the coffee. This place was common and cold.I have never had a cup of coffee so fantastic it   made me want to be a loyal patron of an establishment... and I still haven't. It is normally the ambiance and/or the customer service that brings me back and all I can say is I will not be going back to this place. The only thing I feel this place had going for it was the decor (rustic). The customer service was absent. Maybe it takes Sundays off.You'll get the same cup of coffee and hipster feel from another bourgeois shop in the neighborhood.,"I needed a coffee for work and saw this place around the corner. The walls were lined with expressionless people staring at whatever screen was in their hands. ""I'll have a large coffee and one pastry please."" $10 for a coffee and pastry.For half the price you can go across the street and get fresh made from a local bakery (shout out to Sweet Cakes)Why would anyone pay that much for anything. May be to match the inflation of rent in the neighborhood?It comes with a pat on the back and a side of knowing you are better than everyone else that can't afford to drink here.Perhaps I am an ignorant goon that doesn't get it. What am I missing? Skip this place. Shop mom an pop.","Great coffee, unique coffee cocktails. I tried their take on an Irish Coffee; I'm not usually one for the sweeter drinks but it just seemed like the right choice (it was cold and rainy outside - who wouldn't want an Irish coffee in that context?!).  It was incredibly rich, so definitely something I'd recommend if you want *just* one drink, or plan on switching to something lighter after, BUT really good.  I'll have to make my way back over there to try their other stuff.Overall, a really chill, accessible, friendly place to grab a coffee or drink and do whatever the heart desires.","Almost there at least once a week, this is my go-to cafe whenever I need a place to sit down and write. The coffee is great and is decently priced compared to coffee shops in wicker park which are more often than not over-priced. It's clean and casual atmosphere always manage to put me in my creative-zone and help me focus even though they have regular author events happening in the evening, and half of the space will be taken up for the events.I also enjoy browsing through their wide range of greatly curated book selections. They recommend and feature new books almost every week. There's really nothing to complain about this cafe except for their customer service. Nothing too major but I'd always expect baristas to be a lil but more engaging and friendly given the welcoming nature of coffee shops.","The Wormhold is a neat little place, decked out in 80s decor. The coffee was good, which is the main reason you'd come to a coffeeshop. However, I was underwhelmed by the baked goods. For me, I love to pair my coffee in the morning with some form of a baked good, whether it be a donut or a muffin or something else. I tried a few items from here, and they were all only okay. The donut was interesting- very, very dense, and not like a donut at all. I tried a muffin as well, but I guess since everything is vegan, they taste different than I'm used to? Certainly not bad, but not what I was expecting. I know most people love this place though, so I guess it just wasn't for me! Coffee and service were both great, however.","Stopped by for a quick breakfast before leaving the city. We had the Bageler, a plain bagel with cream cheese and an ice coffee. The Bageler was wonderful. All the ingredients were cooked just the right amount and the bagel was fresh. I highly recommend the sea salt bagel. It was delicious. The plain bagel with cream cheese was perfect. No need to dress up a well made bagel. They also warmed up the bagel which was a nice touch. The ice coffee was fresh and strong. There was free wifi and light music playing in the background. Food came out quickly and many customers stopped in on the go. Not frills at this bagel shop, but who needs anything special when the food is great? Will be going back next time I'm in Chicago.",Not only is this place cozy and quaint and full of charm but it smells great. No big chain feel here. This is an independent coffee shop with an amazing menu and delicious food. I've been coming here for almost 20 years and it always has that special feel. Plus quiche!,"Cupitol is the capitol of all things brunch!  This cute, quaint restaurant gives a fresh take on your favorite dishes but especially brunch.  The decor is trending & relaxing with high & low top tables & a lounge area with comfy sitting chairs & couches.  As for the food it is so delicious that even the leftovers taste as good as when you first ordered them and that's rare.  I ordered the Berry Mascarpone with scrambled eggs & fresh home-cut fries & when I tell you it's like a party in your mouth you better believe me.  The Berry Mascarpone had two thick pieces of French toast adorned with a berry medley & a cream cheese infused between the two pieces of toast.  It's a healthy portion but delicious non the less.  The flavors were just the right touch of sweet but not too sweet that you felt like you were eating a dessert.  And the Home-cut fries were fresh and lightly seasoned with salt and oh so delicious.  I was surprised that I was able to equally enjoy the food in the day because leftovers don't usually wow me but these leftovers were still good & tasty!Now to the cocktails...I really enjoyed the Refreshing Cucumber.  The blend of Bourbon, Ginger Ale, Cucumber, & Lemon Juice.  It wasn't too sweet & the blends of flavors really complimented each other.  This drink is truly one for summer.  Light, cool, & refreshing!!!  It was my first visit here but it definitely won't be my last.  I'd rate this place with 2 thumbs up, a Snap, & in Z Formation (a little In Living Color humor but you catch my drift...I loved the place!!!)lol",I had drip coffee that was pretty weak.  The medium size is kind of a joke.  It would be a small anywhere else (other than at a place serving cuban coffee).  The coffee is 2 stars but the brie and fig and pear sandwich was a solid 3 star so I rounded up.  I love the look of the place.  It was packed.  I must missing something. I don't quite understand the following but I will try a bar drink next time and hope it packs a better punch than the drip coffee.  Free wifi is nice.,Came  in with high expectations on how a coffee roasteries should be doing a pretty latte art but it came out with no latte art at all.,"They made me an excellent Flat White, despite it not being a menu item :)   Bit of a wait but the place was pretty busy.  Found a seat ok and jumped on the WiFi to do a little work before grabbing another Flat White to go.  Nice ambience and friendly staff with the Hipster vibe","So a friend recommend this place today for lunch, and it did not disappoint! The ambience of this place is really chill and laid back, my type of place. They offer soul food with a little bit of a twist! I had the shrimp and grits, which was my first time ever ordering it out at a restaurant. The grits were cooked perfect and so where the shrimp, it had this lemon gravy like sauce which was very strong in flavor, I did like it, even though at times it was a bit to strong, so if trying this beware of the bold seasonings in this dish! This place also has a coffee bar, which I tried their salted caramel almond espresso iced, which was very delicious! To top all of that off I had one of their home made biscuits with their homemade jam, my oh my it melted in my mouth!! The staff were extremely friendly and I would definitely try this place out again!!",,"I really liked the decor, the art work, and the build out with exposed brick of this place. It's great that they located in Englewood, this space is needed there. Ilike the pay it forward. As a vegan the menu was a challenge for me. My hot chocolate with soy milk was great though. Free wifi, great space to get a little work done. It they had more vegan options I would increase the stars.","Our family had lunch here when we visited Chicago in July, 2018.  I had a version of a Chicago dog, my kids had Garbage Burgers, and my husband had a fried chicken dish.  All of us enjoyed our food.  I especially liked the atmosphere at Medici; it is a fun casual place.","I want to love Plein Air but honestly, I don't.  The staff at the cash register seem bored & are consistently rude, quality is inconsistent (my most recent meal was cold), and often it's so crowded you can't get a seat! On the positive, the bussers are always friendly, the quality of food is very high and the location is great.  If only it was more welcoming and inviting! :-/","They need to polish up on the customer service.... ordered online and they made the order incorrectly. Tried to get it corrected but some guy claiming to be the owner was a real douche bag with zero people skills. The owner literally told me f-u-c-k you when I objected to his rude tone regarding an order they made incorrectly. He hung up in my face and I had to call 5 times to find out how to get my order correct, so I asked if I needed to come over there and he said he'd call the police and knows what my address is. He scolded me and said I need to listen to him. At that point I said to him you are clearly a racist. He kept saying I don't know what your race is and I said you are a white man and you know I am black and would never talk to a white customer this way. I finally got a refund from DoorDash after he refused to give the new Dasher a remake of my order.... he told her I was an a-s-s-h-o-l-e and they were not remaking my order. I guess Blacks who live South of his shop don't deserve customer service or respect. Hey man don't let those Ratings go to your head.... you can still go out of business if you keep being a Jerk!"
36,Under new management and seeing some nice changes. Coffee is good and love looking at the local art displayed on the walls. It's a nice place to zone out and enjoy a cup of joe!,Lovely. Bright and sunny. Music was at the right volume. Drinks served in glasses instead of plastic  unless you specify.,The coffee was okay.  They had intriguing tools you could use to brew your own coffee the intelligentsia way at home.  Coffee pots and weird shaped funnels.  The pricing is pretty expensive.   The ambiance was a little bare but tolerable.,"Lured me in, took my money, then was effectively asked to leave.I discovered this place while looking for a cafe that would be open as late as possible, as I had a long night of work ahead of me and needed coffee somewhere that didn't have all the distractions of home. This is a very normal thing, and I see many of us doing it in cafes all the time. This specific location is open until 11 during the week, so it seemed like a perfect spot. Upon arrival, I read the various signage on the door. Notices about changing hours and the like, and nothing that affected me this evening, so I went inside. For a cafe, this places is extremely loud. Most of this is due to the height of the small room coupled with the classic Chicago copper top ceiling tiles, but it's definitely exacerbated by the way-too-loud music and the tipsy people yelling over it. This place is far more bar than cafe, though they did appear to be offering a full cafe menu. There were many seats & tables available, as it was a weeknight and after 9pm. I ordered a cardamom rose latte, which ended up being DELICIOUS. While waiting for my drink, I set up in a remote dark corner away from most everyone, and opened my laptop. Within minutes I was set upon by a staff member who informed me of a ""No laptops past 7PM"" policy. This seemed bizarre, and I've never experienced this anywhere in my many, many years of working remotely, especially not in a place which calls itself a cafe. I apologized, and let them know I wouldn't have caused this scene had I known, and perhaps a sign on the door would be a good idea, as it would have kept me from even coming inside. The staff member was pleasant and apologetic, and said he himself had suggested the sign, but it was shot down. Very odd, as there were (as I had mentioned before) other signs posted on the door. I suspect this is to lure people in and get some money from them before telling them they can't work in there and hope they stay for some more drinks anyway, whereas letting them know up front results in fewer sales. Clever racket, but comes eerily close to bait-and-switch. I was, at least, offered the option of a refund or a to-go cup. That seems like very cordial compensation, except the option of ""put the laptop away and enjoy your stay here"" was very obviously missing. I cannot determine why I was being treated this way. I looked as well-kempt as the rest of the patrons; I was not dressed in some offensive manner. . .they just decided I was not wanted there. I was at least given a coupon for a free drink, which is nice and all, but I'm not sure when I'd ever be back. The only reason I had gone there to begin with was that it claimed to be a late-night cafe; I have many other cafes closer to me that are perfectly fine, and this one has already made it clear I'm not wanted there. After all of this was squared away, I STILL didn't have my drink. I had to then hang around awkwardly after everyone knew I had been asked to leave. It was terribly embarrassing. It's great that we live in a place where we're allowed to choose the amenities we personally want our businesses to provide, but it becomes problematic when we lure people in with the assumption of amenities, take their money, and then let them know they were wrong. If you want to be a bar, that's great, but call yourself a bar. If you don't want people on their phones or laptops, that's your prerogative, but throw a small sign up, as Violet Hour does. Heck, turn the wifi off after 7, as Cafe Mustache does (they also have signage). Do SOMETHING. Don't just lure people in, take their money and then tell them if they want to be productive they'll have to leave.","Came in here with a friend on a Monday afternoon. We were looking for a spot to have a beverage and chat. I got a soy latte - it was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised, great coffee here. My friend got a whiskey boozy drink which he enjoyed. They actually have vegan baked goodies which is a nice plus although I didn't get any this time (during my visit the selection included peanut butter cookie, banana nut muffin). I like the book store aspect - it was fun to browse through and I like the selection that is available. The cafe had a ""library"" feeling to it - it was strangely quiet, everyone else there was on a laptop with headphones. We were the only ones talking and I felt like I had to whisper. Some of the patrons who came in to grab a to-go drink and browse the book selection were chatting while they were there. We ended up leaving to find a different place to sit down and have a conversation.I'd certainly return for the great coffee if I needed a quiet place to work in the area!","Nostalgia is a funny, fuzzy thing. It's also a powerfully selling tool and this cuteass geek-chic coffee shop delivers 80s nostalgia in glorious spades. I mean, they have an actual DeLorean (the time machine from Back to the Future) inside. It's as if they're actually sending you through time. Meta. It is worth noting that most of Wormhole's patrons (and staff!) are likely born after the 80s. Like I said, nostalgia is a funny thing. You can be nostalgic for a time when you didn't even exist. Not that this applies to me. I'm old and definitely on this earth before the decade came to a close. Anyway, my regular drink order is the ""Cool but Rude."" It's a ginger + curry latte. Sounds insanely weird but is actually subtle and delicious. I've also tried the Peanut Butter Koopa-Troopa. It's not bad but I don't love  peanut butter flavored things. It is a top drink choice for many though. The vanilla bean latte is also popular, but seems like such a plebeian pick. But hey, your choice. Conclusion: a must visit if you're in Chicago and into anything quirky, sci-fi, geek-chic, nostaglic, 80s...all of the above.","Their bagels and service do not disappoint!Their sesame seed bagel with giardiniera cream cheese is the bees-knees. You'll thank me later and I will charge you a bagel for the recommendation.Their prices are also reasonable. A flavored iced coffee, bagel and cream cheese comes to $5. For Chicago, that's great!The place can be a little tough to find and you can easily walk right past it (like I did the first time). Just look for the decal on their window and enjoy the deliciousness to come.","Really great ambience here as well as coffee and food options!The space itself is very inviting and makes me want to explore every nook and cranny inside haha. The coffee options are simple and direct with the usual cappuccinos and lattes. The food menu on the other hand is expansive and it took me a bit of time to finally decide whether I wanted a quiche or breakfast bowl. Sure, the prices are quite steep, but after one bite of my food and one sip of my coffee, I really can't complain.I ordered the 12oz Latte with the spinach quiche. My boyfriend ordered the straight up coffee with a breakfast bowl. The coffees were both flavorful and really hit the spot for the both of us. That afternoon pump was much needed. The food was amazing! The quiche was perfectly seasoned and the crust was flaky and delicious! The breakfast bowl packed so much flavor. We couldn't have asked for a better afternoon pick us up!","Super place, lovely staff and caring people, nice atmosphere!!!Even a place for your puppy","Ham & gruyere croissant and chocolate chip scones were very yummy, but was disappointed that the kitchen wasn't open on Saturdays for sandwiches and other things I planned to try ahead of time. Overall was a pleasant breakfast and will be returning again. Boyfriend ate all my croissant :(","Love this coffee shop.  Coffee is delicious, chocolate scone is perfect, staff friendly, and the location and vibe is great.  Go here every time I am in the area.",$4.46 for a medium cup of coffee? LOL!!!Why on earth would anyone return? Is the coffee that great? Nope.,"First time visiting and it was pretty good. Went with my gf and we ordered brunch. I got the fish and grits which came with collard greens. I also got the vanilla bean coffee Expresso which was pretty tasty. Coming in caught me off guard because you have to order right away at the front where they make the coffee. Didn't too much like that.. Wanted to sit down and relax then look it over. You also have to pay before you even get the meal! So as we sat down no waiter came up and there was no water on the table. As I continued to look around I noticed others getting up and grabbing from a table, that's when I got up and saw that's where the water and napkins and knives forks etc are! Someone should of said something off back. Never been here and not knowing how things operate was very frustrating! But my catfish was delicious! Food is very good here. I will be back",,Nice little gem on the Southside. Really enjoy coming in here. The atmosphere is always welcoming and the sandwiches are good and the coffee is amazing. I never get a headache from drinking their cafe like that prestitution Starbucks.  Looking forward to our next visit.,"This place was part of my childhood, adolescence and even my adult years!  What started as Hans Morsbach's little coffee shop in the late 50s and has grown through a couple of relocations (that I know of - maybe they are on location #4 or more?) and is a staple of what was my Hyde Park experience of the 70s and 80s.  Somehow the current incarnation has preserved enough of the vibe of the last place - further east on 57th - that it still feels familiar.They still make an awesome deep dish pizza!  They still make an amazing eggs benedict!  Somehow, the notion of all you care to squeeze OJ has even survived to this day.Go check them out - anyone who grew up in the neighborhood will tell you the same thing - the Med is a great place to eat, sit, chat, and generally unwind.","Good brunch place But definitely over pricedNice coffee and tea Good environmentStaff are friendly Next by a nice bookstore, which is the best!","I have always been wondering if there was any good coffee shop around the University of Chicago.  Back in January this year, my Yelp Elite friends, Eva. S and Jen B. (Hi, girls) showed me this Indie coffee shop passport.  Robust Coffee Lounge in Woodlawn was on the list.  I finally made it here with Daddy J.  RCL technically isn't ""on"" campus, but it's south of UC border on the southwest corner of Woodlawn and 63rd.  Their coffee is reasonably-priced.  For $8 and some change, we had a large, bold, and wake-me-up Americano and a large, mildly-spiced, calm-me-down Diablo mocha.  I actually like this place a lot for these following reasons:1) free working wifi2) bright lighting through large windows3) plenty of seating for solo and group travelers4) friendly service 5) good selections of books, magazines, and newspapers They accept major credit cards (not sure about the minimum purchase).  It's also accessible via #63 bus (with a seasonal service east to the 63rd. St. Beach).Ok, now I'm done with the review.  It's time for me to space out at RCL..."
37,"Love the feel of this place. Food was great. Coffee was better. Everyone was super friendly. The owner really knows his stuff. Talked to me about the difference between beans, their flavors and where there from. I recommend this spot to anyone who appreciates a lowkey setting, great affordable coffee, dope music selection and inspiring local art.","Great coffee shop.Cool atmosphere. Prompt, attentive service. High quality product.","THE COFFEEWatch out Wormhole, Filter, Caffe Streets, and Ipsento, Intelligentsia has arrived!!! Hands down, this is third wave coffee at its finest. The coffee here is IMPECCABLE! It's smooth, creamy, and the notes are so on point. I got the Matalapa El Salvador - I tasted a floral essence with hints of honey, which was simply divine. No cream or sugar needed. However, expect to wait longer than your normal Starbucks time and to pay a little more ($4/cup), but for true coffee lovers - this is the best new thing to come to Wicker Park. Note that soy milk is actually free, which is really great for all the vegan loving hipsters in Wicker.THE AMBIANCEThis place is very modern and warm with large windows allowing the fresh sunshine to come in and wake up the customers if the coffee doesn't do the trick. It is lined with plastic red boxes used as stools, long black tables for community sharing, and lit with rows of lights dangling from the ceiling. It is quite small but it looks like there is free wi-fi and multiple places to sit to get some work done. The tables were displayed with fresh fragrant bouquets of beautiful flowers, so nice that they look like centerpieces at a reception. I hope these will always be there! The servers are all very friendly and look like they enjoy what they are doing. There are multiple french presses, scales, coffee, and t-shirts for sale. All in all, this place makes me really happy and I am so happy to welcome them to the neighborhood!","Love, love this place! It is a great addition to Bucktown and I love being able to stop by here after a run or walk on the 606. PROS: Great coffee (recently tried the seasonal Basil Mint Mocha, go try it now if you can), there's wine and beer (!!), the large windows that are opened up to the 606 in the warmer months, and the staff is super friendly.CONS: Really the biggest con is that there are so many other people that like this place. I always find myself squeezing through crowds and waiting a bit for my coffee. But that's good for business and it's worth it. Oh, and seated space is limited but the whole point of me going is to hop back on the 606 with coffee in hand or go explore my wonderful neighborhood some more.","Well, as I mentioned in my check in, I am a big supporter of local community establishments such as Volume Bookstore Cafe as I believe they bring character to a community, and, also bring the community together via their casual welcoming cafe environment.I was there last week and asked for a copy of Sapiens, which they did not have in stock. I was told they would order it and it would be in on Wed. I did not order or reserve it. I just went back (Wed) and there it was, as promised. I could have gone home and sat on my duff, pushed a button on my iPad and had it shipped to my apt, probably at a lower cost, but, that doesn't make for great communities or employ our local community residents with living wages. I don't live in that hood, several miles away actually, but felt it important to support them.I was especially thrilled to hear that they were also a Women owned business.  Delightful people working there and delicious coffee. Show them some love!","The Wormhole Coffee brings you back to the '80s, with its great collection of TMNT, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, and Back to the Future (yes, a replica of the car was situated on top of a makeshift divider) figurines, posters, and other paraphernalia.  In addition, they have locally-roasted coffee, vegan donuts, and hot/cold beverages, including ever-changing specialty beverages.  A group of us came here after having lunch in the area, and the place was noticeably super packed!  We ordered: the Koopa-Troopa (a peanut butter mousse and dark chocolate latte; more strong and bitter, with a slight hint of peanut butter; came with a nice latte art on top); Holy Water (with jasmine green tea, melon, and honey, iced; this was super refreshing, and while it was more melon-based, I really enjoyed it!); a regular glazed donut, a sprinkles donut, and a crumbled frosted donut.  The yeast donuts were large and airy, and tasted pretty good.  There is a hodge-podge of furniture - solo chairs and sofas where you can do some work, play catch-up, and/or to just relax.  Imagine a friend's living room where you just hang out.The place isn't much for large groups, but maybe up to 3 people.  I loved the '80s decor, and I'd be interested in checking out their other specialty beverages that seem to change often!Some residential parking can be found off of Milwaukee.+Holy Water+vegan donuts+'80s decor+limited seating+limited parking off of Milwaukee",Just got an almond croissant and the pumpkin pie latte. It was missing a bit of nutmeg or something. I'd want to come back to try a bagel sandwich,"The food is amazing, the service is slow and spotty. Young kids working aren't very professional or warm. That being said if you're just here for the food it's delicious","Great selection of food items and drinks, lots of nice seating, and friendly staff! We ordered the Matcha Latte, Mocha Latte, Benedict, and the Sweet Potato Bowl.The Matcha Latte was not overly grainy with excess powder. It was very creamy and had a nice balance between the sweetness from the soy milk to the slight bitterness of the Matcha powder. It was a great sip to start the morning!The Mocha Latte was rich, creamy, and perfectly chocolately! It was not overly sweet and satisfied our sweetness craving well for the morning. The foam on top was very rich and luxurious. Every sip was heavenly!The Benedict came with two very generous patties. The gravy was also very flavorful and delicious. It was one of he more hearty items on the menu. The Sweet Potato bowl was nice and hearty, but a little bland. Since there is a lot of brown rice, there was not much seasoning unless your every bite had a chunk of sweet potato. The Vegan Curry is a nice touch, but a little on the soupy side and needs to be more rich and creamy to add more flavor.","Slooooow, unenthusiastic service. Counter gal wasn't aware if they had chips or not. Order was lost. Served on the wrong bread. Beef was very good (that's all I ate). $11.00 and still starving. Never again.","Cute coffee shop in the Streeterville area with decent coffee and plenty of room for studying.I love the large windows and the high ceilings. It's the perfect spot for to chill, study, or get some work done. It wasn't too packed on a Tuesday afternoon, and there were many available seats. Seating also varies from couches, tables, bar stools by window seats - so there's something for everyone. Wifi is reliable and solid.I ordered their honey cinnamon latte special - it was good, but too light for my taste since I like darker roasts.","Visiting from out of state and we happened to walk by. Stopped in for a coffee and chai (really good). Cool place, great quality.","Had an awesome lunch here today! Sad I hadn't tried this place sooner! I had a southwest salad with chicken, they fry the tortilla strips fresh and the dressing is delicious . My husband had the fried chicken sandwich and said it was made perfectly. We both shared a biscuit which was super buttery and fluffy and delicious. The matcha and mint iced latte was soooooooooo good :) !!! The service was friendly and very accommodating and the prices were perfect for the portion sizes and clean atmosphere. We will be regular customers !",,The warmest welcome I've ever had visiting a restaurant the food and the service was outstanding I couldn't ask for a better experience. This is totally a hitting gym in the middle of Englewood. You totally escaped the surroundings once you're inside very lovely place :-),"Impossible burger, delicious fries, and other vegan options. They also let you create your own pizza, thin crust or pan, with vegan cheese if you want. Food came out very quickly.","I go to Plein Air almost everyday because it's definitely one of the best cafes that I've ever been to in my life. Their latte, pastries and biscuit are absolutely AMAZING; other dishes are also very tasty. It also has a nice study vibe, having a little bit of a buzz but not noisy at all. A perfect place to grab a quick lunch with friend, go on a date or have some alone time and treat yourself.",This is my first review in years! Just moved to Chicago and had to review this place.  The coffee is smooth and strong. The smoothie are made with honest to God real fruit (unlike some places I've noticed claim are made with REAL fruit but it's just syrup).  The coffee comes in XXL which is like a large soda at the movie theater.  Yes ma'am sign me up!The food is great too with vegan/vegitarian options.
38,"Every time I come to Chicago the Gallery Cafe is on my ""must stop"" list. I've had coffee all over Chicago including the premium price, ultra trendy hotspots. You name the brand or the coffee shop and I bet I've had it or been there. I don't do lattes or barista required concoctions. I want dark roast straight up black. And no one does it better than the Gallery. Especially for the price. Proves that the quality of the coffee isn't measured by what you paid for it. They have great sandwiches and wraps - I'm particularly fond of the breakfast sandwich selections, all named after a famous painter. Outstanding. For a small place, they really serve it up huge.",Nothing too exciting going on here but it's a great coffee shop in the area. It's a great place to hide away and study. It's also low-key compared to all the coffee shops that have too many tourists inside. I'd say this is a neighborhood gem at most. Go ahead and grab your coffee and bounce!,"$7 for a small matcha latte -I'm sorry I'm a coffee and tea lover but that price is outrageous. Also, the only menu they have is a small menu at the counter and when you step up they make you feel pressured to place your order. Put a menu up if you want people to be prepared. With all the coffee shops in this neighborhood-save yourself some cash and go elsewhere.","Loved it! I had first tried Ipsento Coffee at another cafe in LaGrange IL that serves Ipsento. I had ordered the Guatemala Huehuetenango pour-over and fell in love. I saw that the coffee shop sold the exact coffee and out of curiosity searched the company only to find out they have a couple locations in Chicago!We also had a taste of each of their little donuts and the cinnamon sugar was my favorite! I tried both of their cheese boards which were a yummy and filling snack.We'll be back again as I love that they're open til 11pm. I ended up getting the Guatemala coffee (being Guatemalan I had to get it and plus I loved it that much).See you soon, Ipsento!","I'm raving about this new addition to Wicker Park... a charming, independently-owned book store with its very own cafe. It's owned by two sisters with backgrounds in education. And it fulfills two of my biggest passions, caffeine and books! Yesterday, I came here on a mission... to purchase a children's book for my neighbors, who are recent first-time parents. In the back of the store, there's a section devoted just to books for children. Volumes has a super selection. There are even a couple of pint size tables where the little ones can read and do activities. After looking through dozens of books, found one I hope my neighbors will love as much as I do.This is a pretty large space for a local bookstore. The majority is devoted to grown-ups. The shelves are stocked with many current sellers, plus lots of vintage books I hadn't thought about for years. An avid reader, I could do some serious damage in this store!In addition to books, there's a cafe with baristas, and lots of seating where you can sip caffeine (or wine and craft beer) and work on your laptop. Didn't look like there was much in the way of food except for pastries. And compared to a Starbucks, which can get really noisy, Volumes is almost serene. I'm looking forward to literary events as unique as they are.",My type of place! Video game themed and cool spot to hang out. I like their cool but rude latte with nice ginger spice in it.,"Ever since moving to Chicago, I've been searching for my go-to bagel spot. I think I found it with The Bagelers Coffeehouse. I love their everything bagel with plain cream cheese, but they also have other cream cheese options. Their bagels and cream cheese are made in-house. There is also plenty of seating on weekday mornings.","Catcher in the Rye  1/2 sandwich was a smaller whole sandwich on grilled marbled rye.  Corned Beef was tender and piled with perfect sauerkraut and melted Swiss.  Tasty pickle wedge on the side.  Confused on Salade Nicoise.  ""Our version of this French classic, our tuna dill salad surrounded by portions of boiled new potatoes, tomatoes, hardboiled egg, artichoke hearts, cucumbers, red onions, nicoise olives of course and anchovies (optional). Served with balsamic vinaigrette.""  Delicious tuna salad, but no eggs, potatoes, dressing or anchovies although I requested it.  Traditional Nicoise has solid tuna chunks (good quality canned is acceptable) and green beans.  The small generous olives were pitted and not appropriate.  They need to tweak this recipe to be successful.","10/10 I LOVE this place. I can spend all day here, and I often do. It is the perfect spot to study. The wifi is fast, they have coffee refills, and the vibe is amazing. Cozy, clean, and beautiful. One of the larger coffee shops that I've been to in Chicago with a lot of different options for seating. Outlets are a little sparse so if you are planning to camp out make sure you charge your stuff before coming! Food is AMAZING and you get a lot for the price. I've tried the Spanish Omelette, Breakfast Sandwich, Brownies, and Chai Latte. All of which have exceeded my expectations. The portions are hearty and the service is pleasant. I will be back.",This place has good coffee and tasty croissants. I would love to come back!! I had an almond latte from their special coffee menu and got two croissants (one with beef & mustard and the other one with cranberry & peanut butter)~,"Great environment to study at, very peaceful vibe and open area. I ordered the Nutella Mocha, Matcha Latte, and Roast Beef sandwich. Drinks were ok, tasted a little watered down, but the sandwiches were very tasty and included potato salad and a pickle.","The pour overs and espresso need no additional reviews - all has been said about how delicious they are - I had an oatmilk cappuccino. I must add that the rooibos tea was a surprisingly fantastic selection on a rainy, dreary evening. If you are looking for a non-caffeinated option, order the rooibos. Enjoy!","This place is so eccentric, I love it! I've been a Chicagoan my whole life and I'm so happy I discovered this cafe. Whenever I'm in town, I will make a stop here. I got the shrimp and grits: DELISH! My friend ordered some fries and they were soooo good! They also had a DJ who was killing it with the vibes. I love this place so much!",,"I love it here. The ambiance is dope and the people are extremely accommodating. I haven't any complaints. I've eaten here once (Funkadelic Chicken Sandwich) and it was tasty. I also ordered a peanut butter cookie which was just okay. I highly recommend it as a place to visit. Whether alone to chill, to study, or with a group of friends/colleagues.","Came for brunch and boy were they busy! This restaurant has a very homey feel and charm. Their booths can be a bit snug so I prefer to sit at the tables. Service here is excellent and the food comes out very quickly during brunch. The omelettes come with potatoes and choice of bread. It was one of the most filling brunches I've ever had and everything was delicious. The ingredients for the omelettes are not mixed with the eggs, but folded into the middle. They did not skimp at all and it was a super large omelette that I had difficulty finishing. The only downside to their brunch menu is that they lack a variety of menu options that pairs savory with sweet. You can get a single stack of pancakes but not sure it could apply to the specialty pancakes or french toast. For those who want a little sweet and a little savory, this menu is a bit limitation. For those who are no fuss and want more traditional, delicious brunch, this is the place to go!","Plain Air is one of my favorite places to stop for breakfast. The exterior seating is lovely and the interior is light and airy. All of their pastries and quiches are fantastic, and I also really enjoy the biscuit breakfast sandwich. Very good coffee and tea options. It's really a gem in the neighborhood.",This is my snow day destination!  Cozy and friendly with a delicious assortment of sandwiches and baked goods.  Hot coffee and delicious coffee drinks as well.
39,Went into for the first time today. Wasn't super impressed. I tried the iced coffee. The barista told me they just pour hot coffee and espresso over ice. Not terrible but definitely not a cold press. I'd be willing to try a latte if I stop in again. Atmosphere is pretty normal for a neighborhood shop. Any place that roasts their own beans can't be too terrible.Prices aren't bad either. I paid less than three bucks for an iced coffee with caramel.,"Talk about hipster. Coming from spending a lot of time in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, I easily made myself at home. This place had been recommended to me by a friend who lives in the area. I could see now why. There's a ton of seating, cool rustic atmosphere, and a pretty extensive menu with drinks and food. I just got a drip coffee, but I could really taste the crisp flavor of the coffee beans.I was surprised for a Saturday afternoon that there were a ton of people working and eating a late brunch. For the amount of tables there were, I was only able to find a seat at their bar off to the side of the espresso machine. Their wifi is good, which is always a big plus in my book. I'm glad I was recommended this place. The next time I'm in the area in need of coffee, I know exactly where to go.","Intelligentsia. The Queen of Coffee.My macchiato was Intelligentsia's Black Cat classic espresso blend. Complex; a higher class of coffee. It was faultless. Served in a red, red room, with sparkling water.In spite of aristocratic surroundings, I received no snobbery of the baristas. They were wonderfully helpful and friendly.","I started coming to Ipsento back in February. I'd come in after an evening of work at a nearby spa, tired and ready to decompress. The friendly staff here is amazingly patient and will discuss any drink on their menu at length to really make sure you get the perfect fit. Back then, I opted for The Sweater Weather - nice and boozy.  Served with a square ice cube it has true staying power. Now I try to branch out a bit to get to know the menu a little better. I now try to visit Ipsento when ever I am in Bucktown.","Volumes Bookcafe is another gem in the heart of Work. They have a great selection of titles and their drink offers are spectacular! I recommend to anyone looking for a nice drink to relax, or a fun literary event to attend. Great place for a social meetup or to study.","An 80s coffee shop run by someone who used to run Darwin's in Cambridge? Seriously that is awesome. The space is filled with 80s memorabilia including plastic and tin lunchboxes that I just wanted to take down and bring to work, discs next to a Macintosh computer (pictured), and just a funky vibe. Was in the neighborhood and decided to stop in, I definitely want to do work there soon to take me back to my baby years especially bc there must be more to see on the wall. Oh and I ordered a soy chai tea with a croissant. Yum!",Pros: Best bagels in Chicago. Line out the door on Sunday proves it. Chive onion cream cheese is incredible. Croissants are unreal Cons: coffee is mehNo allergens or ingredients listed so assuming nothing is GF or vegan,"This place has lost a lot of its charm for me, mostly because of the customer service. I have spent many an afternoon here studying and have usually enjoyed it. The ambience and product tend to be pretty good. I came here recently to meet a friend to study. I ordered an iced tea and was informed (without apology) that they were out. Okay, fine...I ordered an iced coffee and a Great Gatsby sandwich. I am handed my iced coffee and it is white as milk. I am not kidding. The barista hands it to me with a shrug and says ""we have a very light brew today."" Alright...so I took a sip and it tasted like it looked - like watery milk. I asked the barista to dump it out and add more coffee, thinking he just added WAY too much milk. Nope. That, for whatever reason, is how their coffee looked. I opted for a cup of hot coffee instead (without being offered any kind of refund...lame). It was watery, but at least it was the right color. I wasn't about to try to order a fourth drink. The bathrooms were gross and the staff all had an attitude. There are way better coffee shops around (I recommend NextDoor on Diversey, although it has a really different vibe).","I found this place on Instagram and told my husband about it because it's two blocks from us and the food looked good. We came in today as first timers and we ordered off the menus. We sat waiting for our food for about 30-45 mins for a waffle, bacon, and omelette with toast, That was flag one. Then they brought our food to us in to-go boxes! We told them we were dining in. So they took the food out the containers and brought it to us and our food was sooooo cold and the waffle was very hard. My husbands omelette was cold, toast cold and they brought me another waffle out but it was hard as a rock and I had to drain it in syrup to make it soft but that didn't help much at all! Not to mention the server didn't bring me any syrup so I had to walk up and ask her for some and she handed me the jar or syrup. Pretty as the picture - perhaps? experience - I'll pass!","This place opened a couple days ago in my office building. I was excited since I've seen good reviews at other locations. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. The menu has a lot of great options for both hot and cold coffee and tea options. I saw that almond milk was an option ($0.60 charge), so I decided on a 12 oz. cappuccino. I really like coffee so I prefer a 1/2 coffee, 1/2 milk cappuccino. I know that's not normally an option. Most places do 2/3 milk, 1/3 coffee, and that's fine. I watched the girl behind the counter make mine. She poured about 8 oz  of milk out and steamed it. Then she brewed one shot of espresso and put it in.. So I paid almost $5 (tax included) for a glass of frothy milk with a tinge of coffee taste. My coworker order a 12 oz iced americano. The same thing. We saw them fill the glass with ice and water, almost to the top and then added 1 shot of espresso. It was so weak, another coworker thought she was drinking iced tea. While I was waiting for my drink, one of the guys behind me ordered a regular 16 oz coffee. They poured a cup with about 12 oz of coffee in it. He was rightfully upset and asked that if he is going to pay for 16 oz, he expects to get them. It's similar pricing to any other coffee shop you might find in the Loop, but I did not get what I paid for.",I'm so glad found this coffee shop on yelp during my visit to Chicago! The baristas were super friendly and they had tons of non-dairy milk options. I loved my oat-milk honey cinnamon latte! I can't wait to come back to Chicago and bring my husband here!,"Awesome coffee.  Had a soy latte.  So smooth, so strong.  So delicious.  The croissants with almond are quite delicious, too.  Well worth the price/the trek if you aren't nearby.  Just stock up on their bags of coffee!","I love this space! The food was delicious! I had the blue plate special with biscuit and tea. As a vegetarian, it's nice to find some soul food I can eat! :) the staff are incredibly friendly, the clientele is very diverse, which is a nice change from what I've seen in the rest of the city. And the space is beautiful. I will definitely be coming back here regularly. Love supporting local businesses, especially when they're as good as this!",,"I found a gem in Englewood. I love everything about this cafe. It's so cozy, the people are welcoming, the artistic atmosphere is attractive and it's such a great gathering place. I had an opportunity to have a very short conversation with I'm assuming one of the stakeholders or operators (who ever he is) but I learned that the cafe is a nonprofit organization and has no one person as the owner but the people of Englewood are owners. Love it. I'm a fan.  KUSANYA cafe","Came here with my bf for the first time. Service was friendly and all of our food came on time. We shared the salmon burger, goat cheese pizza, almond croissant, regular croissants and two teas. To be honest the croissants were the star of the meal. Everything else just seemed a bit bland. The salmon burger tasted really under-seasoned,  and was just masked by the chipotle mayo. The pizza was cooked perfectly, but lacking the taste. If you like cheese you may love it. The goat cheese was good, but just seemed like it needed something. So three stars for the food not for the service. I would give the service a 4.5.",Glad that they were open during construction. I was in the area and wanted to stop in for a beverage and sweet treat. I would have preferred to dine in but the way the seating was set up there was no room for me so I just kept it moving up Lake Shore Drive.,LOVE this coffee shop in Woodlawn. Breakfast sandwiches are perfect hangover food. The space is really creative and unique.
40,Super close to my house so it's really convenient. Coffee is always on point and consistent and the staff is lovely!,"I'm beyond ashamed to write a yelp review about avocado toast - but Jesus titty-Fucking Christ you guys, it's so damn good. Go there, get that.Apparently I still have to write words to make this qualify as a review, so the coffee is good too. Also fuck mike pence.",As good as all other Intelligentsia locations. Really good coffee and super friendly staff.,"Dragging myself through O'Hare, I knew I needed a good jolt of caffeine before hitting the parking lot known as the Chicago highway leading to downtown loop.  I quickly yelped and saw Ipsento as a good place and it did not disappoint.  This is a neighbourhood coffee place that has a lot of cozy seating where a lot of quiet groups of people are working.  Service is warm and helpful... I was debating between a dirty chai or their seasonal REAL pumpkin spice coffee drink.  I ended up getting a dirty chai and it was a good one as you can taste a balance of the espresso shot and spices.  It wasn't overly sweet which was a nice relief.  If I'm ever in this spot again, I'll definitely come back to try more of their coffees.  Great place and would recommend.","Great local bookstore/cafe in the heart of Wicker Park. They have a variety of fiction and nonfiction, as well as a section for children's books. They haven't always had a book I was looking for but the order process is very easy and I've gotten any order within a week. It's also a great spot to sit and do some work. The cafe has good coffee/latte drinks and free WiFi. Also it's super cute. What's not to like?","Not enough seating for the amount of people coming in and out. Chai was definitely made in-house, but had too much cinnamon for my liking. Staff seemed friendly enough though, and the 80s decor is awesome. Update: came in a few days later and tried the Koopa Troopa. The peanut butter balanced the strength of the coffee nicely. Could've used more chocolate in mine, but will likely reorder this.","It's a decent bagel and coffee shop, fairly cute with and almost rustic ambiance. Being from NY I'm rather picky about my bagel so it's missing some of that ideal almost doughy texture. Way better than Einstein's or Panera's monstrosities though, if I had to guess they probably steam than bake instead of boil than bake. Don't drink coffee so I can't comment on that, the latte I got was fairly standard fair though, I think if it was slightly less sweet it would have been phenomenal. Their cream cheese is legit tho, would come again. Above average as far as Chicago is concerned","I've been living down the street from this place for 3 years now. Adorable outdoor seating but unfortunately the service here has been declining upon each visit. They are out of cold brew within the first hour of opening and the employees are frantic behind the counter. This morning they were bickering and audibly arguing in front of a 10 person line by the register. What a shame, I hope they get it together soon because it's just simply unpleasant.","AMAZING DECOR + AMAZING SMOOTHIEStumbled into this joint while wandering back to downtown Chicago from Navy Pier, was very impressed by the decor. The whole place just felt right. High ceilings, a variety of seating options, a perfectly tucked away counter that was right along the entrance. They put a ton of thought into the layout! If I was a local I would definitely spend a lot of time here, even the water dispenser was awesome, with sparkling and still!I was not hungry so can't comment on the pastries but the prices were reasonable and the showcase looked amazing! I had an iteration of a green monster smoothie, with avocado, reasonably priced and delicious!",No need to really review this place because if they can't have cream and Splenda ready and waiting for you they really shouldn't be in business as a coffee shop. love the picnic tables.,"Not sure who was helping these other customers that raved about great customer service because I was just in here for the first time from out of town and these guys were awful. Both female and male behind the counter were silent, unhelpful and made no attempt to let me know when my iced coffee was ready- it sat there on the counter, while my family of four waited with me. Yes, the gal behind the counter told me she'd let me know when it was ready which is why I wasn't hovering over the counter waiting. Seemed like a cool place- nice atmosphere, and good menu but I'd never go back. Try smiling to your customers and acting like you give a sh*t they're standing in front of you next time.","Matcha latte almost makes me cry! As a big fan of the real coffee and tea, I was fed up with the Starbucks style super sweet something. And here I am! Love it, love it, love it! Takes me back to Kyoto!","I have been here two times and both times were consistently good. Staff were nice as pleasant. I ordered something basic and it was good,especially the pancakes! They are always playing dope music! I will be back for sure!",,This is an amazing spot to eat breakfast or lunch in Englewood. I have been working in this community for 4 years and my co workers and I always come here first. Most of the other food options are fast food and this place gives us an opportunity to eat fresh food. I love support local businesses! The staff are always friendly and it has a homey feel. The food is simple and good. Awesome sandwich options and the prices are reasonable.,"The Med is one of those restaurants that you never really go out of your way to go to, but it's there and convenient, especially for many UChicago students.  It's a popular meeting spot/catching up spot, and the bakery is great as an option for easy take out.  They also have outdoor seating so when the weather warms up, it's actually really nice to hang out with friends at the patio.The bakery portion of the Med is great, minus the occasional long lines and the wait time for your drinks to be prepared.  It's even better knowing that if you come an hour before they close, they sell all baked goods 50% off.  I've tried multiple things from the Med, and definitely, the fruit tart is one of my favorites (although I may be biased because I love fruits tarts of any form).  The fruits are made fresh, and often, they put a nice peach or apricot glaze over the tart.  The filling is the perfect amount of sweet and creamy and the crust is a little hard.  I actually had trouble breaking apart the fruit tart to share and the Med bakery portion unfortunately does not have any harder utensils than flimsy plastic knives and forks so my friend and I spent maybe 5 minutes sawing away at the tart (which may be the only downfall).  But it's not as if the hardness takes away from the taste--I think it makes it taste better.  I just wish the Med had less flimsy material to eat the fruit tarts with.  The shakes are another thing I highly recommend--especially, it is worth checking out what the special is as they change often (if you come around autumn, they have an amazing Pumpkin Pie Shake that is to die for).  Overall, the bakery of the Med gets about 4/5 stars in my book.The reason as to why I give the Med, overall, 3 stars is because of the restaurant portion.   The food service can be slow at times, and the food is mediocre at best for the price your paying.  Whereas I highly recommend the bakery portion, the restaurant portion isn't necessarily a ""must-go"".  While the portion sizes are decent and will fill you up, the quality is alright and nothing amazing or special about it.  The main attraction to the Med is the shakes anyways and you can just get that at the bakery next door.",The mf bomb diggity! Scrumdiddlyupsious! My love stopped to bring me some breakfast because I wasn't feeling well. I feel like a million bucks chuck! I had the croissant with egg thick cut xtra Smokey bacon with monchego cheese and home fries! Get you some! Fye bo!,"I wrote one review sharing how disappointed I was in the breakfast bowl I ordered (5.17.16). Since then, I found out that the advertising for the coffee shake is FALSE. The sign says ""cold brewed coffee, cinnamon, almond milk"". The reality is that they use a coffee mix from a packet that contains tons of sugar, saturated fat, and preservatives. One serving is half the packet, but they put the whole packet in for one shake, meaning the calories START at about 500 just for the mix. The ""cinnamon"" is a syrup, adding more sugar to the drink.At least Starbucks is honest about their ingredients for a comparable drink, the coffee frappucino. And, Starbucks ingredients are better for my health. A coffee shop needs to serve real coffee. There's absolutely no excuse for using a cheap mix.Robust Coffee is lying to customers and lagging behind Starbucks for coffee quality. I won't be going back, and am considering contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding their misrepresentation of the product ingredients."
41,"Food is ok, but the hipsters behind the bar don't understand the concept of decorum and treat (more like mistreat) the customers based on their piss poor mood, apparently. If you want a wrap and a sandwich, there are plenty of other options down the street.","Fantastic. There's a coffee shop popping up in a new city everyday so what can one do to differentiate? Be this place. From the subway seating, in the corner, to the GREAT choice of music -- oh and the coffee is actually good! The service was quick and the clientele was dope. I always check out what the audience is for a coffee shop to see if it's a true neighborhood hang. This one fit well. Plenty of people just coming in for a quick cup, stopping to study, or having a work meeting. I was coming off of a long travel day and this place was the perfect place to decompress with a hot americano. Highly recommend!",Came in here for a hot chocolate and coffee today. I clearly asked please for soy milk in the hot chocolate. Low and behold about an hour later I was violently ill. The barista absolutely put regular milk instead of soy in the hot chocolate. Please be more careful in the future guys.,"I can't believe the amount of times that I have been here and not written a review!! I guess... for the most part a lot of times I was still working at Yelp and couldn't leave a review. Anyway. I love this place!! From their great coffee, to their excellent tiny donuts! The perfect place to stop off at on your morning walk to grab a drink or small breakfast!","Volumes is an amazing place to find the books you didn't know you needed in your life! They have an extremely thoughtful selection of books and an awesome place to work and enjoy coffee in the front. I love coming here and finding new books! They have a great selection for kids! I found a few bi-lingual books for my baby sister that I am really excited about. The staff here is extremely kind as well! The ""staff picks"" section is something you need to check out. I had a lovely experience here and I love coming in when I am in Chicago.",Love the coffee and the specialty coffee drinks if you're on the mood for something different and maybe a little sweet. I can honestly say that I'd come back for the decor as I had I'd come back for the coffee. It takes you straight back to childhood in the 80's!  Super fun to sip your brew and check out memory lane,Great little bagel place tucked away in Lincoln Park. The bagels are the best around the area for sure. It does get crowded on the weekends so come early!,"Our sandwiches were good-not great, but we ate them. That's where the 1 star came from. The experience got 0 stars. The lady leaning on the counter kind of stared at us so we ordered then took a seat. While seated we were checking out the place and we both lit on the ceiling fan. The dust was so thick it could have made fluffy filling for a decorative pillow. Then I used the restroom. Besides the visible dirt and dust on every surface, there were clues that the seat hadn't been cleaned recently. Visible clues. Yuck. Won't be back. Sorry.","I was so high on this place... great food, friendly staff and comfortable ambiance. But, I stopped going in because of some inconsistencies with food. I popped back in today and again was underwhelmed. I ordered a tuna sandwich and the tuna salad was the consistency of dip for chips. Argh...","Not a place to go if you value fine coffee properly served.  They serve Metropolis, which can be excellent if properly prepared (try Goddess and the Baker on Wabash--they serve Metropolis coffee that's even better than Metropolis's own cafe).  However, Dollop serves espresso in paper cups even if you tell them you are staying there.  The espresso is good, though possibly brewed a bit under temperature.  If you prefer your espresso in a proper porcelain cup, the Loop options remain Intelligentsia or Goddess.I hope they purchase a case of porcelain cups.  I'd be happy to try them again once they've got the bugs worked out.","This was the second Dollop I visited and I was not disappointed. Located in a great and safe area, it was a clear hub for many students, tourists, and office workers. A girl named Sam took my order, and suggested I try it with a shot of vanilla (delicious!) Again, very kind people. The interior was modern and had lots of different types of seating. They also had some souvenirs and bagged coffee available for purchase. I went to this location twice in my 3 day trip. I recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to get their fix!","It was a really bad experience! I don't recommend drinking espresso coffee, the test was the worse that I never had before! Besides It is really expensive, more than 5 dollars! The service was crazy, I waited for more than 15 min for just one coffee! Guys, maybe if you chose another drink you will have different experience! Good luck! But my husband and I won't return here!","They are closed on Mondays, so Yelp needs to update the hours. I LOVE the interior! There are three full floors. I had the soul food breakfast bowl. Even though I don't like sugar in my greens, it made a great balance of sweet and savory and the greens were seasoned to perfection without the sugar.  The biscuits are to die for! The atmosphere is so laid-back and they serve rum punch! The music is like smooth house. The have DJ Duane Powell from 1-4 on Saturdays.",,"The mocha that smoothed down my throat today was maybe the best coffee I have ever had, apart from a cup served to me in an Ethiopian home a few years ago. Coffee: A+Ambience: A+Customer service: A+And bonus points for loving the Englewood neighborhood!I am headed back tomorrow.","I've been to Medici four times. I want to like it. Badly. But despite the hype, history, and heralded grilled cheese, it's barely three stars in my mind.First visit:The cafe side. Grilled cheese sandwich. Veeeeery greeeeasy. Meh. Second visit:Dine in. Super cool upstairs seating. Loved the atmosphere. My vegetable soup though? Blah. My boyfriend's lasagna didn't wow me either.Third visit:Takeout. Salad with bleu cheese and pesto dressing. I felt really queasy afterward, and I'm not saying it was the food but... Fourth visit:Takeout. Salad with bleu cheese and pesto dressing. Guy at the register was an asshole who made me feel like shit for asking if the salad came with bread. It did. It tasted pretty good. But then I had to lie on the ground because my stomach cramped up. Fifth visit:Breakfast with friends. I got an okay omelette.Medici on 57th: pretty dope Hyde Park landmark but disappointing foodie destination","This is a lovely cafe on the University of Chicago campus, in the same building as the revered Seminary Co-op bookstore. The coffee and espresso drinks are great, the food is delicious with many menu options, and the space is designed beautifully to showcase the view of Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House next door.On past trips back to the university I've kind of stuck to my old haunts (Plein Air wasn't open yet while I was in college), but this time I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did. My vanilla latté was perfect - not too sweet. I also got a sandwich that was a lunch special - chicken with poblano peppers, avocado, and beans on a French roll. Absolutely delicious. It was a tad messy to eat, but so yummy. The sandwiches also come with a small serving of fresh salad with a simple vinaigrette, which is nice.I enjoyed my sandwich while listening to the fascinating discussions other patrons were having and enjoying the view out the enormous windows. Had this cafe been open when I was a student, I think I would have come to work here quite a bit. It's just a really nice atmosphere and the food and drink offerings are on point and beautifully presented. Next time I'll arrive earlier in the morning and try the intercontinental breakfast!","I like this coffee lounge since my kiddo goes to school right next door. I also work in the area, so if the lines aren't very long I love to come in for a hot cup of dark roasted coffee and a pastry to go. It always smells amazing when you walk in. You aren't always greeted with a big smile but the service is always polite and accurate. The menu is just the right size, I hate large menus since I'm so indecisive, but they cover pretty much all the basics from sandwiches to shakes. The place itself always seems to be clean and organized. The environment is mixed, from folks coming in to have a quick business meeting to those just grabbing a snack while they wait for the bus. It's literally a gem for the Woodlawn area. They also have the little stamp cards, so if you frequent often you can get a free drink! Most small cafes don't offer this, but that's a perk that keeps me coming back. I love the 63rd Turkey Club, don't change a thing about it. I haven't been able to enjoy a lot of other options since I'm a busy mom and always on the go, but I can't wait to try their little breakfast bowl. I hate seeing people tear small business apart on Yelp and other reviews sites. Next time try speaking with the owner or manager first before trying to ""hit them where it hurts"". I'm a native of the Hyde Park/Woodlawn area and have worked over here for years, in restaurants, business offices, you name it! Small business owners are more likely to hear your opinion, even if they don't agree they will always hear you out and address any issues you may have. The owner is a very nice guy. :)"
42,"Two stars, according to Yelp, means ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  That is totally correct for Gallery Cafe.  It is average at best.  Our fair city has MANY awesome coffee places, and Gallery is far from awesome.  I think the problem actually may be the cups ... since our coffee tasted like the dumb cup.Skip Gallery and walk to plenty of other great coffee places in the neighborhood.106/365","The quality of the coffee at Gaslight is nothing to quibble about.  However when it comes down to it, even with the prime location and open windows, it wouldn't be a coffee shop I would come to and try to get some work done.  This is because the chairs, though aesthetically pleasing are generally uncomfortable and you won't want to stay there for longer than an hour.  Still if this isn't something that would bother you, rest assured that between their friendly service and quality coffee, you'd definitely enjoy your brew.","I was looking forward to this opening for a long time. It's a modern, but still warm and beautiful space. I go 4 or 5 times a week in the morning to grab my morning coffee and I have always been happy. Everyone who works there is extremely nice and helpful. The coffee is always amazing, and I especially love mornings when I can stay and they serve my coffee with additional carafe on the side to refill. It may seem a little expensive for coffee, but it reality the time and effort they put into it makes it worth it.","Ipsento's biggest fault, it's proximity to me.  I have learned a little self control since it's opening but still spend 5x more on coffee than I usually do.  My husband literally just ran down to grab us evening lattes.  This is a clean, modern, and in layman's terms, just really cool coffee shop/bar.  You heard right, BAR!  I have popped in a for a few of their cocktails, and, amazing.  I think they rotate both their cocktails and beers but I'm not completely certain.The staff here is always friendly.  They know my name.  At least the morning guys do.  As far as their coffees and lattes go, hands down, the best.  Apparently they have this expensive filtration system and use reverse osmosis water.  If anything go for the water and ambiance.","Was pleased with this bookshop cafe - i liked their book selections. Some of their books are author-signed, and they have different activities scheduled. I could spend a whole afternoon here but was pressed for time so would definitely come back.","This is probably my favorite coffee shop. I love how they decorate the shop in the old fashioned way! I definitely enjoyed playing the Mario game on Nintendo. It brought back the memories I had in the past, I missed playing the game! I had a chai & my boyfriend had dopp something I forgot what it was called. It had peanut butter and dark chocolate in the coffee. He said the peanut butter shouldn't go in the coffee, but it was ok. However, I loved my chai! (Not pictured)","Bagelers is one of my favorite places for a good bagel! They have good coffee AND good bagels, which is a win in my book. (I'm a big fan of the garlic bagels.) Bageler's bagels and coffee are all affordable, and there is a printer available in the cafe. However, beware, they are so popular at certain times of the day there are no seats left, and there is often a decently long line! A hit or miss if you are intending to sit and study. In addition, there is often moderately loud pop music playing in the background, so it may not be the best choice for studying if you don't have headphones or have the ability to tune it out.","This place is too damn delicious for the college student clientele it largely serves. When I was that age, anything other than packaged Ramen noodles or day old Domino's was a total treat so these Blue Demon's are completely spoiled by having this amazing cafe so close to their campus. Excellent sandwiches and salads of which I've had the Great Gatsby and The Sun Also Rises. They're there two best sellers and both are pretty easy to see why with loaded meat, melted cheese and toppings. Served with a fresh pickle spear on the side it's just perfect for lunch, dinner, or in between studies snack. The atmosphere is incredibly chill and can be perfect either an extended session before finals or a first date with a Tinder swipe. Pretty much anything in between would work here as well now that I think about it. Just be sure to bring your wallet cause it's a little bit more expensive than those packed Ramen noodles I referenced before.","Spacious cafe/study spot that just opened late March 2017. Parking can be difficult/expensive around this area since it is near Navy Pier/touristy spots. I got the roast beef sandwich here and it was delicious. Service is fantastic and fast. I like that they have two types of water (still and sparkling) on tap for you to enjoy. If you get a cup of joe, you're allowed up to 1 free refill.Only down side is that this place doesn't have outlets for you to charge your laptops (probably to limit the dwelling times of patrons)..there is one outlet in the entire place so if you're really in need of electricity, you can sit there. By evening, they dim the lights so it gets a little more romantic.It is still new so the place isn't too crowded but I see a lot of potential in this place once the words start spreading.","Any coffee shop that's able to substitute almond milk is a plus in my book. (Nothing against soy, I just don't need an extra dose of plant-based estrogen in the morning.)  Their breakfast sandwiches are killer.","The best almond milk latte I've ever had!! The coffee is really great, and I also loved that the almond milk was sweeter than usual. The atmosphere is also so cute and the staff is super friendly and helpful.","This Intelligentsia location is by the entrance of Manadnock building on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn.  For those who work at the downtown Loop area, this shouldn't be too difficult to find.  However, if you're new or visiting Chicago, ""Dearborn"" is a north-south running road, roughly speaking in between ""State"" and ""Michigan,"" the commercial, touristy street names that most of us are familiar with.  I happened to be in the area this afternoon and wanted to grab a cup of latte to-go before hopping on the Blue Line Train for work.  This place seemed to have enough baristas on duty since people working in the office buildings should be tempting enough to load up some coffee in their useable cups or thermals.  I should bring mine as well to reduce the amount of paper cups we humans use daily.  Obviously the prices on the menu already had tax included.  It doesn't necessarily make it easy for me since the ""numbers"" is really Rosa J.'s middle name.  Surely some of us like to see some integers and view any zero to nine on the right side of decimal as enemies!  I'm not sure if this is a good sit-down coffeeshop, for the business primarily caters to the downtown working professionals.  Leaving the place with a quality cup of coffee to-go then heading to your final destination is always a choice!",The food is awesome! Black owned business too! I've been here twice and I got no complaints.  great music too. Make sure to check out the menue behind the bar to the left it has other drinks that aren't o the menue. Go there ASAP!,,"On Tuesday I saw on Facebook that a new Coffee Shop was opening in Englewood.  Yay.   I shared the info with friends.  Saturday morning I hopped on a southbound RedLine to 69th.  While waiting for a westbound #67 bus I chatted with fellow commuters about how much faster the RedLine is running since the track improvements.I knew the cafe was in the next block when I jumped off at Halsted and 69th.  Instinctively I checked out the north side of the street for 825 W.  Typical northsider mistake because on the south side odd numbers are on the south side of the street.  It's a lovely corner location with exposed brick walls and lots of big windows.There were a lot of people for 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  A fellow patron approached me as I stepped up to place my order and ""paid me forward $2."" A very friendly ice breaker option.  Of course I waited for the next person to pay them forward $2 as well.  I chose a hearty bowl of corn chowder because I was starving so I will have to check out the lattes next time I visit.  I told a friend that one of the sandwich options is a ""Tuna Turner.""  He laughed and suggested that they should offer an ""Ike Tea"" to go with it.Nice place.  Nice people.  Happy to have a landing place when I'm visiting Englewood.","Went here on a Saturday for brunch with my best friend! I ordered the eggs Benedict and she had the the breakfast #2.  My nest friend loved hers as I'm sure anyone who pours a half container of syrup would. (Sigh) As for my Benedict's, and I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of Benedict's as it is my all time favorite breakfast/ brunch dish solely for the hollandaise sauce was cold. My sauce was cold and hand no taste whatsoever. the bacon was cold, the eggs were cold and the muffin was cold. In fact the only thing that was near hot was the potatoes which were delish by the way. Overall I loved my meal I just wish it had come to my table hot and I also wish that my holly actually taste like hollandaise and not just bland tasteless yellow sauce to pour over my Benedict.  Verdict: I would return. Just make it hot next time.",This is by far the best coffee in Hyde Park. Delicious macchiatos and cappuccinos that are smooth and not overly foamy (which can be hard to find in this part of Chicago). All the food that I've tried has been wonderful. Especially their ham and cheese sandwich! Such quality.,This cafe has the worst customer service ever. My daughter purchased something to eat and was told to eat it outside. The employee here along with the owner talks to people as if we're nothing. Thumbs Down
43,"Super cute little coffee shop! Quirky local art, fun music, super nice barista. Great selection of drinks & food. Everything is made fresh & to order. I got a dirty chai - smoothest latte I've had, maybe ever. Not a place to stop in if you're in a rush in the morning - only one person was working & it took a while to get my latte because the customer ahead of me ordered a sandwich. I'll be back on a weekend & see how the food is - it smelled awesome!","I've only tried their teas, and they're ok. I mostly come here to spend hours studying or getting some sort of work done. It's a quiet atmosphere, but it can get kind of packed certain times of the day.",Delicious coffee and super friendly staff. I can't wait to go back for another coffee!!!,"Came here after dinner on girl's night and really liked the vibe. I felt sorry for the server coz we were a bunch of demanding Asian gals who want hot coffee cocktails, but we all liked the drinks so maybe they should think about adding them to the menu for winter! Loved the chill vibe but wish there were more comfy chairs and dessert offerings. Like that they close late. Had a great time and will be back!","I love the idea of a bookstore in a coffee shop, or a coffee shop in a bookstore...I love to explore coffee shops and have been waiting for this spot to open! Finally came here with a girlfriend at 9A--I wish they did open earlier, as much work is needed to be done a little earlier.Workers are super friendly and knowledgable with their inventory for the books! They are fairly new--wish they will have some food items..they have some pastries as of now!Just had their coffee as I needed to get some caffeine in my veins--was really good! Not your ordinary pike place (as an avid Starbucks goer and my to-go-to)! They have beer and wine on the menu--how amazing is that--I will definitely be grabbing some sort of alcoholic beverage as a reward when finishing my work next time I come in!",When I sober I like coffe there but I dont like place too much. Staff its ok When I am drunk I love peaple who work there When I got hangover I hate them lol ... but coffee its amazingWhen I am high ... I realy recommend brown sugar... its amazing,The one star is for yelp. I went to the location given on the map and it was a different coffeehouse that was closed. Yelp said it was open. It was 15 degrees outside so I'm a little frustrated.,"Pretty disappointed with the service and general atmosphere of this cafe. Upon walking in, we were not greeted because the staff was on their phones. I wanted a cafe mocha and was told they were out of chocolate, but they could make me a different kind of latte. I asked for a vanilla latte and they said they were out of vanilla. I settled on a hazelnut latte. After ordering, we tried to find a table, but the only empty tables were covered in trash that the workers didn't clear off. The tables were also put so close together that navigating through the place was a nightmare, and the upstairs area (that I saw cute photos of) wasn't open even though it was busy. Our sandwiches and drinks were fine, but the rude customer service proved to us that we could definitely find better cafes to spend a day off.","I was hoping to find a nice, non-pretentious coffee shop in the River North neighborhood. Unfortunately this is not the place. I came in on a Sunday afternoon, the place was not busy, over half of the tables were open so I opted for a two person table by an outlet (trying not to take up more room than I should). When I went to order, I was greeted with fake smiles and judging eyes, maybe I was under dressed in my Sunday casual ‍. When I was half way through with my meal some (maybe a manager?) came over to me and told me there were designated spots to be on a laptop before 3pm (it was 1:30), and that I chose a table with white writing instead of yellow writing - which denotes the spaces you're ""allowed"" to be on your laptops. That's it. No signs, pictures, or anything I could find at first glance that told me this. Silly me for thinking coffee and a quick bite while trying to lesson plan should be an easy venture. It was not. I can't imagine coming here again. This just in. As I'm writing this, the manager is coming around again to a large table to inform them of the same. This time he had a sign though. It's under the guise of being reserved explicitly for diners... I ordered a full meal. It is clear they care less about keeping paying customers and more about keeping an aesthetically pleasing restaurant. Also, don't order the falafel burger, it is far too salty to enjoy.",This is the best coffee I have had in all of Chicago and the breakfast options are great.  This is a quality place. I really don't get why Americans like Starbucks.,"Dollop Coffee has a lot of charm; I really enjoy both the coffee and the variety of options on the menu.Every time I visit the line is never more than a few people long. The baristas are quick, yet efficient. I've always been impressed with the balance of the drinks. I've tried both the soy latte and the Nutella Mocha.The Nutella Mocha is my favorite! Once I tried it, it became my go-to. It's creamy, smooth, and rich. The sweetness level is actually perfect - you get a little bit of the sweetness from the Nutella, but the coffee and non-sweetened milk balances it out nicely. The cafe always seems full, but I never end up having a hard time finding a seat. This seems to be a favorite study/work spot for a lot of people. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. There are both big and small wooden tables, a couch, and two arm chairs. As other people mentioned previously, the crowd is mixed and there are plenty of outlets. Free Wifi is always a plus.I don't even live in Streeterville and yet I find myself visiting this cafe often. It's definitely worth checking out Dollop Coffee! :)","Loved studying here during my visit to Chicago! The coffee was really rich which took me a little bit to get used to, but in the sense that I was usually used to Starbucks drinks. I got the vanilla latte which wasn't too sweet and was great for the cold day when I visited. The wifi was fast-- but it can slow down when it gets crowded. I got a seat the booth, but you should try to visit early as it gets crowded really fast.","I was looking for a good post-race meal that would be marginally healthy, when Yelp suggested this place near Jackson Park. It's actually in or around Washington Park, but it was only about a 10 minute Divvy-ride, so I went for it.The Divvy station is right across the (six-lane) street, which was pretty convenient; it's also pretty convenient to just get off the Green Line at Garfield. Anyways, I really liked the look of the inside, which I'm guessing took inspiration from a Currency Exchange that used to be on the site? I didn't ask, and I blame that on having just run a half-marathon.I ordered the chilaquiles, in part because I had no idea what they were. It's actually a lot of chips sitting in a jalapeño-tomato sauce, covered in chicken, sour cream, cheese and eggs, which I ordered scrambled. Though I've seriously never been hungover, I suspect this would do quite nicely as a fixer-upper.The flavor was over-the-top good on these. Chips were crispy, salty and flavorful, and the chicken was deliciously marinated in something resembling a distant cousin of jerk sauce. The sour cream went perfectly with fluffy, moist scrambled eggs. And the tomato sauce gave it a good kick to boot.It's a long haul from downtown, but it is worth your time to cash in at the Currency Exchange Café.",,Very nice and lively.  Enjoyed the artistic touch.Nice conference work table in the back.,"I've eaten here quite a few times in the last 4 or 5 years and have never had a disappointing meal! Their menu is diverse, with plenty of options, the service is fast and friendly, and the restaurant itself is lovely in appearance and ambiance (peep the occasionally turning statue high up there).I've eaten so many meals here, but I'll try to remember the very best items I've had. It's been years and I still think about the goat cheese dip in marinara sauce. We loved it so much - we were even dipping our fries in it by the end of the meal. The sandwich with cheese, arugula, and fig spread is also fantastic, though the bread is a bit tough. For breakfast, I love their eggs benedict, and definitely recommend that you ask for your potatoes crispy! This is a wonderful, family friendly restaurant with great service and a menu that could please anyone!","I have a mild love affair with the spinach breakfast pie here. The coffee isn't bad either. Can get very busy, with little elbow room to work","Been coming here a couple of times per month. Really liked it - great coffee choices and interesting and tasty sandwiches. A recent service experience put this place and its people at the top. Was meeting someone to transact some biz. Bought some items including a pound of Blue Heeler coffee. Like a dope I took off without my bag of joe. I came back 10 days later, took a flyer and asked if they had it. Snap snap the young lady retrieves it from the display case with a note on it ""coming back for me"". How great is that?! Small things done right are so uplifting. Thanks Robust."
44,"The creative menu is the best part of this place. Each dish is named after a famous artist: it's quite clever.The coffee was delicious, and the service relatively prompt. However, the food was very mediocre. My breakfast sandwich took way too long for a simple avocado and eggs on french roll. I've gotten better breakfast sandwiches at Einstein Bros. Bagels. Nice place though, good atmosphere.",Definitely one of my favorite coffee shops to grab a cup on my way to work. They're always pretty speedy.,"Nice small modern location. We took a short coffee break here during our shopping. The espresso I ordered tasted strong enough. The crowd was pretty young, and mostly busy on their MacBooks or iPhones. Coffee was served decently fast. If anything it's not really a place to relax and unwind because of the setup and size of this location. But that's ok, we didn't go there to relax, we just wanted a coffee.","Been to so so so so so many coffee shops and cafés all throughout Chicago but i've got to say, Ipsento is my favorite. Really friendly staff, great coffee, open/comfortable space. For some reason I just always feel like i'm most comfortable and productive here.",I really like the whole bookstore + cafe setup. Not as crowded as the Wormhole Cafe next door and a slightly different vibe. Plenty of power outlets to get work done. I don't drink coffee but their hot chocolate was pretty decent.,"A 90's kid haven! What is there not to love about this place! Nintendo and coffee, chill hipster vibes, delorean car display, awesome art, all in the heart of Wicker Park. Yes please! An overall good spot with tasty treats and drinks! Nuff said!","I got the bageler sandwich and the chai tea latte. While the sandwich was amazing, I was a bit disappointed with the chai tea latte. It tasted a bit watery, but was still okay overall. I would eat here again, although I can't say anything about service or atmosphere as i had it delivered.","I've been here several times in the past and always was satisfied. However, we ordered sandwiches to go tonight and were very disappointed. I ordered the ""pilgrims progress"" which is supposed to consist of turkey, cheese, avocado, onion and mayo as a pressed panini. When I got home I realized the sandwich had no onion, minimal avocado and turkey. The quality of ingredients are good but there seemed to be lack of quality in the prep. For a $10 sandwich this was disappointing. Something is off about this place lately...","I stopped in for a coffee and ended up trying the ""Cortado"", which is 2 shots of espresso and an equal amount of steamed milk. It was delicious. It wasn't acidic or harsh at all. I also picked up a mini berry tart, which was delicious. I would definitely come back here. The food looked good too and there were a number of people having meals during my visit.","Great coffee, sandwiches, and pastries...their cortado is excellent.  Solid business.",Pros:Good and friendly service Large selection of flavorful coffeeDecent price Free WiFiCool atmosphere Cons:Busy (hotspot for students)Can get loud and crowded depending on the time/daySeating is not the most comfortable Can get a little cold,"As far as top notch coffee goes, this place when's the award. They were along small farmers and growers to produce exclusive coffee for their stores, which are located in Chicago, L.A., and N.Y. C.. The coffee may only be available for limited times, because they work seasonally with growers to ensure the best quality and fair trade agreements.The coffee is brewed so every note and flavor comes through.  If you're drinking good coffee, sugar shouldn't be necessary because of the fruity, sweet flavors of the bean or cherry coming through to the end of the process.The atmosphere at this cafe is relaxed and friendly. The baristas and roasters do a wonderful job explaining the brand and assisting with questions.","This place is amazing! The vibe is great. It's a small cafe right off the Green Line Garfield stop. It's next to UChicago campus, but not filled with students at all. Service/Ambiance: Everyone is very helpful. The owner is present almost every time we come in. It's very casual. You order at the coffee bar and your food is brought to you. Even though it's casual, the place exudes class and comfort. All and all, you feel at home. The music is a great selection (Frank Ocean, etc.) and not too loud. Laptops are not discouraged. Wifi available. Food:They offer a wide range of comfort food, southern soul food. I'm originally from the South, and the catfish is AMAZING. We ordered the Catfish Po'Boy and the Chicken Sandwich. Both were fried to perfection with a wonderful blend of spices. Value:Both sandwiches were $8.50, but absolutely worth the taste value. Bottom Line:Check it out. Worth going.",,This is a great place to have a cup of coffee and read or study. It has a very homey vibe and the baristas are very welcoming. It's a great place to study with outlets on the couch and free wifi! Their coffee is great! I got a chai tea latte with a shot of espresso and it was really good! I would definitely come back here and make it my go to study spots. They have a small selection of breakfast and lunch as well as pastries which make them an all around cafe. Their prices are very reasonable.,Place is amazing! I can tell why President Obama loved it so. Unique feel and atmosphere the moment you walk in. Great vibes all around. Food is plentiful. Day time Servers always recommend the best dishes! A great little secret to the Hyde Park community. It's definitely worth Checking out!,Subtle but modern coffee shop inside of a bookstore. Enough space to sit down and chat. Very nice and quick service. Had a very soothing and perfect latte with homemade vanilla flavoring. I look forward to going back and trying more items.,Great coffee teas and sandwiches! Chill atmosphere too. Moderate sandwich service speed though.
45,"As both a featured Artist at Gallery Cafe, and a customer I can only find positive things to say about this establishment.  Ive had the pleasure of not only getting to know one of the owners, Eugene (who was incredibly warm and professional), but I've also had the supreme pleasure of enjoying their hot chai tea lattes on many a cold Chicago day. Both experiences were wonderful, especially while being surrounded by the beautiful work by local artists, and cozy atmosphere. Great place to read and enjoy a latte, or grab lunch with a friend. And you don't want to miss their monthly ""Meet and Greet"" with the shown artists. Definitely a favorite Chicago spot.","Stumbled here instead of walking to intelligentsia and fell in love. Calm welcome, great area to get some work done. No problem with the internet (pw: tacotuesdays) and nice hipster decorations and magazines around if you need a little break. Coffee and croissants are really tasty; they can warm up the pastries if you ask. Coffee grinder in the back, feels pretty old school yet modern. I love it! (I'd live here tbh)","I like the people who work at this location, as they're always friendly. However, $4 for a decent 6oz  cappuccino is outrageous. You can find better coffee for cheaper elsewhere in the neighborhood.","One of my favorite coffee shops in the city! Really great location, directly off the 606 Trail. Very chill environment. Good size shop, with adequate space. I haven't been too creative with my drink orders but do enjoy their iced coffee and toasted everything bagels (Very fresh!)","Love this place! Tasty drinks, wonderful staff, and a great selection of books. Can't wait to go back for their book club events!","Loved the 80s nostalgia, the atmosphere was fun.Coffee was okay. Not my favorite. I had the troopa and I didn't like it, hubby had a vanilla latte and it was good","I'm not sure if I've been to a coffee shop so pleasurable! The staff was super friendly and very genuine. Their latte was smooth and tasted like the almond milk was toasted, which was a nice flavor. I had an everything bagel with cream cheese, and it was worth every calorie! The everything bagel had the perfect ratios of seasonings and was soft, chewy, and warm. The cream cheese was SUPER creamy and flavored perfectly--not too cheesy, not too bland. As far as the vibe of the place goes, it has a homey-feel, is relatively quiet (depending on the customers there), and has a wonderful mellow playlist with some older hits playing in the  background. Perfect place to study since they have wifi. 10/10 would recommend and will be back!","Great sandwich if you're willing to wait 45 minutes. We were one of the only tables in the joint on a Sunday and waited 45-60 minutes for two Great Gatsby's. While the sandwhich was amazing, the wait was lengthy. Be prepared for a long wait. Very slow service. Nice outdoor seating. Chip selection is slacking.",Really wanted to like this place. Understaffed with unclear instructions on how to be served or where to sit. You order upfront and seat yourself. The hostess is often cleaning tables and can't seat you.Food was very underwhelming. Good at price point but food was dry and otherwise tasteless.Disappointing but the location is by the river and the lake. Kanela is across the street.,"Was pleasantly surprised to see a new location, having previously visited Dearborn location long back when I worked more near to that particular area but NOW, there is a place near my work on Monroe! Coffee is always great, and the staff are always very friendly and cool.  Although there are a lot of coffee shops competing for the Morning Loop Crowd, and choices abound, this is a great place for real coffee lovers.  One small critique though: they have a good food menu but perhaps owing to their signage and name, it might not always be obvious to passerby that they are more than just coffee.","I went in about 11am today. Two female workers. I ordered a sandwich. The girl who took my order and rang it up was so unfriendly and no thank you at all. I was just standing around and I noticed the other girl toasting the bread. I asked them not to toast it. They seemed annoyed at my very presence much less asking for my almost $10 sandwich to be made the way I want it. I got it to go. When I ate it a little while later the bread was so stale I now know why they want to toast the bread. Who's the manager/owner of this place? You should teach your employees customer service and check the food to make sure it's fit to serve.There is another coffee spot near by on Illinois street called ""Cupitol Coffee and Eatery"" and a Starbuck's on Ontario street close by. I will go anywhere but here next time.","It took me four years of college until I finally got to Intelligentsia. To be honest I didn't want to go. I always pictured Intelligentsia as snobby because I know of a couple places in Indy that serve it and I thought ""hey now, why not serve an Indy roaster you uppity poots""Maybe these folks in Indy just know good coffee because this was GOOD coffee. The cold brew was so smooth that it could have played a mean saxophone solo. The loose leaf tea came in an awesome cup that warmed your hands and your heart. There was ample seating, good lighting, and opportunity to Instagram (follow djeccles for my adventures) with Popular Pays for a free coffee. I wish I would have gotten over my Intelligentsia fears and had this earlier. Don't make the same mistakes I did my friend.","So this is a really cool place! I mean the decor and the atmosphere are awesome. Also, I had the salted caramel almond latte, which was sooooo good. As for the food, I honestly just thought it was average, so I can't give more than 3 stars. The prices were reasonable to me. I think one pancake was $3.50, 2 strips of bacon were $3.00, latte was $4.00, the grits were probably between $3-$4. The pancake tasted average, the biscuit was also average. The grits were a little too thick for me......kinda reminded me of when I make instant grits and don't use enough water, that could just be my preference. The bacon was actually good. Also, everyone who works here seemed really friendly and nice!I would go back for the coffee or just to hangout, but I don't know about the food. Nothing was terrible, it just wasn't above average. Maybe it was an off day? I really don't know.",,"A coffee oasis in a desert of Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts! Mellow and welcoming vibe, industrial decor, great place to relax with a latte. Took the recommendation of another yelper and was not disappointed: the Mos Def sandwich was super yummy. Also, appreciated the books for kids on he bookshelf so our 5 and 3 year old could be occupied while we enjoyed the excellent latte. Thank you!","Old neighborhood staple.. I grew up in Hyde Patk so I have been coming here off and on for years. The food is average.. it's mostly frequented by the locals and students from the nearby University. The pizzas are decent... Today I had a BLT with avocado nothing special, but hard to mess up too.","Terrible customer service. When I was given the wrong drink and had to return to the cafe, I was told I would have to wait until there were no other customers until my drink would be remade. I was also told that taking the drink was my fault and that if I wanted my drink sooner that I would have to tell everyone in line that I was inconveniencing them because of my mistake. When I said that was poor customer service, I was told to take it up with management, but the barista could not produce a manager or management's contact information.  Have never experienced customer service this poor.",I'm angry it took me so long to find out about this place! I had the breakfast bowl which was fresh and delicious. The vibe is very inviting and chic all while still being authentic to the neighborhood. I really enjoyed my breakfast and will def be back for dinner!
46,"I absolutely LOVE this place! I work down the street, and spend almost 90% of my mornings stumbling into this place for a latte. All of the staff is friendly, knowledgable about coffee (that matters), and they are more than willing to go the extra mile to ensure your beverage, sandwich, or pastry is satisfactory. One time the manager went down the basement to grab me a drink holder for two coffees. I am shocked this place has such a poor rating on Yelp. Drink prices are on par with, if not cheaper than, a certain chain coffee shop located at Milwaukee/Damen/North and it makes me happy knowing my money is going to a local business owner. Furthermore, the food is DELICIOUS and the sandwiches are all prepared fresh before your eyes and served with chips. Local art is for sale on the wall and free WIFI is accessible. This is definitely a place in the neighborhood to support.",I'm torn on the rating ... The coffee and canele here is definitely a 4 star quality but the service was unfortunate.  The barista had an edge of contempt in her voice and really had no interest in serving anyone that morning.Honestly ... The coffee was very good compared to Bowtruss and far better than Intelligentsia up the street.  It was flavorful with a natural note of cocoa and the acidity was low so you didn't that the bitter note most people complain about dark roast.  The canele had the perfect crust with a nice eggy custard middle.  I would be so happy with this choice if it wasn't for the eye rolls by the barista.If she was just neutral in her expression... Easily a 4 star experience.,Thanks to Matt for the awesome pick me up this morning! I'm here a few times a week and the coffee is always delicious and the faces always friendly. You guys just made a loyal customer today. Thank you!,"The good:The coffee here is tasty.  The ingredients, flavor notes, and presentation is on point.  The not so good:After 3 pm, however, they begin to limit the coffee offering which is a bit inconvenient for late afternoon coffee drinkers.The bad:The service could use a revamp.  We sat counter side for a while and no one came to greet us or remove the previous guest's glasses.  Finally, I got up and went in line at the register.  I asked for a menu and the guy behind the counter plopped one at my seat at the counter (and still left the dirty glasses).  Finally after being ignored for another 10 minutes, I got up and ordered from the cash register.  I did ask if we normally have to order from the register and the guy said no but since I'm at the register he'll take my order.  None of the employees seemed happy to be there.Although the coffee here is good, it is not better than any of a dozen other local coffee shops in the area that serves delicious coffee by baristas with better attitudes.","I stop in here whenever I'm in Wicker Park and it's a favorite stop of mine. The book selection is curated carefully and I've found many gems and authors I would have normally not known about. There are little recommendation notes all over (The mark of a well-read staff that enjoys helping indecisive people like me).The coffee and drinks are really good, the space is open, clean and bright. They do some really cool events here--bookclubs, open mics and such. I caught the preview of an Opera showing here once which was awesome. My only complaint is that every time I'm in here I spend way more money then I intended to (On me, not them!) I have to say that I've grown into a voracious reader because of it and Volumes is always worth it.","Easily top 3 best coffee shops in Chi. I've given less than 10 Five star ratings on Yelp. Coffee shops around the country should take note. This is what A game looks like:- creativity designed decor: homage to old school films like Back to the Future - probably the friendliest, happiest, and quirkiest team- the specialty lattes are actually balanced with the right flavor profile and balance without losing the essence of a latte. Most places stick bunch of random ingredients together that sound good on paper but betray their coffee essence and taste horrid. See how it's done - get the Honey Bear or the curry latte.","First visit:Perfect music at perfect volume, a first so far in Chicago. Greeted and made welcome, clean tables, two beautiful smiles behind the counter, excellent service, fantastic bagel and toasted properly and just the right amount of topping, AND, the bagel was quartered for ease of eating. Excellent latte, nice and hot as requested, wonderful flavour. I shall definitely be returning!!Thank you ladies!!",Really good joint. Delicious food beautiful atmosphere. Came here on a whim with some friends and was throughouly impressed,"Pros:- It's decorated beautifully!- Spacious and wide enough so that you don't overhear every conversation- There are comfy sofa chairs to lounge on, but also tables and chairs too- Coffee and tea are both great!- The tiramisu cake slice was spot onCons:- None I can think of at the moment","great bright coffee shop perfect for a quick cup or an all day work a thon. coffee is good, food is nice and the service is always with a smile. try their pour over coffee, is great and not something you can get everywhere.","I am a bit conflicted about this place. We stopped by as we needed a quick coffee in the morning. Partner got the cortado with coconut milk and it fell flat. Nothing remarkable. Just basic. I got the Mexican latte with three chili, which I thought was great but slightly too heavy on the cinnamon. I don't think the barista enjoyed her job; she had the most apathetic affect during our brief interaction. When ordering, I neglected to correct her when she said ""Mexican latte with almond milk."" I am unsure where she got the almond milk from because I never asked for the substitution, but it was my fault for not correcting her. I am also unsure if the replacement made the latte feel less rich .. regardless, it was a nice drink but not enough to cause me to return. I would much rather drink Jacques Torres' wicked hot chocolate. Would I recommend? Sure if you're in the neighborhood but there's nothing extraordinary. Ambience is a standard coffee shop - lots of people from Northwestern having meetings here, students working on their computers, etc. I guess it's chilled  from the vibes of its patrons, but their barista was unwelcoming.","A cozy coffee shop near the bean/michigan ave.I came in just to get a coffee in the morning. However, their foods look awesome! They have a great selection of pastries and drinks.Love the place, and the people!I am pretty sure i will come back!","Less than expected experience. The ordering system is more like carry out. You order food and drinks at counter and pay before you pick a table for dine in. We picked a table which hadn't been cleaned from the prior guest. We made a ""waitress"" aware and it still took a while to get cleaned. When our drinks were ready, we had to fetch them from the counter. When food arrives we were made aware that we should have gotten our own silverware at the counter as well. I just don't understand or like the process. I wanted more food and drinks but I didn't want to get back in line to do so. The food was ok. The only saving grace for a star was my ""Coco Loco"" (cold brew, coconut and almond milk). It was divine! I don't see me making another trip from Joliet for it though. Also I left a generous tip that I wouldn't have had I known what I know now.",,"An Englewood Gem! Outstanding service and great ambiance. I've tried almost all of the hot drinks and all were great. Great prices and way better drinks than Starbucks (which I do patronize often). Fresh pastries and breakfast sandwiches served as well. Cold pressed juices were phenomenal. If you're in the neighborhood you must stop by, or make a special trip and see for yourself.","We lived in Hyde Park for a decade and this was definitely one of our favorite local eateries. ""The Med"" has a long history in Hyde Park. The atmosphere is very fun, with graffiti all over the walls and tables as well as some cool original art (including pieces by Matisse and other renowned artists). The food is fairly standard American fair, but a couple of items are exceptional, especially their milk shakes. My favorites are the Mocha and the Banana Nut Fudge. They also have a great Cobb salad and decent brunch options. In the summer, they open their second floor patio, which is one of the only quite outdoor seating areas in the neighborhood. Just before we left, they also got their liquor license, and they now have a great selection of craft beers. We're missing having this restaurant as a nearby place to walk to now that we're no longer in the neighborhood.","A great little cafe and only a short walk from the Harper Center. I visited here in July when classes are out of session and there were few vacancies both inside and outside. I can only imagine how popular this place is during school year. From the interior, I really liked their minimalist design and communal tables to make good use of space. We sat outside as the weather was perfect. The shades of tree and the overall enclosure made it a great spot for staying cool and away from the foot traffic on the street. Unfortunately, my visit was short so I can't comment on their breakfast and lunch menu, but I highly recommend here if you are looking to grab a personalized cup of coffee (yes, come with latte art !!). I did notice that they have drip coffee as well.","Good coffee and a decent place to work or meet. I think they would have decent food based on the coffee and what things looked like, but I didn't try anything. Definitely next time I'm down there."
47,"Stopped by to grab a quick early morning coffee before heading to Damen North Dental across the street. Even though getting coffee before seeing the dentist is counter intuitive, I'm going to make this a regular pre-dentist stop. The service was quick and the seating was plenty. The place is a little divey so I'm not sure if I would trust the food but the coffee was excellent.",If you know me you know that Brothers K iced coffee is my nirvana. I was surprised to find another place with OUTSTANDING iced coffee...it was so good at the Gaslight!,"Coffee was decent though strong, cappucino was good. Vibe was a little standoff-ish, like trying too hard to be cool. Not a lot of seating and most of it was taken up by people camped out with computers. Overall, an ok experience but a bit over-hyped.","The beautiful esthetics, the wonderful staff and the excellent coffee makes ipsento a MUST try! One of my favorite coffee spots","The name says it all. Nice morning cup of Joe or an afternoon beer with a good read. Up to date books with a nice selection. Fun reviews from the staff on all different categories and guest appearances from authors. This isn't you're grandmas book store. Clean, comfortable, and chill environment. Check it","Excellent coffee - I can't remember what they use. It's quality stuff. Maybe a wee bit overpriced for Chicago, but whatevs.I used to go here when I was unemployed (*sobs*) and during the day there was almost always table seating. My roommate said weekends are awful, though, so I don't bother. It's also a little dark inside for my liking.Overall, great coffee and a decent workspace.","My new go to bagel shop! My friend and I were looking for a light breakfast to start our day and we were going to go to a popular bagel spot by the Red Line Belmont but decided to try something new and no regrets. I wish I had something this cute in my college days cause this would have been a prime study spot. The bagel choices were really simple, either a lox or a breakfast bagel and then your basic spreads with bagels. The tea selection was impressive. I normally am not a tea person but their tea latte options got me since I was thinking it'd be like a milk tea. Got the litchi noir latte! It wasn't exactly like a milk tea but twas good. It came unsweetened so I added 3 packets of sugar on the raw and 5 squirts of simple syrup.. the amount of sugar I need to sweeten my drinks kinda scare me.. but #donowregretlater I guess.Friend & I got:Bageler on everything bagelBageler on a croissant (though it came out on a sea salt bagel due to misentering from the cashier)Passionfruit green teaLitchi Noir LatteWould come back for my bagel needs!","When I visited: 5.24.16What I got: 12 oz drip, cafe florio blendDrink Review: A darker blend with notes of peach and apricots. Served in a plain white, medium, white paper cup, the drink was unassuming. Getting into the actual drink it was a very smooth dark roast with only a small aftertaste of bitterness. Overall, very drinkable and great for settling in and either getting down to work or fully relaxing on a lazy afternoon. Cafe Review: 'Cafe' is a bit of an understatement here. The bourgeois pig boasts a large location off Lincoln and Fullerton, with ample seating outside in their front courtyard and additional seating upstairs beyond the initial cafe. Note, there is a restaurant in the building but in a separate room/space adjacent so since you can't seamlessly walk through it to the cafe I'll be omitting it from this review. The overall aesthetic is antique, old wood and old world style. This is the kind of spot you'd expect out of a Hemingway novel, with swing music playing like in a Portillo's. The cafe walls are a combination of old exposed brick and an interesting textured siding I am not familiar with. The whole building isn't just for show either; the whole thing is ""Old Chicago"" down to the foundation (built in 1893) as evidenced by its sneaky supply cellar adjacent to the rather old bathroom set up. (Be aware: the entrance does require numerous stone steps, so beware if stairs don't bode well for you). I for one definitely recommend the second floor of the cafe for those looking for a quieter nook to read, work, or have a more intimate, quiet conversation. Overall, the coffee is solid but not the main focus as the atmosphere of the spot is really the key attraction. Think of a university reading room meets a swing era coffee/sandwich spot. Overall Visit Rating: 8/10",I usually patron Cupitol in Evanston and was super excited to see another one close to my hotel during a mini staycation. The one downtown does not have a bakery and is actually smaller. We tried to get a table but a table for a party of five would have took forever. Waited 30 mins. for take out after being told it would take only 15 mins. Literally walked down the street back to our hotel and the food was ice cold. We had pancakes in our order but was only given jam. Spent $74 bucks on everything and it was mediocre. I and my party was very unhappy but ate because we were starving after waiting so long.,"This place is the best! Lattes are always well-made, pastries are fresh, and service is fast and friendly. It's a beautiful new shop with a great atmosphere. I had a large skim latte and an almond croissant, and both were delicious! I would recommend Dollop to any tourists stopping by the bean or the Art Institute as a nice, more local alternative, and also to anyone who works in the area and wants a new regular coffee spot.","Nothing special, nothing bad. Just an average cute little shop to drop by while waiting for a nearby brunch reservation. Not a coffee shop I would go to get some work done tho, moreso a catch-up or to go spot. The lines can be a little long but I went on Sunday morning so not sure what it'd be like on the weekday. Just on the street parking so you may have to drive around to find someplace to park.","I LOVE Intelligentsia coffee, so I was very excited to visit their cafes on my recent Chicago trip. This location is a real looker, with marbled counters and tiled floors, and its street side location in the historic Monadnock Building. The baristas are as dapper as can be with their bowties and Newsie's caps. Necessary? No, but it's an aesthetically pleasing touch to this already classy place.We lingered a bit to get charged up for a long visit to the Art Institute, and enjoyed the buzz of the place. The Paris bombings had happened a day or two before, and there was a community feeling with people getting together, discussing current events in French and English, and surprisingly not a lot of people tippy tapping on their computers or tablets. Can't go wrong with any of their drinks. I had a classic chai, which was a warm treat on a windy day. I almost filled my suitcase with bags of beans, but bought just one, their Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, whose light and floral notes make me happy. Would I have to choose just one Intelligentsia location to patronize, this would be it. So much to enjoy just steps away, but a caffeinated oasis and shelter from the wind inside.","i love the space at currency exchange. im a big fan of plants, natural light, booth seating, and tiles, and currency exchange hits all the marks! i also think they play great tunes to work to and overall, the ambient environment is perfect for catching up with a friend or getting some studying done. i love how they have good bottomless coffee for three dollars and really enjoyed how accommodating they were as they warmed up my bread pudding muffin upon request. prices are a little steep, but i feel like im paying more for the ambience rather than the food itself. the muffin, although tasty, was pretty dry even when it was heated up, but still tasty and full of chocolate. i will say though that the breakfast potatoes were OUT OF THIS WORLD: flavorful, crispy, and reasonably priced for the amount that you get. i think if i were to come back, i'd just get a drink, maybe the breakfast potatoes, and do some work, but overall, pretty fantastic cafe!",,"Nice addition to neighborhood. Coffees have great flavor- smooth without bitter aftertaste. They also have smoothies, sandwiches, salads and breakfast options. They also have yoga on Monday evenings and host a variety of other community events including poetry readings, storytelling and music performances. Love the pay it forward option.","This by far is my favorite place to have breakfast while in Chicago! Their breakfast is amazing, I'll be dreaming about it from California. Their muffins are so good, I don't even have words to describe how amazing they taste.","This place is aesthetically pleasing and the drinks are pretty good. I got two eggs any style and was not very impressed by the taste or the portion--just very mediocre for the price. However I ordered the chai latte and that was reallllllly good. Just the perfect amount of spice and creaminess and foamed milk that I LOVE in a chai latte. And the price for it was much more worth than its Starbucks counterpart. Basically, go there to have a coffee chat but not to eat a meal!",LOVE THIS PLACE! Food is great....Coffee is even better. It's a great place to have a small meeting or come and catch up on reading/work. I have had the tuna melt and several breakfast sandwiches (it's an addiction ). The staff is friendly and it's clean.
48,"I live right around the corner from Gallery Cafe and decided to give this place a shot.  Their coffee is amazing, one of the best I've had.  I decided to try one of their breakfast sandwiches one day and ordered the DaVinci.  Pure bliss.  I ordered it with turkey sausage, pepperjack cheese, and tomato bread. Their wifi is reliable and fast.  They have plenty of tables and outlets for you to work on, and if coffee refills are only .50! I could stay there all day and work, it's a nice cozy setting and the staff never pressures you to leave.  They mind their own business and let you do yo thang!Only reason I gave it a 5 star is because it's a little too hipster for me, but it's all good in the hood.",Excellent quality coffee beans from around the world expertly roasted to release their up most aroma and flavor. Every bag of coffee purchased comes with a complementary shot of perfectly pulled espresso. A great addition to the city of Chicago. The atmosphere is relaxing and friendly to those looking to open up their laptop to work while enjoying their favorite esspresso drink.,"Top notch coffee, friendly baristas and an urban atmosphere. The pastries (had the croissant) were excellent as well. Flaky with generous fillings. TIP: If you buy a bag of coffee, they knock $3 off your cup of coffee. Whole Foods also sells Intellgentsia coffee, but the shop has more variety.","Visit at night, grab a drink at the bar, and sit by the open windows for some fantastic wildlife watching!","I wanted to love this place so much, and join their book clubs, and support them...But... overpriced lousy drinks, awful parking, and rude staff will make my first visit yesterday my last.","Had a cold brew Yerba mate with ginger and lime drink that tasted nothing like mate, but was still okay. The music they were playing, however, was terrible and made me have visions about entering the gates of Hell.","Great place to do some work and offers anything you would ask of a coffee shop. Apparently they serve lunch too though I haven't ventured there.One complaint is that while tasty, our hot drinks were not nearly hot enough. Don't know if this can be addressed with technique or appliances.","This place was so cool. It's set in an old house, so you can go to different rooms and go upstairs for unique decor and seating. Also a nice patio space. Good sandwiches and coffee.","Simply the best breakfast place I have been to in a while. Felt like the cool kid again. Great space, great vibe and great food and coffee. Even with kids. Only one bit of critique if your going tell me, you will bring my coffee my shortly then its good if it happens 20min later. The coffee was for my wife. When I went to pick up my drink order for myself and my kids my wife's drink order was not ready yet. Just I sat down I told my wife we better go get hers as I have feeling they will only bring it 20min later. That is exalted what happened.","Wow, I just had a wonderful lunchtime sandwich.  Well made a fresh ingredients.  Yummy and the staff was really helpful.","I stopped in today with a friend for the first time and had a turkey sandwich and a Nutella mocha. While I enjoyed both the sandwich and the beverage, I will not return to this location due to the poor customer service. The cashier was cold and rude to me when I asked her for skim milk. Instead of saying that she didn't hear what I was saying, she responded by rolling her eyes at me, shaking her head, and stated ""WHAT? We don't have that!"" Finding it difficult to believe that a coffee establishment doesn't have skim milk; I repeated the request, which her coworker heard from further away, and jumped in to assist. No apology was offered, and in fact, I gave her an apology for making her so upset. There were no lids stocked to fit my medium sized cup, there were no forks in the utensil holders, and the garbages were overflowing. I loved the atmosphere and product offerings, but I'll take my business somewhere that treats customers with a bit more respect.","I love everything about this place except its location...need to pick this up and move it along the route of my regular commute.  Great Art Deco lighting, white marble tables, and the baristas here are artists.  I have yet to come across a better cappuccino in Chicago.  This place makes me long to be called again for jury duty...","Good food, excellent coffee, and a comfortable relaxed atmosphere we will definitely be going back.",,"Love this little cafe.  Sandwiches are delicious, I will be visiting here on a regular basis.  Only issue is there is only street parking and there are no other options besides sandwiches and wraps.  The day old donuts are even delicious.  Glad to see a black owned business in this neighborhood that's not rundown or a liquor store","I think former president Obama ate here?This is a pretty decent cafe, with pretty typical cafe options - burgers, sandwiches and personal pizzas.  I really like the personal pizzas - the garbage pizza (i.e. the meat lovers pizza) is simple, tasty and packed with meat.  My wife had the spinach goat cheese pizza which was tasty too.  The pizzas take a little bit of time to make but the restaurant is all and all pretty efficient.  I also tried a smoky joe wrap - which was fine, but just.. not that exciting.  I would come here for the pizzas.","This was the first wave of those restaurants with the industrial metal decor and wood benches and rustic coffee equipment and succulent plant decor and that classic multi-grain, locally grown, organic, vegan, humanitarian food. The Balti bowl is excellent; everything else is over-priced.",Never. Ever. Coming back here. Since i cant delete. Here. 5 stars. My review is too short and yelp want to make it a tip to others.
49,"Pretty cool place. They roast the beans in house so the coffee is good and the sandwiches are a total treat. No dogs allowed inside but there are dog treats by the door, cute. #localart","Pretty cool spacious place. There sign from the outside looks very similar to Starbucks, weird!!!! I tried the Congo pour over using Chemex( suggested by the barista)and it was below average. Disappointing. The cinnamon morning roll was decent. Overall:Atmosphere: 9Service: 8Coffee: 4Meh! Nothing special.... Not worth it.",Some of the best chai lattes in Chicago. My only wish is that they had a cinnamon shaker to add some on the top of the foam. Other than that perfect. Great pastries and rad seating.,"The hip knick-knack store next to Ipsento 606 has a card that says, ""We Used To Be Cool."" That's how I feel when I come to Ipsento 606.Look -- they serve beer here, too. How cool is that? The windows open up to the lawn outside, where all these young folks hang out and read their Bestseller books. How cool is that? You can tie up your dog outside and watch as strangers stop-by to admire your pup. How cool is that? It's basically in the best spot right now in a 3 mile radius -- right off the 606, on Damen. Doesn't get any cooler than that.But now let me knock it down so I can feel better about myself. It's not a great place to study/work since it's so busy all the time. Lots of constant activity. It can get a bit warm due to the windows/wall being open. Space can be hard to come by. I sound pretty uncool criticizing this coffeeshop so I'll stop now.","Super cute place. The lighting and decor is very open. There are tables and outlets all along the wall making it a perfect study or work space. I came for a Women's open Mic night. It felt like a very open, safe space environment and really had a good laugh! Solid cafe drinks.",Very cool place. It has a back to the future feel to it. I had a lavender and mint latte and it was super good. The flavor was awesome. No need for any sugar which is rare for me. The pastry selection is very nice.,Soooo good. I reccomend this place. Good begals.,"Great little cafe! I got the spinach quiche and that hit the spot! My fiancé got the Great Gatsby sandwich and it was just perfect! there's seating outside but watch out for the bees! Overall, I would go there again when in the area. Gives a little hint of Italy to its decor!","Third time visiting this establishment and it seems to be getting worse and worse. Upon my arrival I was asked if I was using a kindle or laptop to determine where I was going to be placed. My previous visits I was able to sit where I wanted without any issues, so this was an aspect that I wasn't too fond of considering I was there to read while I enjoyed my meal. I proceeded to order a Matcha Latte and Sweet Potato Bowl. I had to wait over 15 mins for my drink as it was over looked and secondly after receiving my drink I come to find out my drink was a cup of milk with a hint of color.  My beverage did not taste at all of Matcha which I requested a new one as the one i had had no flavor. New Matcha served wasn't made well as I could taste the Matcha powder as I drank the beverage.Now to the meal, unfortunately I was not at all wow'd at the food. Food was average at best. Certain areas of my food were really hot and in my opinion appeared to be microwaved. Additionally my meal was saturated in the curry sauce with an appearance of baby food than a risotto.  Unfortunately I will take my business elsewhere.  Had high hopes entering and enjoyed the ambiance but that won't make up for the meal and service I received.  Kanela is right across the street if you're looking for a more edible and service friendly meal.",I am giving 3 stars for the coffee. The sausage biscuit wasn't that great for the price they had it at,"Great place to have breakfast at the Ohio street.  With very few vegetarian options being the downside, we went for a veggie sandwich, a brown sugar almond cake, and Cortado. The sandwich tasted good and fresh. However, it had an unusually large piece of red pepper. But the rest of the veggies came together very nicely with the bread. Muffin was great. Not very sweet - just right. Cortado, however, wasn't so great as we have had better ones before.The place is quite busy in general but not so much of wait compared to other known places for breakfast in the vicinity. The staff is quite friendly and quick on service. Seating can be improved as most of the seating here is high chairs. Overall, a good and less crowded place to have a decent breakfast.",A delightful cup of Joe and a cool place to hang out. I wish I discovered this place on day 1 of my trip to Chicago.,"I can't say enough good things about this place. Excellent food, great atmosphere and good music. The catfish and grits and the lunch soul bowl are my favorites. The food is absolutely delicious, the staff is warm and friendly and they don't hound you to get up the second you're done with your food. I love this place!",,"I appreciate this place for being bold enough to be located in such community!! I did a counseling session here, that's how nice it is! I'll be back!;)",The strawberry shake is the only thing I can review.  It is one of my favorite shakes.  I want to try the pastries specifically the spinach & feta but they are always sold out when I arrive.,"I love how tucked away this little cafe is. The space is charming and the food is high quality. The last time I was there service was a bit chaotic, but they made up for making mistakes on our order by giving us extra food. It is nice to take a walk around the University of Chicago when you are done with your breakfast.","I come here a LOT because of its proximity to my workplace--sometimes on the clock and sometimes not, depending. In the 25 or so times that I've been to Robust, I've tried a LOT of the menu and I have also had a lot of different interactions with different staff. I have not had a particularly consistent experience here, which is why I have held off on a review. I've had some five-star customer service experiences and some two-star customer dr vide experiences. I've had some five-star food and some two-star food. I'm going to focus instead on my overall experience, including the sum of 25 visits to Robust. Overall, Robust is an excellent addition to the Woodlawn community. It's located conveniently right on the corner and it's a meeting place for lifelong residents of the community, as well as University of Chicago staff and students who want to venture a little off the beaten path off campus. Uniform-clad school children can frequently be found here enjoying a snack or beverage after school hours. The diversity of customers at Robust is great and adds to the welcoming atmosphere.The service can be hit or miss. Some of the staff are incredibly kind, patient, and friendly, while others are fairly negligent and inattenive. My orders are messed up maybe 35% of the time, which is not the best. I have had my order forgotten more than a few times. Sometimes, the staff are really apologetic and offer to give me extra flavor or a bigger size to compensate. Sometimes, they barely bat an eyelash. I've tried maybe half of the menu items, including blended drinks like the oreo madness, smoothies like the almond milk, banana, chai, food items like the grilled cheese and hummus platter, the mocha diablo, pumpkin spice latte, gingerbread latte, etc. So, why the four-star rating? At the end of the day, I know I can count on Robust to be a cozy haven--a true gem in Woodlawn. Robust has a great atmosphere, acceptable drinks/food/prices, and (most importantly, for me) seating, outlets, and wifi. Seriously, I have never not been able to find a seat or outlet here and that is the most important thing! I will continue to be a happy customer at Robust as long as I work in Woodlawn."
