There are many coffee options including drips, pour-overs and an Impressive tea collection as well.I had a drip coffee which was bold enough, though I still haven't had my fantasy dark, bold, non-acidic, not too bright coffee in Chicago.My wife had the green jasmine tea which compared to the one she had yesterday which had a more jasmine/floral presence, this one was heavy on the green and not so much on the jasmine / floral. She remarked she could have just ordered a ""green tea"".They have Vegetarian quiche available (which excite me) along with a veggie dandwich, and a Brie Sandwich with fig jam (also enticing to me a s vegetarian), but with biscuits on the menu, that's automatically the direction I default to. I had the egg and cheddar biscuit. I asked if they could make it with egg whites and they said ""no"", they get the eggs this way so it was a bit disappointing to me to learn the food was essentially not made to order. It also tasted a bit-reheated which is kind of obvious to tell with biscuits. It was also too hot when I received it...the cheddar cheese on it was over-melted and didn't have much of a taste. It tasted like I was getting biscuit and egg. Cheddar on a biscuit should be not quite so melted so the cheddar flavor shines through.I'd give the place another try if I'm back in Chicago...but with so many options downtown it wouldn't be top on the go-to list.",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I judge every coffee shop by their almond milk cappuccino.  If you don't offer almond milk, I won't even order, so props to Dollop for carrying it.  I also appreciated the fact that they have Harmless Harvest Coconut Water and Rx Bars.  However, that's where my positive experience ends.  My medium cappuccino was almost $6 and it tasted bitter.  It was reminiscent of Starbucks bitterness, which I can't stand. It also had almost no froth.  (I realize it's more difficult to froth almond milk but I assure you it can be done - Rom does it perfectly).  I am afraid Dollop is 1 and done for me.",5 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I was excited since I've seen good reviews at other locations. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. The menu has a lot of great options for both hot and cold coffee and tea options. I saw that almond milk was an option ($0.60 charge), so I decided on a 12 oz. cappuccino. I really like coffee so I prefer a 1/2 coffee, 1/2 milk cappuccino. I know that's not normally an option. Most places do 2/3 milk, 1/3 coffee, and that's fine. I watched the girl behind the counter make mine. She poured about 8 oz  of milk out and steamed it. Then she brewed one shot of espresso and put it in.. So I paid almost $5 (tax included) for a glass of frothy milk with a tinge of coffee taste. My coworker order a 12 oz iced americano. The same thing. We saw them fill the glass with ice and water, almost to the top and then added 1 shot of espresso. It was so weak, another coworker thought she was drinking iced tea. While I was waiting for my drink, one of the guys behind me ordered a regular 16 oz coffee. They poured a cup with about 12 oz of coffee in it. He was rightfully upset and asked that if he is going to pay for 16 oz, he expects to get them. It's similar pricing to any other coffee shop you might find in the Loop, but I did not get what I paid for.",6 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
