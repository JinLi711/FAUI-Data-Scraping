The shrimp were large and perfectly cooked where they were still succulent and popping with flavor. I ordered the peach bourbon French toast which was very tasty, but those grits stole the show.  I ended up getting my French toast to go and shared grits and truffle fries with my niece.The fries came with a delicious spicy creole sauce that would be perfect on salmon croquettes (getting on my next visit) and that had some amazing banana ketchup.The chef actually came out and talked to us about how they infuse the ketchup with bananas which was cool for my niece to hear and have more appreciation for our dining experience.  We experienced friendly service, OMG delicious food at a decent price for fresh quality food.

The staff are wonderful. The place is beautiful. I love rustic look. It has two levels. You're able to eat at bar, booth and great seated table throughout.

No matter how much I get angry at their slow service, or their forgetting to give me this or that, or for having to remind people several times to wipe off my table after the previous guests have long gone, I just keep coming back.This morning, I arrived right after they opened and the house was already full with a long ordering line, which was moving slowly as usual. They only have one person taking orders at the walk-up counter, and it is not uncommon for him or her to discuss menu items in great detail, socialize with guests, or host conversations with the barista or other servers who frequently gather behind the bar. In this way, I guess, the good vibe of the place is created. With every kind of soul music playing loudly in the background and all sorts of happy POC eating and laughing at individual and communal tables, it feels like home as soon as you walk through the door. And it smells like your mama has been in the back cooking all day and all your cousins and mama's friends and uncles are already there and having a good time. It's warm, cozy, and the workers have nappy hair, funky haircuts, and Goodwill clothes accentuated by trendy sneakers and Wakanda-type shyt. Look to your left and see piping hot plates of pancakes and French toast with whipped cream and berries pass by as quickly as steaming soul bowls heaped high with fragrant collard greens peeking out from underneath over easy eggs. You stand in that fcuking line and wait because it's worth it when they do the shyt right.I order the honey latte every time I come, and it is made with love each and every time. It is the perfect balance of sweet, creamy espresso and heavenly foam with a touch of honey in the bottom of every cup. My favorite barista, the girl with the locs and big glasses, is not much for small talk. Each time I visit, I just thankfully retrieve my perfect latte when she yells out my name. Today, they never called out my name, so I had to go up and ask for my latte well after I'd already eaten most of my food. The food was so good, I didn't really want to get up, but they had also forgotten my biscuit and I wanted to see what it tasted like with my soul bowl (scrambled eggs, juicy collards, and bacon pieces heaped on top of hot, fried potatoes). When I asked about my latte and missing biscuit, the worker performed astonishment. He paused, looked at his iPad screen in shock, and said to me, ""I don't know HOW that happened."" [Long pause that didn't include an apology] ""We will get that right out to you, mam.""It was my turn to pause because I wanted to cuss at him for faking. Instead, I said, ""And the biscuit?""""Yes, mam. And the biscuit.""I walked back to my table, where earlier, before my food came, instead of a latte, another server had placed a small sign on my table that read ""Reserved @12:45."" Like Beyonce said at Coachella, ain't that a bytch? At that time, it was barely 10:15, and they were signaling for me to leave before my table even got wiped down. Whatever.I sat back down and waited for my biscuit. The same boy I had reminded to bring it when he brought my food and promised to ""be right back,"" showed up after a few minutes with a piping hot biscuit on a saucer. I was disproportionately happy when it came and thought, well at least it just came out of the oven. That must have been the hold-up. I happily ate it and soon, my latte arrived too, with a beautiful heart shape floating in the foam. I like to think it was to make up for being so late. I paused to work on an essay I had been writing, but when I went back to my biscuit a few minutes later, why was the MF hard as a ROCK!?!? Well, if you know like I know, then you know the only time that happens is when BREAD HAS BEEN MICROWAVED! No wonder it was piping hot! Why, oh, why they wanna play with me like this? I am so greedy that I ate it anyway, mad as could be. Almost choked on it. It made a huge ball in my right cheek and took forever to wash down. I put some greens in my mouth to soften it up, gave up on my essay, and decided it was time to write this review. With just a few minor tweaks, mainly in service training and closer attention to the high volume CEX continues to see, it can be the rockstar dining experience it's supposed to be. Bus and wipe the tables down quicker. Make servers carry tickets to ensure diners receive their FULL orders at once. Come up with a better system for delivering drinks. And for god's sake, open up another ordering line! CEX has mastered an aesthetic, as is evidenced by the crowd and by its fun SM presence. It has found a way to appeal to every kind of community member close to our beloved South Side. And there is something for everybody at CEX, but service must improve. The least CEX could do is make sure everyone has what they need, on clean tables, after they have pre-paid good money for their good food.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

CEC serves coffee, tea, mixed drinks, and food fresh from the kitchen.  Orders are taken at the register, and items will be brought to the table.  I know this spot may be just a coffee shop for some; it's a solid light lunch spot for me.  Both catfish po'boy ($8.5) and the shrimp & grits ($12, as of 02/19/2017) were delicious!  Although there was minor clumping of the grits on the bottom of the bowl, after a few stirs that didn't really bother me.  They brew Metropolis Coffee.  Hubby and I really had a blast this afternoon.  The only complaint was the portion size of each entree; a bit more generous servings would have been desirable for the prices we paid.  Otherwise, a side of salad or chips would have been greatly appreciated.  Looking for somewhere to take five in the south side?  If I happen to be in Washington Park or near the west end of the UofC campus, I certainly will stop in.",6 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Well unfortunately that didn't happen. Of the relatively small menu, two items weren't available, of which one truly disappointed me. The restaurant couldn't make pancakes..... pancakes!!! I had a yearning for pancakes and they didn't have them during breakfast hours. Realizing I already had two strikes and a third would've meant I giving up and just going somewhere else, I decided just to get a traditional breakfast. Grits, egg, turkey sausage and their signature biscuit with a hot tea as my drink. Everything thing I had was just alright. The setting was dope and the service setup was very unique for the restaurant's layout. It has the feel of a trendy restaurant that looks to turn into a neighborhood favorite casual meeting place. The patrons were very diverse in makeup, which is good because diversity makes everyone feel welcomed. All in all, I don't know if I'd try the cafe again for breakfast. The lunch menu has better reviews than the breakfast menu anyway.  Plus I'd hate to come back and leave with an unfulfilled taste for pancakes!!!",1 person voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

My standards are high since I am from Louisiana. I order the Fish and Grits. It came with fried catfish, greens, a biscuit and of course grits.The catfish was so bland. No seasoning in the batter at all. Was so disappointed. The biscuit came out and it looked amazing but tasted like cardboard. I tried to use Jelly and the jam was too watery. Now the greens were amazing. If you are working at times the music can be a little too loud. I don't think they know their identity yet.

The food is classic Southern with a twist, and it is delicious! The lunch soul bowl I got was a soupy mix of southern goodness. I loved the bits of sausage I got in there. The shrimp and grits was a little soupy for me. Four stars because the menu did not seem super diverse to me, though it looked great, and portions were a little small.

We absolutely loved the food, drink, and atmosphere so much that we've returned several times since.Why do we love this spot so much?First, the food is fresh, flavorful, and fantastic! House made biscuits and bread, hearty bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, the most delightfully flavorful house-made spicy fried chicken sandwich, delectable house-made jam, scrumptious Metropolis coffee beverages, and so much more!Second, the space has a fantastic atmosphere. Clean, open, and homey, we found ourselves able to come to Currency Exchange for a variety of reasons. Whether it be to tackle some work in the basement area with a plethora of wall plug-ins or to meet with a group of people and chat! All of your needs can be meet!Third, it is a professional and comfortable coffee/lunch restaurant that makes it clear that all people are welcome. Just as Chicago is a sanctuary city, this cafe is a sanctuary cafe for all the locals, Chicago explorers, and travelers that come through the doors.Thanks for being fabulous, Currency Exchange.

So, moving on. I was totally put off by paying first for a casual dining place. This is not a fast food joint. In addition, there was actually a TIP option field on the self-order portals BEFORE you even get your food or have a chance to experience the service!  So, I already knew I wanted shrimp and grits as it was my understanding this was one of their specialties. The ""waiter"" had the nerve to tell me they do not serve shrimp and grits on the weekends. He said the rationale was to offer their client-base something ""different"" on the weekends since everyone orders this during the week. This literally makes no sense. Creole/southern/soul food is a big part of their menu. Like, why would you have fish and grits on the weekends (which my husband ordered) and not shrimp? I could tell dude was lying by the way he paused and stuttered. Why not just say....we ran out of shrimp?I ordered the bottomless cofee. Bottomless implies to me at least one refill right? Two maybe? In order to get a refill you have to be given coffee almost immediately. I was not. After several minutes of me waiting I ask about my coffee. I was brought cold coffee. I take it back to the bar and the same waiter offers to make a fresh pot. I ask him if I should wait at the bar with him. He says no, he ""will not forget about me this time"". I literally watch him from our table making cocktails and what have you for several minutes. I eventually go back to the bar and just tell him to cancel the ""bottomless"" coffee as I was already halfway through my meal. He offers to give me a cup to go (this is not bottomless is it). They were unable to cancel but brought me $3 single dollar bills to my table. And as I think about it, why the heck would you charge for refills?Music was good, but way too loud. Maybe I am old. An older couple had to go downstairs. It was the weekend of the Chosen Few House picnic.Hubby enjoyed his food. He said the greens were a little too sweet and the biscuit was more like cake, but still good. He would return.

Great locally sourced coffee and a nice environment to get some work done or chat with a friend. Most of the coffee shops and cafes in the area are in Hyde Park and I find Currency Exchange to be a refreshing change of pace. I think it's a great addition to Washington Park and I love the whole Arts Block concept. If I had one complaint it would be that I wish they were open later!

For it to also be located on the south side, it baffles why soul food is not also listed in the cuisine section. I visited with a friend. There was no hostess stating whether to sit or not, so people come in and look around, guessing what to do. We went to a table until 10 minutes of no server, we went to the bar to order. You wait standing there for your food and drink. I had collard greens (good), fried chicken (it lacked seasoning), and a very hard and cold biscuit. The serving size was literally for a first grader. I find it odd that they want a tip when there is no server. Right after I tipped, I asked Megan what was in the next room which they announced was open. I was waiting for my friend's food at the counter still. She said, ""you'll have to go see for yourself."" That's when I knew I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. We came from the west & south burbs. Had just bought food and tipped (for no reason) and this was the ""service."" Never again. I guess I was suppose to walk around with my food and drink in hand, with no info? This was her time to share with new patrons and create return customers, but no. Better service and food is still had else where. Venue looks nice (star). Music was so loud, I couldn't hear my friend who sat directly next to me. Free parking (star).

The ambience of this place is really chill and laid back, my type of place. They offer soul food with a little bit of a twist! I had the shrimp and grits, which was my first time ever ordering it out at a restaurant. The grits were cooked perfect and so where the shrimp, it had this lemon gravy like sauce which was very strong in flavor, I did like it, even though at times it was a bit to strong, so if trying this beware of the bold seasonings in this dish! This place also has a coffee bar, which I tried their salted caramel almond espresso iced, which was very delicious! To top all of that off I had one of their home made biscuits with their homemade jam, my oh my it melted in my mouth!!

Coming in caught me off guard because you have to order right away at the front where they make the coffee. Didn't too much like that.. Wanted to sit down and relax then look it over. You also have to pay before you even get the meal! So as we sat down no waiter came up and there was no water on the table. As I continued to look around I noticed others getting up and grabbing from a table, that's when I got up and saw that's where the water and napkins and knives forks etc are!

It's actually in or around Washington Park, but it was only about a 10 minute Divvy-ride, so I went for it.The Divvy station is right across the (six-lane) street, which was pretty convenient; it's also pretty convenient to just get off the Green Line at Garfield. Anyways, I really liked the look of the inside, which I'm guessing took inspiration from a Currency Exchange that used to be on the site? I didn't ask, and I blame that on having just run a half-marathon.I ordered the chilaquiles, in part because I had no idea what they were. It's actually a lot of chips sitting in a jalapeño-tomato sauce, covered in chicken, sour cream, cheese and eggs, which I ordered scrambled. Though I've seriously never been hungover, I suspect this would do quite nicely as a fixer-upper.The flavor was over-the-top good on these. Chips were crispy, salty and flavorful, and the chicken was deliciously marinated in something resembling a distant cousin of jerk sauce. The sour cream went perfectly with fluffy, moist scrambled eggs. And the tomato sauce gave it a good kick to boot.It's a long haul from downtown, but it is worth your time to cash in at the Currency Exchange Café.",6 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The vibe is great. It's a small cafe right off the Green Line Garfield stop. It's next to UChicago campus, but not filled with students at all. Service/Ambiance: Everyone is very helpful. The owner is present almost every time we come in. It's very casual. You order at the coffee bar and your food is brought to you. Even though it's casual, the place exudes class and comfort. All and all, you feel at home. The music is a great selection (Frank Ocean, etc.) and not too loud. Laptops are not discouraged. Wifi available. Food:They offer a wide range of comfort food, southern soul food. I'm originally from the South, and the catfish is AMAZING. We ordered the Catfish Po'Boy and the Chicken Sandwich.

I mean the decor and the atmosphere are awesome. Also, I had the salted caramel almond latte, which was sooooo good. As for the food, I honestly just thought it was average, so I can't give more than 3 stars. The prices were reasonable to me. I think one pancake was $3.50, 2 strips of bacon were $3.00, latte was $4.00, the grits were probably between $3-$4. The pancake tasted average, the biscuit was also average. The grits were a little too thick for me......kinda reminded me of when I make instant grits and don't use enough water, that could just be my preference. The bacon was actually good. Also, everyone who works here seemed really friendly and nice!I would go back for the coffee or just to hangout, but I don't know about the food. Nothing was terrible, it just wasn't above average.

The ordering system is more like carry out. You order food and drinks at counter and pay before you pick a table for dine in. We picked a table which hadn't been cleaned from the prior guest. We made a ""waitress"" aware and it still took a while to get cleaned. When our drinks were ready, we had to fetch them from the counter. When food arrives we were made aware that we should have gotten our own silverware at the counter as well. I just don't understand or like the process. I wanted more food and drinks but I didn't want to get back in line to do so. The food was ok. The only saving grace for a star was my ""Coco Loco"" (cold brew, coconut and almond milk).

Stationed right at the Garfield greenline stop, it's probably missed by most commuters like me. The concept is great - I believe they wanted to transform an abandoned building into a space for food and art. I ordered the chilaquiles and loved them! Portions were very big. My other friends got the shrimp and grits and gumbo, but they didn't seem to be particularly good. Portions for those dishes were also significantly smaller. It took awhile for us to be served but the waitress was very apologetic. I'm sure service is usually better. Also, note that the free street corn for check-in is no longer valid.

Let me say that the food was quick and good. Mostly the items they have on Facebook,  they do not have,  maybe seasonal.  But the overall staff experience needs work:1. As I was standing at the counter the light skinned young man,  used his index finger to level ground coffee, and a female staff member took the measuring cup from him and used her index finger.  Both did not use a utensil or had on gloves.  And then he proceeded to the register to take orders and money.  As I was giving him my order, I noticed he had scars/scabs on his knuckles. 2. When the same female employee brought our food,  my niece ask for the wifi, the employee said it very fast and walked away.  3. When the female employee called my name to pick up my beverage,  when she handed me the teas, it spilled on the saucer,  I had to ask for a clean saucer.  No apologies. 4. Lastly,  the same male staff employee was carrying food to customers table,  with his pants falling,  we had to observe his blue stripe underwear,  in a restaurant. This was very unpleasant experience,  and my nieces who are teenagers felt the same way.  I try to explore them to other businesses outside of the suburbs. This makes me wonder about the kitchen staff,  I hope they follow the restaurant guidelines.  I hope this review will be taking into consideration.

Built as part of Theaster Gates's community developments, the currency exchange café is across the street from the Garfield Green Line and only about a mile from the UChicago campus. I've come here for breakfast twice now with my boyfriend and each time we had the breakfast plate (scrambled eggs with cheese, turkey sausage, home fries and a biscuit) and the breakfast sandwich on Texas toast. The restaurant is beautiful and decorated rustically with found items. The service is a bit slow and one of the servers was a little dismissive of one of my requests.

However the overall experience fell flat of what I expected based off the reviews posted here. I had the cold brew and my bf had the hot coffee. These were on point and the strength and flavors were great (4 stars), but that's where it ended. I got the veggie tacos and maybe I should I have tried something like the biscuits everyone raves about. Maybe my expectations are too high because I'm from Texas, but I felt the veggie tacos were like what I could get at Taco Bell but twice the price. The tortillas were obviously store bought. Beans were flavorless. They used iceberg lettuce on top with a small pitiful amount of tomatoes. They forgot my avocado that comes with the dish and they brought it out with no issue when I mentioned it was forgotten, but that didn't make it any better. I also got the free street corn yelp offer; all I can say is that I was glad it was free. Had to add salt and it made the dish kind of good, but I've grown up with real street corn and that is not it. I can tell the corn was from a can. At lease roast real corn on the cob and chop it off the cob or don't do it at all if you are planning to use canned.Also, the service was pretty lacking. The girls were nice but not attentive. I put in my coffee order right away then had to make an important call. 10 minutes later when I'm still on the phone, they come back to ask if I ordered anything. Yes, I ordered cold brew. My friend got his salad before I got my coffee. After I got done with my phone call I had to flag them down multiple times to put in an order and it took way too long to get those two sad tacos. A disappointing experience overall. If you come, it's a cool place to hang out, but just get the coffee and not their food.",4 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I ordered invitations and was very excited to celebrate my birthday at such a cool place. My event planner scheduled a meeting with the manager and the chef for a final walk through and to finalize the custom menu. I showed up for the meeting on time at 3pm-  only to be greeted by the manager who said ""oh um yeah um um well the chef is no longer employed here and all events have been cancelled"". My next question was ""did this happen last night or this morning because I don't understand why you wouldn't contact us to let us know this and to cancel the meeting"". The manager just stared at me and blinked and then said he could get someone for me to talk to. Out comes the COO who basically shrugged and just blinked and said ""we're just focused on the restaurant now and not events"". I replied, my event is a month away and you're just casually telling me I've lost my venue like it's no big deal. He replied ""sorry"" and just stared blankly. Fast forward one week to me getting an email inviting me to a special private/ticketed event happening at the restaurant on 7/1! So much for no more events! I was so upset. This place is unprofessional, inconsiderate, and they've wasted my time and my money. I've planned and hosted a multitude of events large and small all over the city from millennium park to small venues like space 1858 and this was the worst experience I've ever had. It's disappointing to not be able to support black owned small businesses because of shady unprofessional practices. There was no accountability and not even the slightest effort to make it right or be mildly accommodating. They didn't even offer me a glass of water while I waited and tried to sort out what was happening. To this day I've not heard from anyone, not the owner, Manager, or COO with a sincere apology. Should they go out of business I'm sure they will blame others for a lack of support and not themselves for running this place in such a garbage manner. CEX is trash and I will never ever return. Such a huge disappointment and inconvenience.",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I ordered the fish and grits and when they brought out the food, the catfish had a chunk missing like it had been bitten. I am not exaggerating. Fried fillet with 10% missing.  I pointed this out and they brought me a completely fresh meal.  My wife ordered decaf, they brought her regular.  Instead of hiring seasoned restaurant staff, I think they went for a certain hipster look and hired people who have obviously never worked at a restaurant.  Slow, half-informed with little in the way of charm.  I guess that's what you get when you offer no real opportunity to tip them anyway.  (I'm not tipping when I'm paying first genius)This was just a weird place.  I know they are new and will probably improve because the food is good.  But the hipster setup and process that somehow manages to use modern technology and still be inefficient,needs to be rethought entirely.  Food: B+Service: FEnvironment: AParking: A",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I met an interview subject here on Sunday for an hour-long chat, and was totally unimpressed with the service. When I walked in, I couldn't figure out if I should seat myself or wait for someone to seat me. It was busy so I wound up seating myself while waiting to figure out where my subject was, but there was no acknowledgement of my presence for at least 5 minutes. No biggie - I figured out where my subject was seated and went over to her table anyways after perusing the menu for a few minutes. She had already ordered for herself and her sons, so I flagged down the waitress and ordered a hot apple cider before getting into my interview. She acknowledged my order but then... either totally forgot about it or the baristas just forgot to make my drink. At this point, my interview subject was talking so I didn't feel comfortable interrupting our interview to ask for my drink. Service was slow overall but it seems like my subject was pretty happy with what she had ordered for herself and her sons, so that's why two stars instead of one. The music here was also really loud and didn't really give me a cafe vibe, and it was definitely hard for me to hear my conversation, even though I was just sitting on the opposite side of the table. I'm sure their drinks are great, but it just wasn't an awesome experience for me.",2 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

What a fantastic find! The space is open and eclectically decorated; very sophisticated but fun. The two staff were incredibly friendly and answered any questions we had. We ordered the Coco Loco, La Mañana, and Chilaquiles. The Coco Loco cold brew with almond milk and coconut syrup was smooth and not overly sweet with great coconut flavor. La Mañana was a nice light breakfast of ripe grapefruit, hard boiled egg and a soft, delicious, homemade biscuit. The chilaquiles were a perfectly proportioned mix of tortillas, chicken, and cheese with a fried egg and mouth-watering chipotle sauce. Prices were great for portion sizes. If we are ever in the area, we'd definitely stop by again!

Nice atmosphere for coffee, conversation & food u can also have events here. They have nice smooth music playing in background not too loud. The décor is interesting. Now the food. I ordered the COCO LOCO(cold coffee, coconut syrup & almond milk. The flavors were nice just wish the coffee was a tad stronger w/the ice it became watery. I had the BREAKFAST BOWL(2 eggs however u liked mine was fried w/ lil yoke they did it right in between rice & I had bacon which was diced up. It had decent flavor to it. The biscuit wasn't for me it wasn't flaky more doughy I'll pass on it next time. Overall I'll go back & try the lunch menu.
