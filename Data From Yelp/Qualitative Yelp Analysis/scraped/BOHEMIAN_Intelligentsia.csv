The hype is real and everyone should know it. Coffee offerings rotate depending on the season but the staples are like all the other Intelligentsia locations. Everything is freshly made, including the basic coffee. So be patient while they do a pour over. They also offer alternatives like soy and oat milk. Yes I said oat milk. The baristas are excellent now and quite friendly if you're into communicating before your caffeine. Good and quick service any time of the day. As you enter in the merch and bagged coffee is on the right before you hit the counter. The coffee offering list is posted on the wall to the right of where you place your order. Still not sure what to order? Just ask. The biggest problem about this location is seating. While there is plenty of it at the communal table and smaller tables, this location is just busy. Am I complaining? Not at all! There are outlets around the perimeter inside but sometimes snagging a seat on the wall can be difficult, especially in the mornings when everyone is going to work.

This is definitely a coffee shop where you pay a bit more for quality and nicer ambiance. They're doing something right here because this place is continually busy and has a steady influx of customers coming in. Despite the busy atmosphere, this coffee shop is a well run ship and drinks are served quickly and tables are kept clean. You'll see a combo of studiers/people who linger here as well as people who just stop by for a quick drink. This cafe has nice big windows that lets in lot of natural light and the minimalistic table and chairs are just comfortable enough to get some work done without wanting to be here all day. There are also ample plugs all around the shop for those who need to recharge their laptops or cell phones. Again, this is set up in a great area and caters to multitude of people looking for a quick stop for coffee or looking for a busy coffee shop atmosphere to do some work.

And my boyfriend is a coffee nut so Intelligentsia interested him with the good reviews. Our Lyft driver dropped us off here and luckily the place wasn't packed with people so we were able to chill off to the side of the store with all our luggage. I ended up getting their matcha latte while my boyfriend opted for their coffee and we were able to use the free wifi offered here in order to look up more places to visit in Chicago. The people working here were friendly and didn't seem annoyed that we were dragging in hella baggage which I'm grateful for because it was a cold day and if they had kicked us out... well, damn.

I got a latte, which was VERY good. Zero complaints on that (except that the latte art wasn't as impressive as other Intelligentsia locations, but that's total nitpicking and has nothing to do with the great taste). We also were able to find seating right away in the middle of the day on a Saturday, which is something that's usually pretty difficult to do in Wicker Park. Additionally, we were in close enough distance to an outlet to plug in. Score! However, there were a few issues, the largest of which was that it was very cold inside. Today was warmer than it's been most of the winter so far (about 40 degrees), so I wonder if they thought they didn't need to have the heat on anymore due to it being relatively warmer. Whatever the case was, it was very drafty and uncomfortable. Maybe we had the worst of it being under some kind of vent with a fan, but we had to wear our coats inside for the few hours we spent here while working on our laptops. I noticed that the people sitting next to us also had their coats on. Also (and this isn't as big of a deal), but the space is sort of cramped and awkward particularly when power chords are involved. There were two women in there with strollers and I had to unplug my chord so they could get by. I'm not quite sure why the outlets aren't underneath the tables.  All in all, it was an A-OK experience. Assuming the cold temperature was just a one-time, irregular time, then I would totally come back. My latte was honestly fantastic, and being able to find a seat with ease something I really value. If the temperature is all good the next time I return, then I'll update my review.",4 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,3,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Was not good.  It was quite confusing.  It was heavily diluted while still having a strong vinegar note and a slight bitter note.  I gave it to my friend to try and seeing their reaction, I knew this wasn't my imagination.  I attempted to drink it again and couldn't.  I eventually opened the cup and noticed there was a decent amount of grinds and yet somehow the coffee was light in colour.  I'm sure this was a mistake ...

Hands down, this is third wave coffee at its finest. The coffee here is IMPECCABLE! It's smooth, creamy, and the notes are so on point. I got the Matalapa El Salvador - I tasted a floral essence with hints of honey, which was simply divine. No cream or sugar needed. However, expect to wait longer than your normal Starbucks time and to pay a little more ($4/cup), but for true coffee lovers - this is the best new thing to come to Wicker Park. Note that soy milk is actually free, which is really great for all the vegan loving hipsters in Wicker.THE AMBIANCEThis place is very modern and warm with large windows allowing the fresh sunshine to come in and wake up the customers if the coffee doesn't do the trick. It is lined with plastic red boxes used as stools, long black tables for community sharing, and lit with rows of lights dangling from the ceiling. It is quite small but it looks like there is free wi-fi and multiple places to sit to get some work done. The tables were displayed with fresh fragrant bouquets of beautiful flowers, so nice that they look like centerpieces at a reception. I hope these will always be there! The servers are all very friendly and look like they enjoy what they are doing. There are multiple french presses, scales, coffee, and t-shirts for sale.

Unfortunately, it doesn't stand up well to the milk added so my au lait didn't have much flavor. Plus my au lait was 5 dollas for a 12 oz drink...uh no.  The latte I had the second time was pretty good, beautiful of course but in this drink also espresso didn't stand up to the milk at all.  Creamy, very little coffee taste.  So if ya want straight coffee, go for sure, some of the best in Chicago, but the other drinks were meh for the price.And the seating... the seating... WTF?  Am I a five year old playing with blocks?? I want a back to my chair please. Or is it a table?? Maybe both??

Overall, they serve a good cup o' joe and some other interesting and delicious beverages like the sparkling teas.  Unfortunately, my last two visits have resulted in a near public shaming by the manager because I asked for something different about my drink and they didn't like it.  The first was a sparking iced tea where I asked for a little ice which was met by a lecture from the barista with an emphatic 'no, we don't do that because it's sparkling and not meant to be consumed that way.""  The second time I went in, I ordered the same thing and when I received my drink it was a 10 oz cup with 2.5 inches of foam on my the top.  After the foam settled (I hadn't taken a drink yet) I asked the barista/manager to top it off.  The response I received was that 'the foam makes the drink and they usually leave two inches of foam.'  After staring at me for what felt like forever, the barista only agreed to top off the drink after I argued that if I'm going to pay $4.50 for a glass of sparkling tea, then I care less about the presentation and more about getting my money's worth of product.' She rolled her eyes and finally topped the drink off, but not before she got the last word in that they would do it just this once but it's not something they do.'Bottom line, the drinks are good, slightly overpriced and the staff is just as pretentious as the Starbucks down the street.  I may keep trying.  Hopefully third time is the charm!",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
