This is a quiet cafe in Logan square - kind of reminds me of a 50's diner converted into a coffee shop. They don't offer any sugar free options which is common among the third wave shops. The latte was not good. The espresso was bitter - I struggled to drink the latte and sadly didn't enjoy it. My latte art was sad - I appreciate the attempt but didn't get even a flower. Nice to have for here mugs. Has to put Splenda in my latte but that still didn't make it enjoyable. They used Guatemala for their daily espresso which could be partly why I didn't enjoy it. Unroasted:  okay let's try this again.   Walking in it looks and feels like your pops den.    The staff was friendly but counting down the minutes to get out of here.    Love the 50s diner style coffee bar.    The art was decent and appreciate the effort.    Coffee was too bitter for me had to add sugar.,voted for this review,Thomas G.,javascript:;,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I believe the success of a cafe can be attributed to a few rudimentary but greatly overlooked qualities - it's just coffee, not magic. I meannn what is the hiring process at THIS coffee shop? There must be stipulations in order to be employed as a hipster barista here, you must 1. Be apathetic to anything and everything, 2. Be so soft spoken and quiet that people could only hear you by summoning demons from the Necronomicon and ask them WTF you just said, 3. Detest any and every MALE that walks into the café who isn't, Anton LaVey, H.P. Lovecraft, or Barbra Streisand, and 4. Practice witchcraft daily. What is it that we all love about coffee shops? It's really simple actually, strong but delicious coffee, good music, a warm and welcoming atmosphere with interesting and/or attractive people. The ""coffee"" could vaguely be called as such because it tasted more like someone who just drank real coffee peed into a cup, which mind you was only equally as warm but not nearly as flavorful. And although the awkward mortuary like atmosphere in this shop encourages absolute funeral-like-silence and stillness, you are made to stand up, walk over to the counter (with the judgmental barista overlooking their work like Rasputin above the Gulag) pick up the urine-like-substance, and as if you are a monkey on a circus tightrope, carefully walk back to your micro sized table meticulously carrying an overly full cup of said pee-coffee, clanking and spilling all the way back. All this whilst, of course, everyone stares at you in disgust and disdain, a problem perhaps easily solved if the music wasn't going on and off as if the Witch baristas were in a collective seance communicating with dead customers who had previously drank their pee-coffee, but instead only managed to channel terrible MGMT songs through a sound system that someone donated to goodwill in 1997. I have certainly been gaslighted, I left questioning my own sanity, like Macbeth being called by the coven of WITCHES, as well as feeling like I was severely molested (and ironically I happen to be catholic).",voted for this review,Katherine B. and 3 others,javascript:;,Useful,2,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Well let me tell you, this happens to be one of them. Not only does Gaslight roast their own coffee in house, but their small food menu and selection of pastries is quite enticing.I've gotten lattes, drip coffee, iced coffee, and iced tea here, and I haven't been disappointed. The only disappointment is the price, but that's pretty common for a small local shop. They do have free WiFi with outlets and it's a great spot to get some work done if you can snag one of the tables near the outlets ;) I also ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup the other day, and the tomato soup has a really pleasant spice to it and the grilled cheese came on a really delicious parmesan-encrusted bread with perfectly melty cheese on the inside. It's definitely pricey at $14 for a grilled cheese and tomato soup, but the portion is large, the depth of the soup bowl makes for easy dipping, and it was more gourmet than your standard can of Campbell's with white bread/american cheese grilled cheese.The service has always been good - fast and friendly. And you can tell this is definitely a neighborhood spot, with lots of regulars, and lots of employees high-fiving each other and the patrons that come in!

Let the discerning rejoice. This Chicago highlight has all the 3rd wave coffee goodness you crave with a total neighborhood feel. This is the perfect marriage of roasters and baristas who know what they are doing. Though I will say more, if you are trying to pick your one stop for coffee in Chi-town look no further.Let's start with the ambience. Right when you walk in you feel like you are right where you want to be. Cozy wood colors, lower light (but not dim), appropriate levels of music and the steady singing of steam wands and high end grinders. With about 6 or 7 individual tables, two bar areas and a shared community picnic style table, there is plenty of seating. And get this - FREE WIFI AND POWER OUTLETS. All the snobby goodness of the coffee with no one glaring at you for posting up for a work day (but do the right thing and keep buying coffee the longer you sit).The baristas were kind, engaging and helpful. Their recommendations were spot on (my Colombian Chimex was spot on!!!). The place was super clean, had two spotless bathrooms and a steady (but never overbearing) stream of customers. They offer a drip coffee, but if you have the time spring for the Chimex. The espresso drinks are also killer and expertly executes. Tea? Hot chocolate? Yes! They can accommodate you.

Food: I've never tried their pastries (there usually weren't a lot of options) but they have a really nice menu that they serve out of their kitchen.  It can be a little on the pricey side, but it puts other coffee shop food to shame, particularly the avocado toast and the grilled cheese.

So is the coffee. This place was common and cold.I have never had a cup of coffee so fantastic it   made me want to be a loyal patron of an establishment... and I still haven't. It is normally the ambiance and/or the customer service that brings me back and all I can say is I will not be going back to this place. The only thing I feel this place had going for it was the decor (rustic). The customer service was absent.

Coming from spending a lot of time in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, I easily made myself at home. This place had been recommended to me by a friend who lives in the area. I could see now why. There's a ton of seating, cool rustic atmosphere, and a pretty extensive menu with drinks and food. I just got a drip coffee, but I could really taste the crisp flavor of the coffee beans.I was surprised for a Saturday afternoon that there were a ton of people working and eating a late brunch. For the amount of tables there were, I was only able to find a seat at their bar off to the side of the espresso machine. Their wifi is good, which is always a big plus in my book.

I always check out what the audience is for a coffee shop to see if it's a true neighborhood hang. This one fit well. Plenty of people just coming in for a quick cup, stopping to study, or having a work meeting.

It's the perfect start to your morning, afternoon, and evening - whenever you need a warm and comforting beverage (with a kick of caffeine). Gaslight's atmosphere is really nice and comfortable. Don't let all the trendy people and hipster decor intimidate you. The set up is nice. You can sit at the bar, a community table, or a more private table.

We ordered the Colombian Coffee Pour Over, Latte with Almond Milk, Breakfast Bowl, and the GasLight Breakfast. Starting with the drinks, the Colombian Pour Over was intensely flavorful and robust. The Latte with Almond Milk was creamy, smooth, rich, and absolutely delicious. The Almond Milk added a slight sweetness to the overall coffee. Now onto the food! The Breakfast Bowl was savory and delicious! The little ham pieces of bacon bits really added a bite to the rice, the fried egg on top really pulled this dish together! The GasLight Breakfast was incredibly delicious as well! The fried Duck egg laid on top of a savory slice of ham, flavorful sun dried tomatoes, a smear of some nutty and green spread, and a hardy slice of toasty bread.

The decor and ambiance was pretty cool. It was kind of a rustic, woody feel to the place. While I was there reading my book for about an hour the other patrons were either chatting with friends, working on laptops alone, or reading like me. Definitely a chill place to get some good coffee/espresso and relax.Would definitely recommend, I did not give Gaslight 5 stars simply because it was not the BEST espresso I ever had and when reviewing a coffee shop if it's not the best I don't think it warrants a 5.

You have all your typical coffee shop characteristics here: hipster individuals, good coffee, and free wifi. What makes this place stand out is that they offer food that you can order and they'll bring it to your seat. While I didn't get to make use of such a service, I saw others doing so and it seems like a genius idea for anyone hoping to stay there for extended periods of time so that you don't have to leave to grab a bite. The interior provides wonderful large windows that bring in beautiful light. However this makes it pretty hot if you're sitting anywhere near the windows. Either they need to install some blinds or crank up the AC because when the place is crowded and the only place to sit is near the windows, and people literally sweat in those spots. Staff here is friendly but they lacked a sense of professionalism. There was a lot of hanging out in the back. Also during my stay here, they consistently fiddled with the volume of the music playing. I don't mind music playing at coffee shops, it's the norm, yet at this place they really turned up the volume to the point that I could hear it through my over-ear headphones. People like music, I understand that, but one's own personal taste of music shouldn't be so loud that others are forced to hear it even with attempts to drown it out haha.",Was this review …?,,,Useful,,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

You are perfect. You have so many dead animals lying around that even a hunk of roadkill would feel at home here. So many hipsters flock to your premises that you could put a hipster factory out of business. And there are more human hands in jars here than I have ever seen anywhere else. Thank you for being who you are.Doesn't it sound wonderful? For real, it is. So wonderful in fact that I had to stop here again on the way back through Chicago. Of the eleven coffee shops I went to in Chicago, this was my favorite. Favorite by a slight margin over other places but favorite nonetheless. The first time was early in the morning, right after it opened. It was very calm and peaceful at that hour, with all the soft colors and natural materials. My pour-over was a winner in my book. In fact it won a prize for being slightly better than any other coffee I had in Chicago. Maybe it was because it was the next morning and I was more ready for coffee again. And I'm not sure where they get their pastries from but that place should get some kind of award, or at least a five star review. Canelé and almond croissant. The next time was around noon and Man it was hopping, with an incredibly high hipster to other people ratio. I got a fairly great espresso pulled on the La Marzocco Strada. I also picked up a bag of in house roasted Ethiopian beans for home use. **Warning- blunt ending approaching** It turned out decently in aeropress and siphon, even though it seemed like I had a hard time getting proper body out of it or something.

I did a couple things different this time. I dressed down, and I paid with exact change. I stopped off I at Kmart on my way in from OHare and spent $16 on a black hoodie and paired it with a pair of dark blue AG jeans. This time not only did the skinny guy behind the counter laugh at my joke, 2 patrons smiled at me. Wearing a suit the first time was a mistake. I noticed this time that not only do they have bike parking on the sidewalk ( which is probably due to the city, not the store)  they allow you to pile your bike up just inside the door as well. This is handy if you don't want your to get cold or wet. I'd like to see them institute valet parking for bicycles.  If I go through the effort of riding my bike down there, I'd like to have some greet me, take my bike and then bring up to the door when I'm done. I did venture into the restroom on this visit. When I opened the door I was not surprised by the vintage black and white tile on the floor, but the low wattage lighting threw me a bit. The toilet seat was down and it had not been fished by the pervious guest. I was confused at first and worried that I was in the wrong room. Because there's was a single swath of TP floating in the dark yellow aftermath. Clearly the patrons need to stay more hydrated. The urine was level 4 on my unhealthily scale. ( 4= dehydration / poor diet) 5= possible kidney failure (6= sepsis) if you used the men's room there today, please go see your doctor. The coffee was great, the barista was skinny on top and pleasant, the crowd was warm and approachable. I highly recommend it.

It was a pretty cozy setting on the inside, so if you're looking for some place quiet, its good to get some work done. However, they don't have very much seating. I got a small chai to go, and I was kind of disappointed. Mostly because it was more expensive than Starbucks and the small was TINY! I would understand if the quality was much better, but I didn't really think so. They were also very very slow.. My drink took about 5 minutes, and there was no one ahead of me. My friend also ordered when I did, and after about 10 minutes we decided to ask what was taking so long for his drink. I guess they forgot to make it.. So we waited about another 5 minutes for his drink.

Really random stuffed animals around from a duck to a rabbit decorate the place. The place is not crazy packed and ample street parking around. It seems somewhat hip but I really think the high school chairs should be changed out into something a little nicer. Was kind of strange that they write orders with a sharpie on the counter.The FOOD.DRINKI had a decent tree called the really green tea which I thought was green tea but looked super green. Did not taste like green tea and it was ok.EATI had their house special for breakfast. I was bummed they didn't serve the lunch before 11 but it was still pretty good. It was a piece of bread with goat cheese I think topped with bacon and an egg. I had no idea how to eat it without it turning into a crazy mess. It also came with a salad with some sliced cumquats. Overall it seemed ok - I don't think the bread part is really needed - it kind of made it hard to eat.The SERVICEThe line was fairly short on a Sunday morning and the tea made it out in seconds but the sandwich was more like 15+ min.

I start off with a drip coffee or a latte and work for a couple hours at a table next to large windows letting in lots of natural light (always helpful when working). I order something off the breakfast menu - typically the Meat and Potato Bowl that's tasty and filling - and work for a few more hours.Gaslight is my ideal Friday workstation - great coffee, food, and ambiance.

This was easily my favorite. I went to Wormhole (WH), Caffe Streets (CS), and a few others. Those other two were still very good coffeeshops, and I would definitely return, but I'll try to enumerate here why Gaslight was my favorite.- The coffee was the best. Had pourover and a cortado here. It wasn't miles ahead of the other places, but it was better.- The server dudes were super nice. It looked like a place I'd love to work. (WH staff was also really awesome too, though).- Music was the best - started with nice, unobtrusive, but interesting ambient and moved on to Elliott Smith. WH was a bit more in-your-face with lo-fi 90s punk.- The food was delicious. I had a turkey/bacon thingy on foccacia. Great and only $7.- Lots of seating with bountiful plugs. Definitely more than either WH or CS.Finally, I'll say that each of these places had its own distinct vibe. If I had to sum them each up for the purposes of comparison, I'd say WH is punky/trashy (in a good way), CS is upscale modern (also in a good way), and Gaslight is upscale vintage (in the best way possible). It's like a very very well done Etsy store or a hipster shop in SF's Mission District that sells nothing in particular. (Again, in the best way possible).",1 person voted for this review,,,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I ate a flaky strawberry ""Pop Tart"" that tasted delicious. There are some reviews that the staff is rude, etc. But you have to be aware that you're dealing with hipsters, and honestly?

You may, at this time, wish to insert the usual snark about what happens when you assume, and I will have to concede your point.  The reality is that you get a small slice of less than fresh baguette, a whole boiled duck egg, a dollop of cheese, and some sorry sliced fruit.  I love Derrida but he has no business deconstructing my breakfast.  To add insult to injury, the duck egg was bland and the cheese a bit too, shall we say, aromatic? for a morning sandwich.So, learn from my mistakes and stick with the coffee.  Aesthetically, the store has a northwoods thing going on, but the furniture and chairs are straight out of middle school shop class.  Not a very comfortable place to linger, which is unfortunate.  But I did learn one valuable lesson, which is never boil a duck egg.  It sucks all the flavor out of it.  Frying is definitely the way to go with that fowl, my friends.Four stars for coffee, one for food and decor.",16 people voted for this review,,,Useful,15,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Was expecting to be blown away from all of the positive reviews, but was just underwhelmed. Gaslight decor is hip, but austere and somewhat cold feeling. A horned animal hangs on a wallpapered wall, with long tables and benches- More gastropub than cozy coffee hangout.Looking for their whole bean coffee, which I assumed to be their specialty, I had to be directed to the small display against the wall of a few picked-over  bags of only three varieties. No descriptions of the coffees whatsoever on the display or bags. I know enough about coffees to avoid the crisp Latin Americans and headed for the Ethiopian. $17 for less than 16 oz. seems steep. (No pun intended).I'm a small batch coffee drinker. I love my Alterra, Intelligentsia, Dark Matter, I know what good coffee tastes like. The coffee at Gaslight is good, but not $17 good...Ordered the one drip coffee they had available that I did not see advertised anywhere, and also told they could do any of their coffees via cone drip process. I'd love to watch coffee drip, if perhaps the place wasn't so sterille, not exactly comfy. I guess for this coffee roasting business model I prefer Caffe Streets, Star Lounge, to the sterile, hip, expensive Gaslight Coffee Roasters. I'm sure I'll get lots of hate mail from newbie Logan Squarians now.",18 people voted for this review,,,Useful,9,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

And I can't remember the coffee tasting so bad. I've had bad coffee in my life but this was seriously one of my worst experiences. I took a sip and had to pour it out.
