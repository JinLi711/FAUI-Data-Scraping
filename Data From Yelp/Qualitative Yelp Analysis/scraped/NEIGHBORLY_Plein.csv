I loved the mascarpone stuffed French toast! It was such a good mix of creamy mascarpone and blueberry sauce. Absolutely delightful! The biscuit breakfast sandwich was also good but paled in comparison to the French toast. There is seating indoors and outdoors, although it was a bit crowded (Sunday morning). It was quite chilly when I was there but some people had to sit outside due to lack of seating inside. There are outlets through the seating area.

It's kind of odd because the cashier counter is always friendly. They're patient even when the line winds out of the door. My problem is with the table bussers. Each time I've been they've removed either a plate, cup or menu without uttering a single word. It's so shocking and quick that I've barely been able to get their attention to return.

Though the front area is currently under construction, walking into the cafe (the cafe is on the right, the bookstore on the left) I was immediately struck by how bright, clean, and modern the place is. It's not super large and the majority of the seating is at long tables or a long bar overlooking Robie House next door. I wouldn't say the place is especially kid friendly, because most of the seating is at bar style stools or chairs and I didn't see any high chairs around. However, if you came at an off peak time and could sit at a table it would be a great place for a kid.The menu is pretty extensive, note that they stop serving the plein bowls and tartines after 3 pm.I love that they serve Topo Chico, I don't see that much outside of Texas. They also have fresh squeezed grapefruit and orange juice in their cooler.I was hungry, but not for a full blown meal so I got the soup of the day, tomato basil. I was very disappointed by the quality of the tomato basil soup, it tasted like they opened a bottle of tomato sauce from the store and poured it into a bowl. Furthermore, the soup itself wasn't even hot, it was tepid at best even though it took the employees about 10 minutes to bring it to me. The French bread on the side was also stale. I really enjoy tomato basil soup, but there was absolutely no complexity or dimension to the soup, I didn't taste any basil, just cold tomatoes. It was $5.50 for the bowl and $3 for the large mug of breakfast tea I got on the side. The tea was strong and served in a big mug, though I wish the server asked if I wanted room for cream as it was filled almost completely to the brim. This seems primarily a place for UChicago students and faculty to study and socialize, light music played in the background, but the place never got loud. I will definitely be coming back, but I can see how it's easy to spend quite a bit of money quickly here, everything looks very good!They also do to-go food and drinks and I thought it was cool that they have a coat rack at the entrance for backpacks and coats.

The service is always quick and attentive and the self-serve sparking water is a huge plus.My favorite items are the steak bowl, sweet pepper baguette, and hazelnut beignet. The steak bowl reminds me a lot of a Filipino menudo dish, which I absolutely love. While the sweet pepper baguette is my favorite, the baguette itself is always pretty hard.

It's decorated minimally but tastefully. It seemed to be quite busy when I arrived there at about 11AM, so try to grab a seat as quickly as possible to ensure you have a spot to sit. I had ordered the Mascarpone Stuffed Brioche French Toast with a vanilla latte, and sweet Lord did those hit the spot after walking in the blistering cold, which I'm sure wasn't that cold but coming from Texas, anything less than 60 degrees is cold to us...Anyway, the french toast was sweet but not overly sweet, which was great because if it had been, RIP me as I had paired that with the latte.

I spend tons of money here so it feels particularly annoying and misguided on their part-- I'm not here to freeload a seat, I want food and drink.

The coffee and espresso drinks are great, the food is delicious with many menu options, and the space is designed beautifully to showcase the view of Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House next door.On past trips back to the university I've kind of stuck to my old haunts (Plein Air wasn't open yet while I was in college), but this time I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did. My vanilla latté was perfect - not too sweet. I also got a sandwich that was a lunch special - chicken with poblano peppers, avocado, and beans on a French roll. Absolutely delicious. It was a tad messy to eat, but so yummy. The sandwiches also come with a small serving of fresh salad with a simple vinaigrette, which is nice.I enjoyed my sandwich while listening to the fascinating discussions other patrons were having and enjoying the view out the enormous windows. Had this cafe been open when I was a student, I think I would have come to work here quite a bit.

The shades of tree and the overall enclosure made it a great spot for staying cool and away from the foot traffic on the street.

It's a hop-skip away from Harper as well, which makes the commute more palatable than decent options like Medici, Salonica, or the food trucks.Plein Air has a partnership with Pleasant House Bakery, and though the $10+ price tag is semi-steep for a quick lunch, a taste of a royal pie (I recommend the steak and ale) will leave your stomach feeling satisfied, if not your wallet. I've gotten a pastry a time or two as well. I remember the croissant being fine, as in better than Starbucks, but not quite up to a Parisian standard. Their sandwich baguette bread is simply too hard to be palatable. If you're going sandwich, I recommend making the extra hike to Medici.I like to pair a pie with a maple latte (in the winter; they've since switched to vanilla), which really sets the bank account back. But that latte is fantastically delicious. Plein Air uses Metric coffee. I don't love it as much as my other go-to's like Intelligensia, La Colombe, or Passion House, but it's pretty good (and still better than the Starbucks or Intelligensia franchised coffee in Harper).",,,3 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The lemonade was very delicious. My friends who drink coffee think the coffee is great.Food: There food is really well done. I highly recommend the french toast for breakfast and the mushroom pie for lunch. If you want a light breakfast or snack the sourdough toast with butter and honey is delicious!

The purpose of this review is to inform the public about the inedible properties of the sandwiches produced at this location. I have patronized this place once in the past and was left unimpressed at the plebian nature of the food served. However, I would like share an incident that happened two weeks ago: when my very good friend Madeleine purchased a sandwich here. The sandwich was so hard, that it chipped her tooth. I will now illuminate how hard the bread of the sandwich was. If this bread had been at the last supper, we wouldn't have had a savior, but a Jewish man with tooth ache. Bread of this strength would serve as a stronger deterrent against immigrants from coming to the US than Trump's proposed wall. The bread provided enormous resistance. So much, that Madeleine's front left canine tooth looked like gnomes had mistaken it for marble ripe for sculpture-making and then abandoned the project realizing their mistake. The incident left Madeleine looking like a lopsided Dracula. When she would open her mouth, I was just as terrified as the Ottoman force that once approached the real Dracula's stronghold. So I warn the readers who are perusing through this review, if you are unfortunate enough to purchase sandwich at this business, be sure to check if the sandwich bends under duress. This is one material strength test that you must hope fails. Many in the Yelp community are for some reason obsessed with location and atmosphere. I will devote the last part of my review for this demographic. Painting a piece of iron bar with golden pigment would not make the bar gold. Similarly, serving mediocre food in a posh location would not change the quality of mediocre food. This is the kind of place where you would hope to seduce an atheist Divinity student from Portland, Oregon whose patrician aspirations would be to dwell in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Perfect for the up and coming bourgeoisie crowd who would gawk and gape at a Whole Foods.  With all that being said, I hope the Plein Air staff realize that mediocrity of their pursuit. I urge them to work on the softness of their breads, and improve the taste of their sandwiches. Plein Air looks good because it is in a prime location within Hyde Park. Plein Air are like the poor Mughal empire which only looked advanced because greedy East Indian Company twats haven't arrived yet with steel and gunpowder.

And understandably so since campus lunch options nearby don't have the healthiest options really, and this place having tasty kale salads and quinoa bowls it is good brain food for anyone needing a break from work on campus!I got their quinoa bowl with a tomato curry sauce and you can tell that everything was really fresh. Their pies are also super popular and they often run out I've been told, so go earlier on in the day if that is something that you want. I definitely need to come back and try and their steak and ale pie (and then hopefully split that with someone who wants the kale salad with citrus and quinoa to try and make it a little healthier ha ha) But for the area, if you can find a spot sit here, they have great coffee drinks and such, and yes it is a little pricey, but hipster food land always is :-)",,,5 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I thought I would be here every week, enjoying those delicious pies. But I was not there every week. I was only there once.One trip to Plein Air Cafe was enough for me. For starters, the menu is super confusing in that it is half hidden. When you enter the restaurant (right off the Seminary Co-Op Bookstore), all you see is a menu for coffee drinks. Nothing else. You have to go up to the register to find the menu of pastries and other savory items. The food is good. The Royal Pies (I had the Chicken Balti) are as delicious as expected. But their service needs work. I ordered the chicken balti pie at the register and had something else (I think a salad) delivered to me instead. I stared at it for a while wondering what it was before taking it up to the register. I had to stand and wait in line again to return it as everyone moving around the service door ignored me. I found that incredibly annoying considering it was lunch rush and the line took about 10 minutes to go through.Finally, my actual pie was delivered and I thought I could get some work down while I ate. Wrong. The music is a weird, eclectic mix that is way too loud for the tiny room it's projected into. To make matters worse, the tables are stacked basically on top of each other so you can hear the entire conversation from the group next to you, including inflections and breaths. The overall decor is a bit confusing. Some taxidermy, some cacti. To be honest, I thought they were cute until I realized there was very little room for two plates, two drinks, and the centerpieces. My friend and I spent a few minutes maneuvering everything before we could actually settle down to do work. At the end of the experience, I didn't feel the need to go back. $10+ dollars on lunch in a crowded room with loud music and very few outlets. Not something worth returning for.

Three taxidermy art pieces complement the warm wood table tops & starkly contrast with the cool industrial pipes & chairs. Contrast is compelling!Quiche with ham & gruyere cheese, together with a very flakey crust & ethereal egg custard, accompanied with mixed greens & a very light vinaigrette satisfied my Sunday wedding reception recovery & with water. Then the Raspberry Beignets & English Breakfast Tea steeped exactly for 4.5 minutes, made my day!What appealed to me besides the perfect location & cool decor was the welcoming ambiance. From the butcher block table tops on industrial pipes, to the hooks for my messenger bag, to the courteous wait staff, Plein Air Cafe is home to professors, neighbors, students, tourists & wanderers.I chose to sit at one of the two long tables with a taxidermy bird perched under a glass cloche. When three professors joined me, the bird gave us a great ice breaker discussion.  We even discussed the wall display of a Red Tailed Fox, as having been caught in the hen house.Overall, the ambiance, convenience, delicious offerings & garden view beckoned.

Given that fact, it is probably no surprise that the Plein Air Cafe has received the sort of reception it has, or so I hear; its attitude and decor are not so dissimilar from some of the eateries populating the old warehouses in the West Loop (and with much commercial success, I also hear).The last time I came here for brunch it was a continental breakfast, a slice of quiche and two coffees - none of it very memorable - but let's all be honest with each other and admit it was never about the food. For those coming to Hyde Park from other colleges, in particular, for Masters programs in the humanities, there is demand for a place to eat which is just slightly out the the price range for most milktoast-colored undergraduates and Plein Air is just such a place. Alternatively, one should just admit that after 10 years in a PhD program sipping coffee in a cafe instead of typing away in a computer lab that you were never that serious about art history anyway.Obviously, for a bong-smoking lolcat, this is not my scene - though the taxidermy animals don't help either.

Hyde Park is definitely coming up in the world as far as more restaurants, bars and entertainment. It's nice to know this place exist and it's so close to University of Chicago campus.  At any rate, Plein Air cafe reminded me of Antique Taco for the decorations. It's very antique-like, shabby chic decorated with a chill vibe (or very country hipster--and yes, I just invented that word but it fits). They offer a variety of pastries, coffees, teas, salads, sandwiches and pies. I decided to check out the meat pies (a fancy pot pie) because per yelp they seemed highly recommended. I ordered the kale pie, and it was delicious! Inside the pie, was a marriage of flavors. It had kale, herbs, Parmesan cheese and white wine sauce. Beyond fabulous. I did not leave one crumb on the plate. If you are a meat eater and you order this dish---there won't be a minute where you miss the meat. The crust of the pie was heavenly as well. The crust is buttery, flaky, soft inside yet crunchy outside.  The pie comes with a small serving of field greens  that are lightly dressed in balsamic. The pies seem petite but they are very deep (or high in height) and it's pretty filling. My friend order the goat cheese sandwich on a baguette which was also served with field greens. It looked very delicious as well. In addition, they have a water station where you can decide between ""still"", ""chilled"", and ""sparkling"" water which is quite fancy. I'd definitely return back to Plein Air cafe.",,,2 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
