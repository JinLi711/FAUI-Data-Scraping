Unless you are familiar with the Northside of UC (Smart Museum, Young Building etc) you probably aren't going to find it.As with most Dollops, speed isn't high on the list of priorities. True, everything is handcrafted, in true barista fashion only one drink is made at a time and there is (unimaginative) latte art created. So with that being said, if you are getting coffee/espresso on your way to class or a meeting, make sure you make time for the process. The decor is super industrial which is cute, but Dollop still manages to have a messy lobby/cafe space. Not sure if it's due to students studying or being lazy with their belongings, but it manages to look disheveled.Also, the food for what you get is extremely over priced. There is a small reach in and panini press; it looks like everything is slapped together by hand, so maybe it's priced so high to dissuade people from ordering? I wish Dollop would partner with Goddess and the Baker grocer for RTE items and pastries. Especially in this type of environment I would think that Grab and Go options would be super popular and efficient.

Like any coffee shop, there's is some variance in quality based on who's making the drink, but this is the only dollop where I have felt like I was regularly overpaying for what I was getting. This location is regularly out of certain drinks and sometimes milk (almond, oat - although a lot of coffee shops struggle to keep oat milk in stock so this ones not their fault). I usually order a cappuccino and somehow the espresso often tastes burned and sometimes they don't froth the milk enough. My latest drink was almost at the same quality as McDonalds or Starbucks. The espresso was incredibly bitter/burnt tasting and the texture was too watery for a proper cappuccino.  I will say, for what is close to campus, this place is one of the best, but it is nowhere near the level of quality of most Dollops or other similar chain coffee shops in the city (La Colombe, Intelligentsia).",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

She filled the cup half with almond milk, filled the rest of the milk pitcher (containing the shot and the syrup) with almond milk, and then poured only half of the espresso/chocolate/milk mixture into my drink. So I received maybe a quarter-strength drink that I paid $6 for. I get that people are learning, but this poor girl was alone on shift and looked genuinely terrified by making this drink.

I love this place for a few reasons: It stays open until 10 pm, which is why I started coming here. Most places close at 8 and 9 pm in this area. Love the long picnic style tables, bright lighting, and open layout. The tables are great for group meetings and for people like me who just like to spread out with my books and laptop. The music here is great. Sometimes it's a bit loud but never too intrusive. I love how they play artist's whole albums. I've discovered a few new people I like just from listening to the baristas picks for music each night.  The baristas are friendly and remember regulars even though this place is full of students every day.
