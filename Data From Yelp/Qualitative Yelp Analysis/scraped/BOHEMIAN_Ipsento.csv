I decided to go with the Nutella latte, because who can resist that? My friend had the ipsento latte and we got two mini donuts that were the donut versions of our drinks. The Nutella latte was nothing short of amazing; it was sweet and tasted just like Nutella and gave me the perfect afternoon pick me up kick. I tried the ipsento latte and it too was delicious. It is made with cayenne and coconut and the combination creates a smooth and slightly spicy and slightly sweet taste. The mini donuts were also sooo good. I just wish they were bigger! The atmosphere of this place is clean and modern and they also serve beer and other alcoholic beverages. Many people were studying while we were there. The cashier who took care of us was friendly and helpful and not pretentious at all, which was great, since this seemed like it might be the place for pretentious people.

They are bringing the coffee to the people literally and allowing people to be a part of their success by crowdfunding their hopeful expansion. This location is very close to their other one, but offers a much more modern feel. The other a lot more cozy and I'd say more conducive when you're trying to get work done. Each cup of coffee here can be made in the style that you prefer. Really nice that it's nearby the 606, I only wish I discovered it when the weather was warmer.

I got one with beets and my friend got a twist on a mojito. I really liked the spices in mine and appreciated the subtle beet taste. The mojito was also great and so creative! We also tried the mini donuts. This is the only thing I didn't absolutely love. We got the Ipsento and the chocolate but they were both too spiced for me.

Enough tables to go around for you to grab you laptop and work while enjoying your coffee.Cute little donut treats for $1 each and couple of pastries as well. I tried their pumpkin patch latte (now available)- you can taste the pumpkin come through (no artificial flavors) and no need to add anything else. Sweet enough to perfectly balance the pumpkin and latte flavors come through. My boyfriend always orders the Western (ice coffee with some orange essence flavor) It's not a quick in and out like a Starbucks but you wait for good coffee- patience is key.

I came in here to buy beans, because I love trying all of the great Chicago-based coffee companies. I was having trouble choosing the beans I wanted, and the barista was very helpful in talking me through the different coffees to find something that I would like. I ended up choosing a gift box with the three Panama coffees, all of which were absolutely delicious. I love that Ipsento tries unique flavors with their coffee. While in the shop, I also purchased a cappuccino and one of the mini donuts! Everything tasted great and came out quickly. There were a lot of people in the shop at around 10am on a Thursday, so I can imagine this coffee is well-loved by the neighborhood.Overall, I am very impressed with the coffee and the service at Ipsento.

Often these drinks come out too sweet, but this stuck the right balance without being very bitter. Basil Mint Mocha - You can really taste the basil! Recommended as a nice warm drink. Hot Chocolate - Rich and creamy, yum!Vanilla Latte - One of the best lattes I have tasted. Donuts - These are so mini!

Their Pumpkin Patch Latte just tastes real. Like, real food, real ingredients. There's no question of artificial additives because you can taste how pure this  puppy is.

This is a very normal thing, and I see many of us doing it in cafes all the time. This specific location is open until 11 during the week, so it seemed like a perfect spot. Upon arrival, I read the various signage on the door. Notices about changing hours and the like, and nothing that affected me this evening, so I went inside. For a cafe, this places is extremely loud. Most of this is due to the height of the small room coupled with the classic Chicago copper top ceiling tiles, but it's definitely exacerbated by the way-too-loud music and the tipsy people yelling over it. This place is far more bar than cafe, though they did appear to be offering a full cafe menu. There were many seats & tables available, as it was a weeknight and after 9pm. I ordered a cardamom rose latte, which ended up being DELICIOUS. While waiting for my drink, I set up in a remote dark corner away from most everyone, and opened my laptop. Within minutes I was set upon by a staff member who informed me of a ""No laptops past 7PM"" policy. This seemed bizarre, and I've never experienced this anywhere in my many, many years of working remotely, especially not in a place which calls itself a cafe. I apologized, and let them know I wouldn't have caused this scene had I known, and perhaps a sign on the door would be a good idea, as it would have kept me from even coming inside. The staff member was pleasant and apologetic, and said he himself had suggested the sign, but it was shot down. Very odd, as there were (as I had mentioned before) other signs posted on the door. I suspect this is to lure people in and get some money from them before telling them they can't work in there and hope they stay for some more drinks anyway, whereas letting them know up front results in fewer sales. Clever racket, but comes eerily close to bait-and-switch. I was, at least, offered the option of a refund or a to-go cup. That seems like very cordial compensation, except the option of ""put the laptop away and enjoy your stay here"" was very obviously missing. I cannot determine why I was being treated this way. I looked as well-kempt as the rest of the patrons; I was not dressed in some offensive manner. . .they just decided I was not wanted there. I was at least given a coupon for a free drink, which is nice and all, but I'm not sure when I'd ever be back. The only reason I had gone there to begin with was that it claimed to be a late-night cafe; I have many other cafes closer to me that are perfectly fine, and this one has already made it clear I'm not wanted there. After all of this was squared away, I STILL didn't have my drink. I had to then hang around awkwardly after everyone knew I had been asked to leave. It was terribly embarrassing. It's great that we live in a place where we're allowed to choose the amenities we personally want our businesses to provide, but it becomes problematic when we lure people in with the assumption of amenities, take their money, and then let them know they were wrong. If you want to be a bar, that's great, but call yourself a bar. If you don't want people on their phones or laptops, that's your prerogative, but throw a small sign up, as Violet Hour does. Heck, turn the wifi off after 7, as Cafe Mustache does (they also have signage). Do SOMETHING. Don't just lure people in, take their money and then tell them if they want to be productive they'll have to leave.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Ipsento 606 was definitely a good spot to come to on this hot Saturday morning, and the mural on the outside wall is a sight to see also. I got a nitro cold brew on this hot day, but it was pretty tiny disappointingly. The coffee was good, but I think I like Starbuck's cold brew better....people will hate me for saying that..... Needless to say, the girl at the counter was super friendly and perky, and the overall coffee shop vibe and atmosphere was great. They have a variety of great menu options, and one that I got to try was the Western. It was a little too sweet though, but if you're into that, it is very refreshing.

It was also my first visit to Ipsento 606, having lived in the city over a year now. The coffee/cocktail I ordered wasn't a flavor I was very fond of (think essence of black licorice), but I tried a different option that one of my older sisters likes, and preferred that coffee/cocktail to the one I ordered. That being said, both drinks were made well; it was just a taste preference for me, no wrongdoing on Ipsento's part. Everyone in my group enjoyed the ambiance and fun conversations we shared at our table. Our apologies if we were the more animated group that night! Anyway, the main reason for the five stars is that my sister showed me the where they keep their adorable, mini donut collection. I was debating which flavors to take home to my girlfriend (Would she like these? Oh, come on. Who wouldn't?), and after we confirmed that we also wanted to order some drinks, the gentleman who was behind the donut display gave us a variety of donuts to try on the house! It was such an unexpected and generous gesture that has left me with a wonderful impression of Ipsento 606, the sprinkle on the donut, if you will.A big ""thank you"" for making my family and me have even more reasons to smile that night with the two free plates of delicious, wee donuts and chill, candle-lit atmosphere. Side note: my aunt is a flautist, so it was great and coincidental that a lot of the music playing while we were all there featured the flute.

I think they have coffee and a great staff and have gone in numerous times for coffee dates, to sit and get work done, and I enjoy myself whenever I'm there, thus the four stars. However, I went in last night at 9:45 hoping to get a small snack and maybe a tea. Despite the fact that their kitchen is open until 10, they had already shut down. My friend asked for a different dish, they had also put that away, too. I was hungry, I wanted to sit and chat with a snack and a friend, and finally check out Ipsento 606 at night time. I was just really, really disappointed. If your kitchen is open until 10, I should be able to get a bite until 10. What also bothered me is that the man who helped us, while nice, wasn't very apologetic and didn't have any other suggestions for us. I still love this place, I will still get coffee from here, but I probably won't come here at night.

I guess they don't want your books & laptop taking up counter space while patrons are trying to drink and mingle. However the other location does not have this rule.

Ipsento 606 was introduced to me at the local wicker park farmers market. They had a classy cart serving delicious nitro coffee. I've become a fan of the new nitro coffee trend and truly enjoy the foamy, smooth and light variation of classic coffees. Ipsento 606 hit it spot on with the coffee being very smooth and rich, where you could really tell the flavor of the coffee and how meticulously the bean was extracted. I decided to the go to the shop the next day to try out some more of the nitro coffee, I was not disappointed. After walking in, my eye caught the astounding baristas crafting away - almost like an art and their beautiful machines behind the counter. I would assume they have a special training method as I also got too witness a barista teaching (what looked like) a new employee the drip method. It was good to know that the baristas were immensely trained. Back to the coffee, you could taste the richness and natural bitterness of the dark roast. There wasn't too much foam on top and the nitrogen infusion was done correctly. Probably the best nitrogen coffee I've had to date.",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Not a table available, so we took our beverages and hung out in the park adjoining the 606.

Training of baristas is intense and important to their ability to deliver consistently amazing coffee.  Here at least once a day since it opened and for years at the prior location - haven't ever been disappointed. Super friendly and amazing environment - right on the 606. The original is also amazing but this is closer to home.

This is the best iced coffee to me. I have enjoyed cold brew coffee, but accepted that fresh coffee aroma I love from pourover drip must be sacrificed in cold brew. However, Ipsento's iced coffee was quite different. It was full of very fresh coffee aroma, but it also had a note of cold brew although I don't believe it is cold brew. I filled my tumbler with it on the way to the 606 trail, and refilled it and filled another tumbler on the way back home. I wish I could visit more often, but it is quite far from the north area. Still thank them for opening this new location as it is still more convenient (in terms of parking and nearby traffic) to visit than their original store.+ I tasted my wife's iced mocha with almond milk.

It's been pretty disappointing. I am a huge fan of their coffee. But each time I've gone, the line has been frustratingly long (only one check out open but several people wandering around) and then to have lost orders - doesn't seem efficient to me.I don't mind waiting for good coffee, but maybe figure out a better system for orders rather than pieces of paper that fly off counters, only to be lost.The people are always friendly, for sure. wish there weren't so many strollers inside - hard to navigate to the counter and pick up area.Will continue to go but will watch to be sure my order is on the move.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

The shop is modern and inviting, and I love sitting at the counter in the back window and watching the dogs play in the park. The first time I came I tried the Nitro iced coffee, which was really good. I didn't LOVE it purely because I don't love Nitro coffee, which I've learned now. But I still really enjoyed it. I recently came in early on a Sunday (which was great, so empty) and had a cappuccino. It was delicious and well balanced. A note with the cappuccinos though--they have a couple of sizes, so I had to ask the differences. The small and medium have 2 shots, I went with the medium because I wanted a bigger drink. But the medium is definitely a bit more like a latte due to the fact that it has more milk. It's still great, but if you want a more traditional cappuccino, go with the small. I also had a croissant, which was really good, not the best ever, but really tasty.

Now THAT is dedication. You can taste the effort put into their drinks from the ground up, literally. The ambiance is great, as well as its location. I know their old location had sandwiches, which were to die for! I don't think the new location serves them though. I love going here for just about anything, whether it be to escape my home routine, to work, to relax, or to catch up with friends.

I start my day with a cup of my favorite Costa Rican coffee plantation coffee (peaberry, expresso, french roast) which ships directly to my house. I am very critical of coffee shops. This place was highly recommenced to me. I admit, I went there without high expectations. The place definitely has a cool and smart vibe. Most walk in with either a large text book or a computer. I walked in with neither, just my low expectations. The room is large and cleanly decorated. The staff is friendly and working feverishly like bees. The basil mint coffee was recommended to me. What basil?? In my coffee!! Okay, calm down, keep an open mind. I waited a few minutes after ordering, then took my coffee to go check out the 606 route which I have heard soo much about. I'm checking out the very cool fairly new pathway as I took my first sip. Damn that's good!! The coffee used was pretty good, which I believe they roast in house. But what stood out to me was the milk used, besides the basil flavor. It tasted as if it came straight from the cow's utter. It was super creamy and rich. The basil and mint flavors made me feel as if I was eating a fine Italian meal with very good coffee.
