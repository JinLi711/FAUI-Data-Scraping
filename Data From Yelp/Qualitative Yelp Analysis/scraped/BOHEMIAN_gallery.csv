I typically only order plain coffee at coffee shops. This time was no different, so I can't speak to their specialty drinks. However, the dark roast drip coffee was superb.Some coffee shops are pretentious. The Gallery Cafe isn't one of them. It's a chill, cozy environment. Good energy. The staff was attentive. When I walked in, I was asked to wait for a moment. I didn't mind. I appreciated the communication. The staff member who waited on me was a quirky guy. I'm a little quirky, too. Great! The menu said that high fives were free with purchase. I wasn't going to pass up that opportunity. I paid, then asked the barista for my high five. He completely understood and proceeded to lift his hand about head height. I then proceeded through with a high five motion. I think it was a good high five. I can't speak for the barista's experience. The price was fair. I sat in the shop so I went ahead and paid for a coffee refill with my original purchase. The barista applauded my proactive method which made me feel like I could really tackle the day. Thanks for that.Overall, good experience. I was pleasantly surprised but not necessarily wowed. The tile floor and bathroom decor could use an update, but hey, the energy was on fleek. Thank you Gallery Cafe. You made my day a little better.

Try changing out the beans or something? The sandwich was just bland, not a lot of flavor and when you see avocado expect the worlds smallest smear if the stuff. I just wish it had something more to it, or even just more avocado.

I ordered a large Iced Tea and a tuna sandwich since I was dying due to lack of protein.  I don't eat fish but it was my last choice and so I went for it. I noticed that their tuna has no mayo in it which was a plus.  The guys at the counter took a while to notice I was ready to order. Lol. So heres what made coming here a great experince...they were playing all the songs from SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK!!!!! I was totally feelin it!!!! I was in love.  The Iced Tea was good. Very refreshing. The tuna was good. I had no complaints. It had carrots which added a nice texture to it.  Overall the food was good and the experience was ok.  The staff needs to pay a bit more attention to the customers though.,2 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

My friend (who i should note is very low maintenance) ordered an egg sandwich w Turkey or chicken Sausage. After one bite she noticed the turkey sausage tasted a bit ""off"". After I tasted it i agreed. She went back to the counter and nicely told the person working there. I thought immediately they would of just apologized and made her a new one. NOT THE CASE, they basically told her too bad. She then asked if they would just give her a bagel and cream cheese instead. They refused. When we walked out immediately following, a person walking by saw how annoyed we were and said ""oh you don't like the food their either?"". Ironically the person on the street had the same problem with a different breakfast sandwich a few months earlier. It's really too bad bc i wanted to like this place, but food poisoning is no fun and I can't imagine how they could treat their customers the way they treated my really sweet friend.

It seemed a bit minimalist...like a canvas painted black...a new begining. But alas they were open after all as a multi-colored neon announced.The menu board was clearly an excercise in pointalism... So much choice crammed into an elementary school sized portrait of a cafe! Breakfast, lunch and dinner provides many a chance for you to render several studies before completing a masterpiece of an opinion.Many subjects and shades of coffee are on exposition. They take pride in their craftsmanship and artistry. Delectible!Their foods are definitely muse inspired, not your McBreakfast here. These are mural sized and satisfying breakfasts! Lunch appears equally illuminating.If you are tired of being starbucked this is a great place to spend like a starving artist and eat like a patron. Few galleries can house this many great works.

My Chagall was actually really good, but I thought the breakfast sandwiches were slightly overpriced - especially in comparison to the lunch options that came with a side. I ordered at one area, had to pick-up my food at another and had to pick up my friends coffee beverages at yet another - totally across the room. Having to shove my way through the lines of customers to pick-up the drinks one-at-a-time, was not fun.

All unique and great)* Muffins (they have a number of delicious, wrapped up muffins)* Coffee (their house blend is very decent). * Smoothies (they have a number of flavors and combinations). Although I frequent this place, there are a few things that could be improved:* Their service is pretty slow. Usually there are only two people working the counter. So when they get 4 or 5 orders deep, you can be waiting up to 10 mins for your food. But if you have time, it's worth it. * Their staff is cordial but I don't think they've ever been ""friendly"". As other people have noted, they sometimes seem unhappy to be there. But I've never had anybody be mean or snobby to me. * The tables are a little close together, so it can be awkward trying to talk with a friend when somebody is quietly working on their computer right next to you.

Then when I asked for a cup she said she would have to make it. The tables are crowded. The wireless is not working. And every time a song stops she has to go over and pick a new one on her ipod. I don't really like listening to the clicking sound of her scrolling through songs repeatedly.Just... don't do it.",2 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I was shocked at how rude the two girls behind the counter were. They seemed aggravated that we wanted to dine in at 7:20pm on a Thursday evening. After realizing that she made the wrong wrap for me, one of them handed it to me anyway and said, ""Do you want to just eat it anyway? It's pretty much the same thing."" I had ordered pesto grilled chicken breast, and she made deli sliced turkey + coppicola. I said no.At 7:50 when I was halfway into my mediocre meal, she yelled ""Everybody, we're closing in 5 minutes!"" and began shutting off the lights.$12 for a wrap and milkshake here? Don't waste your money.
