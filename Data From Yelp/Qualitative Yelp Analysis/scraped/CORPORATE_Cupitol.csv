It's super packed with people and laptops on the weekends so it makes it difficult to find a table. There's even a sign on the bathroom door designating people to leave room for diners but of course not everyone follows that. The main menus is just filled with drinks. You'll have to find the food menus either online or on paper pamphlets by the cashier. Once you order, the cashier asks if you are dining in or to-go. But dining in wise, they'll ask you where you're sitting. Didn't know I was supposed to pick a seat before ordering and considering the laptop crowd, this creates a slight challenge. On to the food -very good! I had the tuna sandwich and they put the tomato, lettuce, and pickles on the side. My friend had the butternut squash, and roast beef. Both pretty decent portions and she enjoyed both. The food came out fairly quickly and they cleaned the tables off quickly too. I wish the water cups were larger.

It is community seating, so tables are on a first come first serve seat yourself basis. Given that, it's still nicer than a Panera to have a sit down meal with friends. We were able to find a high top table for 8 without a problem. They have plenty of seating options for various group sizes. They also have a nice area for people visiting on their own working on their laptops. You place your order at the counter. The menu has a nice variety of options. My friend and I split two sandwiches, the avocado egg wrap and the bacon, egg and cheese croissant plus an order of hash browns. Everything was delicious!! I liked the avocado egg wrap for a half a sandwich but I'd be bored with the flavor after that, I feel it needs just a touch more flavor to it or a light spice/seasoning. The hash browns were cooked perfectly and were the perfect portion size. The croissant sandwich was very flavorful and you can tell everything was freshly made. They did have some issues serving our party of 7 at the same time even though we ordered right after one another. They apologized and made up for it which I appreciated so I hope they continue to work on faster delivery of food so tables can eat at the same time. The manager/owner was visible and asking people about their experience and the staff was very friendly.

The concept of an ""all day lounge"" is great, and as a non-coffee drinker I always feel obligated to get a coffee when I'm using a coffee shop for their space. I don't feel that way here because there are so many options here from food to drinks (including alcohol and pastries). My only gripe is food takes FOREVER to come out. Unless I order a coffee or a pastry from the counter by the register, I can expect to wait for my order. I waited once for a bagel to go and it took them 10 minutes to hand me my bagel and individual packet of Philadelphia cream cheese on a weekday morning when the place was pretty empty...Didn't really put me off, but heads up - on weekends you can only sit in the back at a few reserved tables if you'll be working on your laptop.

I was there with a group that included 4 adults and 3 kids. We were given the high table at the entrance with no back- bar chairs which really wasn't the best chairs for the kids to sit properly. I'm not sure if they have high chairs for children as none were provided. They have a very simple, easy to follow menu (with calories listed as well). We went ahead and ordered upfront, and once the food was ready, they dropped them off at the table. Food was average at best. I got their Country Benedict which wasn't presented as I'm used to at other places. The poached eggs on buttermilk biscuits were placed in a bowl of pork sausage gravy. I'm used to having a crispy base for my poached eggs, but such was not the case here. It was very hard to separate the taste as everything was mixed together in a bowl or gravy. My wife ordered the Midwestern omelette that was made with ham, bacon, Wisconsin sharp cheddar, and a side of hash browns. I tried her omelette which was alright, but her hash browns were bland and void of any seasoning. The wait for own food wasn't long at all, but the quality was underwhelming from my end.

Regular black coffee or lattes were not my favorite here. Pecan minitart was addictive especially with black tea. Staff are pleasant. Would come back. - Visit #2:So hard to find healthy options in Streeterville neighborhood if you dine out. So me asked the lady behind the iPad and she recommended the avocado wrap. Avocado wrap has scrambled eggs, Hass guacamole, queso fresco, pico de gallo and wheat tortilla.. Portion is very well-studied, Japanese style. I really liked this wrap a lot. Coming back..- Visit #3:I tried almost everything on the menu!! I tried all the tea selections. My favorites are the cinnamon Saigon and white tea. Served with with a bottle like a French press pot, their teas are so good!. Tried the tuna sandwich and it was so good!. Coming back..Fast forward 2 weeks of similar encounters. This place is just amazing!! They opened around spring of 2017. They're open 7 am- 9 pm. It can be very crowded on weekends. Original branch is in Evanston. The owner lived in Europe for like two decades so you can feel there is some European touch to the place. What I recommend here is everything. My favorites are the avocado wrap, European granola berries breakfast, Saigon cinnamon tea and falafel burger!! Don't forget the freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice.

He promptly suggested Cupitol as his nearby preference. SO thankful he did!  Ambience is cool with instrumental music with a beat playing, a good mix of tables, comfy chairs and high tables. Though most people were solo this Sunday morning, I could see this location being adaptable to chill time alone with a book, meeting a friend or two, or work/study time. I grabbed a scone. The selection of flavors was to tempting to pass up. Some traditional like Maple pecan, some a little more unique like ginger lemon and they even offered a savory selection cheddar-Apple.A case to the right contains fancy European-looking treats. From the looks of other guests tables, I'll have to come back and try a sandwich or juice concoction!If visiting Chicago like me, walk the extra few blocks for your coffee at Cupitol and you won't be disappointed.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Technically an all day lounge, they have a surprisingly extensive menu (including alcohol). I dropped in Sunday morning to grab a coffee and get some work done. It was busy, but I was still able to get a seat just fine because the space is expansive. Everything is ordered up at the counter, and if you get food they'll take your table number and bring it to you. They also clear your table for you when you're finished. Which was great because they were really on top of their game and everything was super clean/organized.It was hot this morning so I went for an iced latte (16 oz) and an avocado wrap. Came out to ~$12. Both were perfect and I'd get them again. Other Yelpers have noted higher prices but I'd argue the quality was great and this is a main drag to Navy Pier - I can only imagine how much it costs to lease this location.

They have a pretty wide menu of coffees, teas, juices, assorted food and sandwiches, plus they serve wine and cocktails, which I'm never opposed to lol The main positive aspect is that it's a place in the area where you can hang out and chill, since there really aren't a whole lot of places like that in the area so close to the lake/Navy Pier. Several people were there just chilling.

They have good coffee - I especially like the Nutella latte - but the food is really where Cupitol shines. They have a lot of options for a coffee shop, and the portions are huge - you get a lot for your money. Some of my favorites are the Spanish omelet and the sweet potato curry bowl. All their breakfast sandwiches are delicious as well, and their hash browns are to die for. They have tons of seating, the lighting is fantastic, and the music is good without being too loud. The only negative is that there aren't enough outlets, so you have to get there early to grab a spot near an outlet if you need power.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Sounded great to me, as it was definitely going to be a chill atmosphere and we can could hang for as little or as long as we wanted, evening potentially having dinner there. I really enjoyed their menus. They really have it all from brunch to dinner and coffee/tea to smoothies to alcoholic beverages, not to mention their delectable selection of pastries. While they had various options, it wasn't too overwhelming and I appreciated their focused menus, as they had a distinct identity.Their space was lovely...very open with various seating options. We opted for the comfy sofa area in the middle. It was a Wednesday evening and it was comfortably busy. Many customers were working on their laptops while others, much like us, were chit chatting our night away.We ended up staying for dinner and sharing the chips & guacamole and a side of mac & cheese. I also got the tuna nicoise salad and one of their Greek beers. Portions were much bigger than I thought especially for a café and especially for the area, so this made me really happy. All the food was solid. Not knock my socks off amazing but quite satisfying, especially for a café where you usually get just a sandwich at most - not to discount sandwiches but Cupitol seemed to value all their options, not trust traditional café items. Food was overall good and fresh.My friend got their refreshing cucumber drink. She waited a long time for this (20 minutes) and when she went up about to inquire, the guy that took her order seemed to rush in the back, so it seemed like a honest mishap in which he forgot. It came out shortly after and my friend really enjoyed it. When placing our orders, service was good. Staff also regularly came by to clear our table.Will definitely keep Cupitol in mind, and would not mind at all coming back for dinner, but would come here any time of the day. I really enjoyed the all day lounge concept.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

My husband and I are so happy to have this new addition to Streeterbille. Secondly we adore the chill vive that this coffee shop has. The moment you go up the stairs and into the place, the music is on point and the beautiful Chic Modern Industrial decor is very nice. We love to sit by the large windows and enjoy the luxurious chairs and the seating arrangement. The only thing that is missing is a FIREPLACE (come on we are in the Midwest). The reason I am giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because they went so far to create a great atmosphere, but they fell short by not creating that warm toasty feel with a fireplace. With the huge windows, lots of cool air comes thru and we have to keep our coats on in order to enjoy that area. Im glad they decided to tie in the decor and keep the history of this building alive with a twist of modern Chic. This building was conste back in 1905 thru 1920 and it used to be an industrial warehouse. We have not tried their food yet, but we did try the chocolate almond croissant  And it was DELICIOUS, the plain bagel was a bit small but it was nice. The lattes were also very good and the art work was on point. We enjoyed the atmosphere so much that we stayed longer than we had planned. So we ordered another round of lattes and this time we each tried something different. I ordered the NUTELLA LATTE which was very tasty, I actually enjoyed it a lot. My husband had the MOCA LATTE and he was very happy with it. Overall it was a pleasant experience and we enjoyed the friendly service from the cashier, to the lady that picked up our plates she was super SWEET and very polite.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

We ordered the Matcha Latte, Mocha Latte, Benedict, and the Sweet Potato Bowl.The Matcha Latte was not overly grainy with excess powder. It was very creamy and had a nice balance between the sweetness from the soy milk to the slight bitterness of the Matcha powder. It was a great sip to start the morning!The Mocha Latte was rich, creamy, and perfectly chocolately! It was not overly sweet and satisfied our sweetness craving well for the morning. The foam on top was very rich and luxurious. Every sip was heavenly!The Benedict came with two very generous patties. The gravy was also very flavorful and delicious. It was one of he more hearty items on the menu. The Sweet Potato bowl was nice and hearty, but a little bland. Since there is a lot of brown rice, there was not much seasoning unless your every bite had a chunk of sweet potato. The Vegan Curry is a nice touch, but a little on the soupy side and needs to be more rich and creamy to add more flavor.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

So they took the food out the containers and brought it to us and our food was sooooo cold and the waffle was very hard. My husbands omelette was cold, toast cold and they brought me another waffle out but it was hard as a rock and I had to drain it in syrup to make it soft but that didn't help much at all!

If you get a cup of joe, you're allowed up to 1 free refill.Only down side is that this place doesn't have outlets for you to charge your laptops (probably to limit the dwelling times of patrons)..there is one outlet in the entire place so if you're really in need of electricity, you can sit there. By evening, they dim the lights so it gets a little more romantic.It is still new so the place isn't too crowded but I see a lot of potential in this place once the words start spreading.",21 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Unfortunately this is not the place. I came in on a Sunday afternoon, the place was not busy, over half of the tables were open so I opted for a two person table by an outlet (trying not to take up more room than I should). When I went to order, I was greeted with fake smiles and judging eyes, maybe I was under dressed in my Sunday casual ‍. When I was half way through with my meal some (maybe a manager?) came over to me and told me there were designated spots to be on a laptop before 3pm (it was 1:30), and that I chose a table with white writing instead of yellow writing - which denotes the spaces you're ""allowed"" to be on your laptops. That's it. No signs, pictures, or anything I could find at first glance that told me this. Silly me for thinking coffee and a quick bite while trying to lesson plan should be an easy venture. It was not. I can't imagine coming here again. This just in. As I'm writing this, the manager is coming around again to a large table to inform them of the same. This time he had a sign though. It's under the guise of being reserved explicitly for diners... I ordered a full meal. It is clear they care less about keeping paying customers and more about keeping an aesthetically pleasing restaurant. Also, don't order the falafel burger, it is far too salty to enjoy.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Waited 30 mins. for take out after being told it would take only 15 mins. Literally walked down the street back to our hotel and the food was ice cold.

I proceeded to order a Matcha Latte and Sweet Potato Bowl.

New Matcha served wasn't made well as I could taste the Matcha powder as I drank the beverage.Now to the meal, unfortunately I was not at all wow'd at the food. Food was average at best. Certain areas of my food were really hot and in my opinion appeared to be microwaved. Additionally my meal was saturated in the curry sauce with an appearance of baby food than a risotto.  Unfortunately I will take my business elsewhere.  Had high hopes entering and enjoyed the ambiance but that won't make up for the meal and service I received.  Kanela is right across the street if you're looking for a more edible and service friendly meal.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Conversely, Cupitol (worst name ever, sorry) definitely has a notably different feel.  In all fairness I had only stopped in on weekday mornings for a quick coffee and a bite. Now I've come full circle and made the weekend breakfast trip.  It's a very nice space with a great pastry case full of croissants of all stripes. They also have cheddar scones. Those were worth the trip.  Came in on a Sat and saw a big line and thought, ""My breakfast is DOOMED!"" But, no the line moved along just fine and I was there with coffee and scone in hand in 5. Thank god. They also have full sit down breakfast. I had the biscuits and sausage gravy with poached eggs. Tremendous. I recommend the trip.",Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Both brunch and dinner are phenomenal and it is rare to find a place where this is the case. I've tried a lot of things on the menu and have never had a bad meal but my favorite items would have to be the corned beef hash and the chopped salad.

Their food is a little pricey (not shocking for the area), but it tastes great and the portions are pretty good.

I manage a restaurant so when someone sent me the menu I was interested since they serve similar fare. Let me start by saying the food is delicious, fresh and moderately priced for the area.  It's quick service style so no waiter service which I dislike. If you pay with a card you choose then and there what to tip with handy suggestions built right in. I like tipping. In fact I am an over-tipper. However I want to know who I am tipping and what for. Having never been here I got the impression that you had to already be in the know in order to eat here. I found it cold and unwelcoming. We had looked at the menu before arriving but when we got there all we saw was the drink list on the board.  We were visibly confused, a fact the staff paid no attention to.  When we finally spotted menus they were only for lunch.  Though it was afternoon, we were hoping for breakfast.  Rather than asking if we had any questions (we did) the cashier rushed other patrons around us leaving us to discover the proper menus on our own. Ordering was simple, yet curt.  No real pleasantries or effort to make a connection beyond taking the order. The gentleman who brought our meal was more pleasant, but again a lot left to be desired.  We shared the country Benedict and the sticky bun french toast. Both were delicious. Worth coming back for, but I wouldn't go out of the way.  My cappuccino was delicious and served with some beautiful latte art, a nice touch. A highlight for me was the self service water taps that offered both still and sparkling.All in all great good, just lacking in kind, attentive service. I would definitely return for the coffee and pastries, especially if I had work to do.  It's a quiet, cozy spot for clicking away on the laptop with a nice snack, but for a full meal or if I was entertaining out of town guests I would go elsewhere.",voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I asked for a large coffee with a splash of soy milk. $2.25 for the coffee, and $0.90 for the soy milk. What gives? Is soy milk now as valuable as gold? People aren't charged for creamer for a cup of coffee, so why upcharge those that want to have a cup of coffee with a touch of cream, but can't do cream? And not is like I even had the opportunity to over pour soy milk or swindle ""extra"" soy milk. My coffee cup was poured full, and then a tiny glug of milk was added. I guess I would not be upset if I felt like I got a proper cup of coffee worth $3.50, but I did not. It's a small weak cup of coffee with a glug of soy gold. Review after first visit: I am going to have to give this place a second try. I stopped in during the week they opened to grab coffee and possibly a snack for my monster commute to the burbs. The house coffee was fine, but I had to pay extra for a splash of soy milk which was lame. People who drink cow milk don't have to pay extra for cream, why do those with dairy allergies? Anyways, the snack option was a no go, nothing available that was dairy free. Disappointing because I was super excited to have a neighborhood coffeehouse. Anyways, every time I walk by, I see happy people in there lounging about, and the website says there are vegan/vegetarian options.

After reading the reviews for the Evanston location, I was looking forward to trying it out and ended up visiting on three separate occasions.On each trip, there was the expected rough edges with new employees getting the hang of things, which is fine. The design is great, there's a good amount of seating for both tables and stuffed chairs.First trip: purchasing cup of coffeeI asked the barista to make whatever was his signature drink, the selection he thought he did best. He made an iced latte which seemed a little ordinary and as it turns out, it was very ordinary. If this was the best there was to offer, it was definitely not worth the effort and nothing to bring someone back. Second trip: purchasing whole bean coffeeOnce they began carrying whole bean coffee, we wanted to try some out. At first, the employee behind the counter didn't know what I was asking for when I asked if they sold whole bean coffee by the bag. There's the rough edges thing. Fine, not a problem. The manager pointed out the only selection they offered and I picked up a 12ox bag for around $17. That's higher end price point so I was expecting it to be great. It wasn't bad but absolutely nothing special and not worth the price.Third trip: food (hamburger)Nutshell version: it was okay. Presentation was great but overall it was absolutely nothing special. For the price point, I was hoping for something much better. After giving it three opportunities, it seems like one of those should have connected but each one fell short to one degree or another. Overall, tourists will probably love it but locals should look elsewhere. Dollop, a few blocks away, still makes a much better cup of coffee as does Goddess and the Baker inside Navy Pier but they don't really come close to matching the food menu.",7 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I stopped by on a Saturday morning and it was crowded but not unbearable. I ordered a latte and the smoked salmon bagel on gluten free bread. I really enjoyed the flavors in the sandwich and would love to know where they source their gluten free bread from as I thought it was great. I did think it was a little expensive when taking the upcharge for gluten free bread into account but it would be a nice place to stay and hang out for a bit. While I was there I had a lot of difficulty connecting to their wifi but I noticed that no one else seemed to be having any issue so it may have been a user error.,2 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Very comfy seating and the big windows give a lot of nice natural lighting. The service definitely has room for improvement tho. There were definitely some new employees behind the counter and the coffee making wasn't very streamlined. Had to wait for almost 10 min for my matcha latte.

A very hipster vibe and huge tables with tons of space. Coffee is really good but my only complaint is that when you have it for there the cup they serve you ends up making your coffee cold. I got a Nutella latte which I highly recommend and it was delicious but cold. Amazing breakfast wraps to start your morning off right.

Nothing was missing and I couldn't be more thankful that they found it before someone else did. I thought leaving my wallet downtown meant certain death (or at least hundreds of dollars worth of replacements), but I was wrong. Thank you!! Also, just an awesome spot with great drinks and ambiance. Don't know what you could possibly complain about. (Soy costing extra is about as ""new"" as being charged for guacamole in your burrito, come on.) Good vibes, good WiFi, super clean, plenty of outlets (ask staff if you don't see them), and thumbs up for great cappuccinos from this discerning coffee drinker. & I love that they have something for you regardless of what time you're there - from morning coffee, to lunch smoothies, to dinner, to booze. Didn't think it was touristy at all; lived in Chicago for many years and I think this is actually one of the only good spots in the loop area (which can often lack in character).",5 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

So this was what I thought this place would be like But it is NOT. So much better. And actually very different. The coffee was fantastic. Very strong but smooth and rich. I was told it is imported from Greece. They have a very high end Italian espresso machine obviously imported. See picture. Apparently it has to be calibrated daily to get very consistent results. I had a very tasty dish called the Sweet potato bowl. It had two poached eggs and kale and of course sweet potatoes with risotto and very fresh! See photo. On the side I had homemade bread with butter and homemade strawberry preservative. OH so European!!! Loved it! The water is really good either regular or bubbles from a very fancy reverse osmosis tap. The decor was very nice with plenty of room to spread out and do work on a laptop or read a great book. Music was nice and not over powering.  Fresh flowers on each table. Nice touch. They have so many pastries I was shocked at how fresh they can keep them. I found out that everything is made fresh daily.  Good assortment of blended juice and fruit drinks as well as other types of bottled beverages. Everything was clean clean clean.  Looking forward to my next visit to Cupitol!,5 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I usually order the cheeseburger and fries for lunch but I also have had a variety of other items on the menu which have been absolutely delicious. This time around however I ordered the cheeseburger and they messed it up!!!... this is not a $3 cheeseburger... unfortunately I ordered it 'TO GO'  and left the restaurant I was not able to go back, to  explain their mistake.  Also, Their bakery items have always been absolutely delicious too! However... this time around it seems as though the quality of their bakery items has changed.... waxy taste! I've recommended this place to several people as I am  in the Chicago area often due to work.I hope this is a rare occurrence... but not sure! I would have given it more stars however I'm giving it 3 stars due to the inconvenience that I left the restaurant with an order that was not correct and unfortunately I did not have the time to come all the way back to the restaurant back due to someone else's mistake.
