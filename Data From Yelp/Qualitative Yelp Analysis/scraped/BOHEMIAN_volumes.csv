Volumes is a one of a kind experience in this city, and I don't just mean because of the book/Cafe hybrid. It's because of their insistence on being a part of this community, and making sure that anyone who walks through the door feels like they belong there.The book selection isn't vast like a Barnes & Noble, but it is very intentional and specific. If the is a book you want, they will gladly order it for you. I will say, I love their poetry section, add the kids section is pretty dope too.The coffee drinks are mad inventive, always tasty, and often book themed. The Molly Weasley is a personal favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of the Bronte sisters. Oh! And they have boozy coffee drinks and alcoholic codes and beer if you want something stronger.They often have readings, performances, and workshops, and the team here makes it a point to find ways to give back to their community and Chicagoans in general.

There was a good selection of outlets too so this is 100% a spot you can come work at. As for the books themselves, there is an excellent selection. You can choose from children's books to bestsellers. They also have puzzles and little toys to choose from. I really like that they have some pencils already laid out for writing. They also have 3 book clubs that meet usually on the second Thursday of the month. You can just drop by whenever you want! The three are: Book of the Month, Sci-fi/Fantasy book of the Month and Feminist book of the Month. I would suggest reading these books even if you can't make the event.

There are so many cafes in Wicker Park I feel like Volumes is somewhat underrated. Volumes is 80% bookstore and 20% cafe. The cafe is just a little counter with a small selection of drinks but their matcha latte is the best matcha latte I have ever had. It's definitely more creamy and sweet but that's why I love it so much! The space is super cute as well. You can grab a book and sit there and read. There's even a children's nook just dedicated to younger consumers. They also have a lot of non-mainstream books supporting local authors or poets as well as unique greeting cards. I will always come here for their matcha latte!,voted for this review,Phill C. and 1 other,javascript:;,Useful,1,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Before I found Volumes, I was only limited to Starbucks for a Matcha that was not overwhelmingly bitter. I also love that they have readings and talks there, too.

From little kids to middle school to teens, it's one of the best collections I've seen in a seemingly non-kid part of town geared towards hipsters.Here's a rundown of the events they regularly host:- Trivia night every Monday- Storytime for kids every Wed/Sat Morning 10am- Open mic night every 1st Wednesday- All lady comedy showcase every last Wednesday night (I was there during this night)- Book club meet ups every monthCafe tables, bench seating, and comfy area for kiddos.

I was told they would order it and it would be in on Wed. I did not order or reserve it. I just went back (Wed) and there it was, as promised. I could have gone home and sat on my duff, pushed a button on my iPad and had it shipped to my apt, probably at a lower cost, but, that doesn't make for great communities or employ our local community residents with living wages.

It's owned by two sisters with backgrounds in education. And it fulfills two of my biggest passions, caffeine and books! Yesterday, I came here on a mission... to purchase a children's book for my neighbors, who are recent first-time parents. In the back of the store, there's a section devoted just to books for children. Volumes has a super selection. There are even a couple of pint size tables where the little ones can read and do activities. After looking through dozens of books, found one I hope my neighbors will love as much as I do.This is a pretty large space for a local bookstore. The majority is devoted to grown-ups. The shelves are stocked with many current sellers, plus lots of vintage books I hadn't thought about for years. An avid reader, I could do some serious damage in this store!In addition to books, there's a cafe with baristas, and lots of seating where you can sip caffeine (or wine and craft beer) and work on your laptop. Didn't look like there was much in the way of food except for pastries. And compared to a Starbucks, which can get really noisy, Volumes is almost serene. I'm looking forward to literary events as unique as they are.",5 people voted for this review,,,Useful,5,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Not only was the atmosphere beautiful, exceptionally clean, chic and comfortable, but the selection of books (and children's books especially!!) was top-notch. And that's not even mentioning the cafe. I didn't need any books while I was there, but they also had an AWESOME selection of literary-related odds and ends, from candles to bags to puzzles and more. I ended up buying my mother's birthday presents here, which she loved, and a gorgeous trendy notebook that I've been getting oodles of compliments on. But the CAFE, you guys!! I got one of the yummiest lattes I've ever drank there (named after a bronte sister, and i commend any coffee shop that has the first menu item named after a female author!!) plus my friends got a yummy juice, and delicious cookies, served by a sweet and funny (and fashionable) staff.

Most recently, I needed to buy a book being released by my favorite author, and they ordered it for me (no upfront cost to me) and it was delivered on the release date. I simply got an email it had arrived. Perfect!I've also been to trivia here. I like that they branch out and do fun events for the community. The first time I popped in was to buy a birthday present for my niece. I sifted through all the children's section had to offer; for a small place, there was a surprisingly large collection!Two comments that would definitely give Volumes that fifth star:-The seating is cafe-like, which functionally makes sense. If you want to drink wine for days and read a book, likely won't be the most comfortable venue. Would like to see some plush seating added. -When I went to shop for my niece, I had no clue what I was doing. The woman at checkout confirmed both books were stellar purchases for her age group. I think it could have added some charm if a salesperson had also made some recommendations while I was was shopping.

This place is wonderful. I am an avid reader (mostly fiction) and a snobby coffee-person who has worked in a few third wave coffeeshops. I have long dreamed of a place that combined these passions, where I could drink a latte and enjoy my latest literary find, and Volumes hits the mark squarely. First off - the place is not huge. But there are a few choice comfy seats scattered throughout the shop, and about a third of the space is dedicated to the cafe and table and chair type seating. There is a precious and comfy reading nook in the children's section as well. But if you are looking for a huge bookstore with anything you might want already on hand, you won't find that here. But I believe that is a positive point for Volumes. Instead of all the books you kind of heard of and all the books you don't really want, their wonderfully curated selection of books includes new bestsellers no one had told you about, well loved classics, and plenty of books that were somehow exactly what you were looking for. They can always order what you need, as well, so take that, Amazon! Additionally, the space is well organized and designed, a joy to move through. Their cafe is also lovely. They serve Metropolis coffee here, which is not my favorite in the world, but quite good nonetheless, and local. I think it will take a little more time for their baristas to master the perfectly poured espresso drink, but everything I've had has tasted delicious, and that's what's important. Their chai is spicy, their lattes are smooth, and their beer and wine and cider (!) selection is both larger than I expected (4-5 of each) and quite nice. I especially recommend trying one of the ciders. They are huge and potent and delicious. The staff here is still ironing out kinks, which is to be expected for a place that has been open just a month, but they seem to be well trained, and are very welcoming and friendly. The kind of staff that notice what you are reading and ask how you like it. The owners are also always around and very friendly and knowledgeable. Overall I am in love with this place, which is a nice little literary haven that is open and friendly in a bustling neighborhood known for Hipster condescension. I love wicker Park, but this place has racketed up my appreciation for the area several notches. 4/5 just because they do have a few kinks to smooth, and because I am waiting to see how their plans for many events and community evenings (readings, games, and trivia, etc) pan out. But I am sure they will be wonderful and I'll be back soon to tick that rating up one more!

I love the book selection- mostly best sellers- and they will special order for you if they don't have what you're looking for. Let's be real, it's not a Barnes and Noble that has a million different titles. Small but cute gift selection as well. There's a rewards program in which you give your name and email and for every $100 spent you get a $10 credit.In regards to the cafe, I don't drink coffee so I got a chair latte. It was warm, not hot (but tasty nonetheless) from a barista with a chip off her shoulder, but that's whatever, she made a good drink in a timely fashion.  Small baked goods selection but the brownie I had was delicioussss.

I'll keep going back and see if they have improved and update my rating. For now, I think 3 stars is right, especially when you compare what's just down the street from a coffee and book store perspective. I love the concept, I thought before they opened what kind of cool cozy environment it would be. But it's not. It's half a small book store, half a cramped coffee shop with packed seating. There is another half book store, half shop just down the street (Toms) that does a much better job of using their space. If you want to buy a book and get comfy and read, you're going to have to take it somewhere else. I grabbed a vanilla latte and it was served in a plain black mug. Again, maybe it's just an opening week thing but I hope they serve coffee in better mugs going forward! The latte was just ok, a little sweet for me.

I kept my cool together and kindly asked the lady who took my order, ""I ordered an Ice Chai..I was wondering when it's going to come out?"" And she responded , ""Oh....yeah haha...I...totally forgot about it....:)"". She didn't even apologize one bit and had smirk on her face which was very offensive. She made me feel less of a person. She was obviously rude and obnoxious that another employee had to apologize on behalf of her. The cafe is lovely but I don't think I'll come back here again.

When I looked at my credit card statement and saw I was charged there as well, I called the shop, as paying almost $40 for a kids book isn't ideal. 5 days pass, no call from the shop so I call again. Eventually I connect with Kimberly the manager I guess and she makes it sound like it's way too hard to go through their records and offers a store credit. I said I prefer a refund, she says she will have to get back to me. 3 more weeks pass and I have called every few days with no resolution from the establishment.

I think it's the best new place for kids. Their kiddie section has a super-comfy ""windowseat""  covered with pillows to which the kids are always drawn. Behind it is a tall wall with a window, that sort of separates this large section from the rest of the bookstore, so we like coming bc my squirly kids can be hidden from the ""adults."" There are two kids tables for coloring, reading, etc. This week they have a castle sitting out for the kids to color while they're there, which has been a hit with my kids.",Was this review …?,,,Useful,,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
