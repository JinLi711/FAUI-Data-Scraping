The food looked good, though I didn't have anything. And the staff was quite friendly. I don't live close, but if I did, it's the kind of place that I would frequent. However, if I did frequent Kusanya, it would be, without exception, with newspaper, magazine, or book in hand. Here's the negative:Normally in 2018, non-working wifi (unless it is a one-time, unforeseeable disruption, as can happen to any business) knocks a review down to one star. But these guys are a non-profit and doing good work, so there's no need to ding them. Not for nothing, but they also have no reviews less than three stars, which is definitely something. Still, after a twenty-mile or so, meandering bike ride through some nasty, nasty construction zones and streets (screw you, Hyde Park!!!) with Kusanya as the ultimate goal, I can't say it didn't leave a bad taste when, after changing out of my sweat-soaked jersey, ordering a drink, settling in, and opening my laptop, I was treated to internet that wouldn't connect.

I had the baked oatmeal with fresh berries and almond milk and it was perfect, along with a latte. Prices are so so extremely reasonable, and the bakery case has yummy items ranging from 90 cents to three bucks. I love the aesthetic here. They have beautiful art pieces and a rustic, hip feel to the general decor. The coffee is roasted and packaged on-site and also sold at the Englewood Whole Foods. Everything is top notch quality with choices of $1 mugs of coffee if you order it to stay. I love the nods to Englewood throughout the cafe, from the outline of the neighborhood sketched on tables, to the coffee sleeves and paper bags. Kusanya also hosts neighborhood events, a fresh foods night market on certain evenings, yoga on weekends, and open mic storytelling. Kusanya is also a non-profit that started on Kickstarter and that stays afloat through community support and grants. If you want to donate check them out online or stop by and ask about it. I look forward to trying their sandwiches!

Â Kusanya Cafe is an Englewood represent, located on the southeast corner of Green and 69th. St. Â I do have to admit the surroundings are a bit sketchy, even though I don't anticipate immediate danger during the daytime. Â The cozy joint is absolutely nice to get coffee and light lunch fare at reasonable prices. Â I saw many regulars take advantage of the free wifi and bright sunlight to get work done. Â I had the ""Ham Master Jay"" sandwich made-to-order by the friendly young lady at the register. Â It was executed impeccably and tasted delicious. Â Together the large, 20oz. latte and the sandwich cost less than $10 after tax. Â After visiting various coffee shops in the city, Kusanya is one of the most inexpensive places I know. Â If you happen to be the area or need to grab a quick bite nearby, Kusanya is an excellent choice. Â The nearest El station is the CTA 63rd./Halsted Green Line. Â For CTA buses, #8 (Halsted) and #67 (67th./69th./71st.) are in close proximity.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q6dkdzHS_2oKOB_RAyrnxQ/168s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kusanya-cafe-chicago?reviewid=UHtweke0KgAUVIcNQbvsNg&select=Q6dkdzHS_2oKOB_RAyrnxQ,voted for this review,Regena K. and 3 others,javascript:;,Useful,4,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Â Yay. Â  I shared the info with friends. Â Saturday morning I hopped on a southbound RedLine to 69th. Â While waiting for a westbound #67 bus I chatted with fellow commuters about how much faster the RedLine is running since the track improvements.I knew the cafe was in the next block when I jumped off at Halsted and 69th. Â Instinctively I checked out the north side of the street for 825 W. Â Typical northsider mistake because on the south side odd numbers are on the south side of the street. Â It's a lovely corner location with exposed brick walls and lots of big windows.There were a lot of people for 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon. Â A fellow patron approached me as I stepped up to place my order and ""paid me forward $2."" A very friendly ice breaker option. Â Of course I waited for the next person to pay them forward $2 as well. Â I chose a hearty bowl of corn chowder because I was starving so I will have to check out the lattes next time I visit. Â I told a friend that one of the sandwich options is a ""Tuna Turner."" Â He laughed and suggested that they should offer an ""Ike Tea"" to go with it.Nice place. Â Nice people. Â Happy to have a landing place when I'm visiting Englewood.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_8m83yHAwFouMIkOLMzvGA/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kusanya-cafe-chicago?reviewid=EtucMc2Vh9nQcBEQzcS-Vg&select=_8m83yHAwFouMIkOLMzvGA,14 people voted for this review,,,Useful,10,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

You can tell the owner really cares and isn't just trying to make money. Their donuts are awesome and the green tea (raspberry green) is delicious. Great music always playing and the baristas are friendly and welcoming. Warm place with quality food and drink and good service. The owner came up with a pay it forward option. You can add a buck or two to your bill and then the next person that comes in gets a free drink.

Â especially ones that are on the south side. Â So today I woke up and my throat felt all closed up where I was having trouble swallowing. Â I already work from home, so going to a coffee shop is no big deal in order to break of the monotony. Â Anyways, I could have gone to starbucks, but I already had this place bookmarked, and I had the time, so I packed up and headed over there. Â  This was around 7:30 am, so it wasn't too crowded. Â I stayed about 2 hours working, but I also I wanna talk about the food. Â Well, I don't really drink coffee often, so I have no idea what to order. Â But I did want some tea and I got a REALLY big cup of green tea with honey in it. Â And to tell the truth, my throat did start to open up when I left. Â I also ended up getting some grits. Â Now grits aren't usually the type of food you find in a coffee shop, but given the reviews of this place, I had to try them out, and my grits were really good. Â I had bacon and cheese in mine, and they really hit the spot. Â  Prices are very good here as well. Â My tea was only about $2 and my big bowl of cheesy bacon grits were like $3. Â They also had donuts for like $1 each and day old donuts which were 2 for $1. Â There were assorted muffins and sandwiches available as well. Â Also, this coffee shop is really nice looking. Â But not in a starbucks type of way. Â It's the type of vintage looking shop you'd expect to see up north or on the near west side. Â I read it's a non-profit owner as well.
