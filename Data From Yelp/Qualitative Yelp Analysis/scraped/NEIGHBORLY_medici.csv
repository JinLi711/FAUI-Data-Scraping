I have been to Medici many many times as it's a classic for students at the University - it's located just two blocks from the main campus.I ordered the Fresh Mozz sandwich and Cream of Mushroom and Spinach soup from their specials menu. The sandwich comes with a choice of thin-cut fries, potato chips, coleslaw, or potato salad, so I went with the coleslaw. They are very generous with their sides - you can tell from the photo how ginormous the portion of coleslaw is compared to the sandwich. I ended up having to take half the sandwich and some of coleslaw to-go - big portions means more leftovers!Anyway, it's a great place for some hearty food. I advise against the sandwiches made with baguettes since my experience with the baguettes have been that they are always too hard/crunchy. Popular at this establishment are their pizzas and milkshakes. I always come out feeling stuffed - so if you're looking for something light to eat perhaps the Med is not for you.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lDSaQ-hMuTyc94RGRJfmTQ/348s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/medici-on-57th-chicago?reviewid=wyyfiVaAOaQXxfcVunOrlQ&select=lDSaQ-hMuTyc94RGRJfmTQ,Was this review …?,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

Decided to come to the actual location and wasn't disappointed either! Definitely a good place to check out if you're in Hyde Park.They have a smaller take-out only cafe-type location that is just a few doors down from the restaurant. I love the super rustic feel of the place. They have these wooden booths and exposed brick walls which both gave a very loft-like cozy feel to the restaurant. Really gives the place a nice charm, which really matters to me! There are a lot of families here and students as well which gives the place a nice buzz. I dislike going into a super empty restaurant. For two, we ordered a calamari appetizer and two personal sized pizzas, which was just enough food. I absolutely love their margherita pizza. We also got the roasted veggie pizza which was pretty delicious as well. I've also tried the BBQ chicken pizza and the garbage pizza and those are yummy too! I'm not a big fan of goat cheese, but my friends have told me they like that one too. Basically, you can't really go wrong with the pizza here. The bathroom situation is confusing! It's one door that leads to another room with a sink and separate men and ladies rooms on the side.

For an off night, I am not sure why the wait was close to 30-40 minutes for a party of 2. What is most frustrating is that we were quoted 15-20 minute wait. Their patio and balcony seating were not open that night.Even after being seated, we waited for 20 minutes before our waiter even came by our table at all. When he did make his first appearance, he had the exaggerated brow-wiping-looking-super-tired-from-how-busy-it-is thing going, which frankly made it slightly more irritating since now we were almost an hour committed at this place and I was only able to sip on some water. I had heard that the thin crust pizzas were awesome, and not being a fan of the Chicago deep dish, I figured I would try the roasted veggies thin crust in personal pizza size. My sister got the Smoky Joe sandwich with fries. I will say that the portions are generous and I liked the shoe string fries on my sister's dish (but I guess who wouldn't). Otherwise, I was super disappointed that my pizza was not thin crust at all, in fact, it was super bready and felt fairly flavorless.

This spot used to be a couple blocks down the road and was relocated to a much bigger venue. My Dad came here with my Mom while he was studying in college and living in Chicago back in the 70's. I think he also took some of his students here when he was later a teacher. So it was a favorite spot. Still charming as he had told us about it. For brunch I would definitely go the pastries or sweeter route instead of ordering eggs. The eggs benedict my Dad ordered he said was just fine and well cooked. My smoked salmon omelette was pretty lack-luster. Not a lot of cream cheese inside and raw onions and tomatoes. The eggs were kind of stiff and just didn't hold any fluff or flavor. The salmon wasn't too fresh and appealing. Though, it did come with a potato hash on the side. Kind of like scalloped potatoes that were super crispy. Those were fantastic. Also, the hard bagel I took to go and provided much happiness way later in the night. My brother's chocolate chip pancakes looked like heaven. We did however order a cinnamon roll to split and that was bomb. SO GOOD. Still warm and gooey. It was everything. Before we left we went next door to the take-out section for pastries and sandwiches and we ordered a bunch of stuff for a party. The fruit tarts, mini apple and pecan pies were a huge hit and tasted great. Definitely stick to ordering all of their pastries. Additional tip, I believe they are byob. It's advertised on the door even though I noticed brunch cocktails on the menu. Maybe that's for lunch and dinner. They also have an outdoor upper terrace where my sister said she hung out once and had pizza and brought in her own wine to share with whoever the hell she was hanging out with (I'm going to assume some relative).

Like we had a choice.  Peace & Love meant you liked everybody.  Trippy.The Medici reminded me of the Sink in Boulder, CO, with all the carvings on tabletops & names/drawings on the walls.  We hippies were a creative bunch & we liked to leave our markings wherever we went.  Kinda like dogs, but we had more hair.At the Medici we drank coffee while having meaningful, heated conversations about political stuff.  Oops...maybe nothing has changed.I didn't much like coffee then, but I drank it to be cool & to appear older.  I do remember eating Medici food but not a lot.  Hippies were skinny, didn't eat much due to no bread (money). No wonder our threads (clothes) were baggy.In CO I recall we foraged for berries & edible green crap, and I remember eating macrobiotic birthday cake in Boulder that tasted like sawdust.Gifts for that cat's b-day consisted of fresh-picked field flowers or poems, because....no bread to buy anything.But back to Chicago:  Way back when, I thought of the Medici as mainly a coffee house, not really a restaurant. There were no chain coffee shops back then - this is what a coffee shop was, often connected to a bookstore. Hippies rapped (talked) a lot, read books & didn't eat.....wait....the current Starbucks scene comes to mind.....far out, manI groove on small, independent businesses that stick around for 60+ years.  Hangin' loose at the Medici.  Righteous.  Outta sight.  Can ya dig it?Gotta split now.Later",,,voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

For my garbage burger aka a burger, cheddar, caramelized onions, bacon, and bbq sauce on a brioche bun with a side the cost was $17. What?! At 5 Guys I can pay $8 for the double patty with the same amount of meat and toppings. The side options are cole slaw, potato salad, chips, or French fries. The cole slaw I got on the side was quite good, the cabbage was crisp and the dressing was not too mayonnaise-y and not too sweet, a surprisingly great cole slaw. The brioche bun is from the bakery portion of the restaurant, airy and light though not super buttery.My friend and I ordered inside at the cafe and then sat outside to wait for our food. It was our first time here and we got somewhat confused by the cafe vs restaurant portion of the establishment. From my understanding, the cafe serves at least partially the same food as the restaurant, but all to-go. Our burgers were ready about ten minutes after ordering and the actual packaging of the to-go orders is quite effective, I wouldn't be concerned about carrying something from here to a class or form a twenty minute walk away.

We sat downstairs in the wooden booths, which were super cozy! We took a while to decide what to order since I wanted to look over everything, so I'm really grateful for how patient the servers were!We ordered the 57th Street salad and the personal sized garbage pizza. The salad include prosciutto, dried cranberries, romaine, with jalapeno orange dressing. We substituted the feta for mozzarella and took out the red onions. It sounds so simple, but it was so refreshing and made for a really nice appetizer. The dried cranberries and prosciutto made an excellent combination. I can't eat anything too spicy so I was a little nervous about the jalapeno being in the dressing, however it delivers just a slight kick that still made it enjoyable.  The garbage pizza comes with a whole bunch of meat. Had to have the peppers and onions removed since I can't have them, but it didn't lack in flavor. The different types of meat also brought different textures, which was pleasant. We couldn't even finish the pizza, guess we had had too much bread prior. (They give you bread and butter before you even order!)I hate being the person that is so picky asking for things to be taken out or for substitutions, but it's dietary so I gotta! Our server was really patient, reading over our order to make sure they got everything. They even made jokes with us about it, which made me feel a little less bad about making so many different requests. I thought my friend had overhyped this place, but I was really impressed and appreciated my time here.

It's a small place with limited seating famous amongst the UC crowd out of a need for a café or just sentimental reasons. Lines are long during peak hours but you can find a place to sit otherwise. I have seen delicious looking pastries but the only thing I've tried here is their coffee and Mexican hot chocolate which was awesome. Menu looks good, willing to try their breakfast sometime.

They have high chairs.  They let us bring our stroller upstairs to put on the patio with us, and also offered to let us keep it downstairs. This is super helpful. They were friendly to the baby. There were other tables with young children, and they all seemed happy and well treated.  There is a kids menu, and the kids we've come with enjoyed the kids food.  The handicap bathroom is big, has a sink and a koala care changing table in it. So either parent could change the baby's diaper! My favorite items are their breakfast foods, sandwiches, salads, and any baked goods.  My frequent orders:Lemonade or strawberry or raspberry lemonade.  I love lemonade, and theirs is my favorite lemonade from anywhere.  It's frozen, so it's slushy like.  It's the perfect lemonade in every way.Veggie omelet.  This is a great omelet, and it's packed full of veggies.  The potatoes that come with it are great.  I always get cinnamon raisin toast, it's fantastic.  Sometimes I get a side of chicken sausages, they're great too.Moroccan Ragout.  This is kind of like a spicy lentil chili.  It's delicious, and very likely vegan.  It comes with pita bread and cucumber yogurt sauce.  It's not very big, but it's very tasty!House salad with balsamic pesto vinaigrette.  This is the best salad dressing in the world.  The house salad is fairly plain, but it's big and I love that dressing!  I frequently get this and the Moroccan Ragout.Grilled cajun pita.  This is a wrap on a pita.  The grilled chicken is great.  The cucumber yogurt is great.  What's not to like?  It comes with fries.Grilled chicken skewers.  The skewers and rice are very tasty.  There's not a lot of food, but it's all good.Cajun Turkey sandwich.  The Medici bakes their own bread, and they make amazing bread.  That's what makes all of their sandwiches so good.  This is my favorite of their sandwiches.Croissants.  They're all amazing.  My favorites are the chocolate and almond ones.  My coworkers love the ham & cheese.Apple pie.  It's amazing.Cinnamon raisin bread loafThings I don't like from Medici:Pizza, BBQ Chicken, fettuccine alfredo, fries (to be fair the fries aren't bad.  They're just plain, and not interesting.  They're kinda like Burger King Fries.  Whereas I like McDonald's fries).",,,voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.

I go back and am told ""only if you ask"". Okay, cool, I'm asking now, while I'm still in the store. Fries are 1.29 as a side with the sandwich, yet 2.99, over 3$ as an individual side. I was told they would ""have to"" charge me the full 3$, even though I just bought a sub and the appropriate measure is to just do a price adjustment. And the team members i spoke with seemed to not care that i was clearly dissatisfied with my experience, and were very dismissive, telling me to ""move"" so other customers could order since i ""wasn't willing to pay"" for the fries. Ridiculous, seeing as i would not have asked for the fries if i didn't want to pay for them.

This restaurant has a very homey feel and charm. Their booths can be a bit snug so I prefer to sit at the tables. Service here is excellent and the food comes out very quickly during brunch. The omelettes come with potatoes and choice of bread. It was one of the most filling brunches I've ever had and everything was delicious. The ingredients for the omelettes are not mixed with the eggs, but folded into the middle. They did not skimp at all and it was a super large omelette that I had difficulty finishing. The only downside to their brunch menu is that they lack a variety of menu options that pairs savory with sweet. You can get a single stack of pancakes but not sure it could apply to the specialty pancakes or french toast. For those who want a little sweet and a little savory, this menu is a bit limitation.

Their menu is diverse, with plenty of options, the service is fast and friendly, and the restaurant itself is lovely in appearance and ambiance (peep the occasionally turning statue high up there).I've eaten so many meals here, but I'll try to remember the very best items I've had. It's been years and I still think about the goat cheese dip in marinara sauce. We loved it so much - we were even dipping our fries in it by the end of the meal. The sandwich with cheese, arugula, and fig spread is also fantastic, though the bread is a bit tough. For breakfast, I love their eggs benedict, and definitely recommend that you ask for your potatoes crispy!

She insisted we had to eat here on our visit to Chicago. She told me that it had only changed in small ways. What I found was an excellent neighborhood pizzeria.The neighborhood is full of families and at 11:30 on a Sunday morning, we saw a lot of families getting brunch or lunch, plus some students rolling out for breakfast. Medici felt like a family place. The host complimented my watch and we talked watches as he walked us to our table. The waiter was attentive and friendly, happy to offer to wrap our leftovers and generally nice. This is very much a family restaurant.The decor is one of a kind. A giant wooden bishop greets you as you walk in. Gargoyles loom from the second floor balcony. The tables and walls are covered in writing from past patrons. Somehow, it doesn't feel grimy, it feels lived in. Deep wood tables and trim with brick walls don't feel so heavy with the high ceiling dining room. I don't often write about decor, but at Medici, it's part of the charm.We each had pan pizza. My wife got basil and sausage and I got the recommended garbage pie. I'm not an expert on Chicago style pizza, so I can't compare it with that genre, but from somebody who lived and worked in New York for 25 years, it's good pizza. The crust is thick like you want it to be, but it didn't feel like a bomb in my stomach like deep dish pizza can. A little bit less dense crust makes it more enjoyable. The meats make for a greasy pizza, but in a good way, like you would want with a hangover or in the middle of the night. The garbage pizza has ground beef, pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and green peppers. Somehow, it all balances together. This is not sophisticated pizza. It is not gourmet. It is hang out with your friends pizza and it hits that spot well. Better than a lot of New York places-- but not all New York places!My only small criticism is the bathroom. You go into a small room with toilets on several sides, both men and ladies. There is only one sink. This can make for a bit of waiting to wash your hands. The pizza is good comfort food.

Growing up in Hyde Park, The Med was a safe haven. My best friend and I would while away nightly hours drinking coffee and plotting our eventual world domination. Much like the neighborhood in which it is situated, the restaurant space is quite versatile. The booths are cozy and the coffee is good... presenting the perfect spot for catching up, There are larger tables for groups, as well as an upstairs area with adjoining outdoor roof patio. In the last few years, the Medici expanded, and now has an attached cafe and grade level patios for dining alfresco. The food is solid, and the prices are reasonable. The Med has the best burgers in Hyde Park. I took dates there in my youth and was always impressed if they could take down a whole Medici burger. The pizza's are good...no deep dish, but pan or thin crust usually does the trick. I also enjoy the grilled skewers and italian sub sandwich. They used to serve pretty decent loaded baked potato, but it is conspicuously absent from the current menu. The milkshakes are stellar and the fresh squeezed lemonade and orange juice are tasty... I think the OJ may only be for breakfast or weekend brunch, though.The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The wooden tables, booths and bare brick walls are laden with carved inscriptions of years gone by. So many etchings surround you in certain seated areas, that it's indistinguishable from a designed pattern. I'm certain that somewhere amongst these carved memorials is a reference or two to my own youthful indiscretions. This is not to say that the Medici doesn't have a more casual side. I have met there for business lunches (midday parking there can be a pain) and more... ""adult"" dates. At last count, they don't even charge a corking fee and are BYOB. The versatility of the spot is made apparent in it's space, and anchored by the terrific food. The service can be a bit gruff sometimes. Most institutions within college towns tend to become insular, and I believe the Medici suffers from this. Come to the Med for the burger or pizza. Meet there with a friend, a flame or fellow foodie. Enjoy the coffee and drinks, or bring something harder with you.

This place used to be awesome! The only reason I'm giving it an extra star is bc of nostalgia...But unfortunately, the quality has gone way down. While visiting my parents over the weekend, we swung by for a croissant and were shocked at how terrible it turned out to be! The croissant was so greasy - like soaked. I couldn't eat it as seeing the amount of grease made me sick. I understand that croissants should be buttery... but they should not be wet. When I went back to exchange (perhaps it was just this one croissant?) the manager was so rude! She said nothing to me. Nothing at all. She grabbed my bag of grease and walked away. One of the employees were nice enough to help me out and exchange my croissant for another. Unfortunately, it was just as greasy.Went back the next day to try a sandwich. We waited almost 30 minutes for a Mozzarella sandwich! And everyone was incredibly rude to us when we asked about it I care about Hyde Park and the community - which is why I feel so bummed that these places are getting lazy.

The bakery and the deserts are pretty awesome, check out their shakes or a vaguely reminiscent for starters, and I love the way their coffee tastes. They make a mean eggs Benedict most mornings.

My dear friend has CP and is in a motorized wheel chair. He's been there dozens of times both in his chair or using his crutches. Tonight, he went to the restaurant and was treated horribly. The restaurant was busy and instead of making space for him inside, they made him wait outside. After the 10 minutes that they predicted, he checked in to see how much longer the wait would be. He was then told that since he couldn't sit in a booth, they couldn't say how long it would be for him to get a table OR IF HE WOULD GET A TABLE AT ALL. Since when is it ok to say that to someone?!

Kinda crazy really that it's been a quarter of a century! So needless to say I have a sentimental attachment to this place. I probably ate the ~$5 (!) garbage pizza for Saturday night dinner at least half of all Saturday nights for four years.That said, I tried a Med burger again after a while, seeking its former magic. I was disappointed. Seeking something warm and juicy on this cold December day, instead I received a warmish burger topped with cold bleu cheese and cold grilled onions. The onions should have been hot, the burger just steaming of the grill, both melting the bleu cheese. Next time, I'll remind myself not to order the burger (which is what I promised myself the last two times I was here).Otherwise the fries were hot and the service great.",,,3 people voted for this review,Useful,Funny,Cool,Others will see how you vote!,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_deanonymize_ufc/f871a0ff7872/lib/img/200x120_ufc_globe.png,"Heads up: From now on, other Yelpers will be able to see how you voted.
