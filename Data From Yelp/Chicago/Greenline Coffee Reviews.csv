1,"This place is AWESOME!I was so hungry I gobbled down my food before I had a chance to take a photo.I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheddar sandwich and upgraded for 50 cents to putting it on a waffle versus a croissant or ciabatta. Definitely upgrade if you love the sweet/savory combination or have never had a liege waffle before.I decomposed the sandwich so I could truly appreciate the waffle and the waffle is definitely worth the hype! It's crisp, light, sweet, and perfectly toasted. The sandwich itself was quite good as well- nice and gooey with cheddar cheese and local chicken sausage. I like how much this coffeeshop supports other local businesses- they tout cakes and pastries from around the neighborhood. It's a very clean, friends, bright spot. One note though is the sandwich is not gigantic, it's more quality than quantity but I was starving and it filled me up and was highly satisfying in the process.I also got the iced tea which had quite a bit of flavor. The employee working there was also extremely friendly and helpful, when she saw I was hunkering down for a while to use the internet she recommended I buy the 'in house' iced tea which was slightly more money but allowed for free refills.I will definitely be back for the food and atmosphere! And the wi-fi works great.","

2,"I love this place and what it's trying to do for the community. This is not your place to go if what you're looking for is a fast cup of coffee to go. This is a leisurely, sit awhile, chat with the staff while you sip your drink and nibble your pastry kind of place. They've recently switched their hours and food offerings (which I don't think are reflected accurately here, they're now open 8am to 3pm), though they still have some hot breakfast sandwiches. I really enjoyed their lunch and dinner offerings, but I understand why it wasn't sustainable and they had to change to continue to serve the neighborhood well. They have board games available for kids to play, great wifi, even a printer. If you're looking for a neighborhood coffee shop to support, go to Greenline.","

3,"This winter season has been very mild in comparison to the last couple of years.  Cruising around the city, therefore, is much easier and more favorable.  Rosa J. visited another community coffee spot in the Woodlawn neighborhood in the south side of Chicago.  ""Greenline Coffee"" is the southeast corner of Eberhart and 61st.  By the way, this location isn't close to a Green Line stop, but is accessible via the CTA #59 (59th./61th.) bus.  I found Bronzeville/Washington Park/Woodlawn neighborhoods to be extremely beautiful, especially on a gorgeous day like today.  The existence of Greenline brings the community together and revitalizes the presence of local businesses.It's a well-run coffee spot for the local residents or for someone like me who always is in need of caffeine and a quick bite.  I saw the granola on the menu but was informed that they no longer offer this item.  That was alright by me since the ""soup of the day"" was equally enticing.  The chicken tortilla soup was hearty and tasty.  They also have the ""bottomless mug"" coffee option for a very reasonable price, so you will be able to chat with your friend and business partner the entire day without having to run out of coffee!  This place is nothing fancy, but for some reason, it's quite charming, with many canvas arts depicting the historic Chicago on the walls. I'm quite diggin' this coffee shop, and workers are fun and genuinely friendly.","

I have had their oatmeal for breakfast and the tuna salad sandwich with chips for lunch. I enjoyed each of them. If I were to have one complaint its minor. One time I was there the cashier was blasting the radio a little too loudly. Other than that the food is good, the space is good and the coffee, also good.","

7,"Pros: Very friendly ambiance especially if you need somewhere to study for long periods of time.Cons: Not a huge selection of coffee. Focus is greater on menu items and sandwichesBottom Line: Hidden and this slightly sketchy neighborhood is a gem of a coffee shop that has kind people that make a comfortable study environment.I'm only in Chicago for a few days visiting a friend at the university, so I decided to spend my first day scouring the area for interesting coffee shops to get some work done. Because this coffee shop is located on the south side of the university it's a little secluded from the more popular areas frequented by students. Nevertheless, there's huge signs albeit slightly dilapidated that help you find the place if you're coming from the southwest side of campus. I'll admit I wasn't very enthused by the location of the coffee shop given how rundown some parts of the area appeared. Don't be fooled though the community is very close in this area and the employees are extremely kind and warm. Immediately upon walking in, I was greeted with a smile and pleasant conversation. It doesn't seem like many students come here which in my opinion is a plus. Most of the other coffee shops on the northeast side are way too loud and crowded for my taste. I enjoyed a bottomless coffee for $2 which allows you to get unlimited refills while you stay at the coffee shop. Although the coffee is nothing special it is certainly inexpensive and you get a lot of it. They also have some French press options if you prefer something a little higher quality. They have a rotating soup menu that changes every day of the week. Since I went on Thursday, I got a broccoli cheddar soup that was very velvety and buttery. Even better was the bread that came with it which was large, robust, and not hard at all. If you find yourself in this area, I would definitely stop by Greenline coffee again for some pleasant quiet time and a very chill environment. While it doesn't appease my coffee tastes it certainly is everything I could want from a study space and a neighborhood hub.","

It is a corner coffeeshop which is modern, clean, comfortable, with a lot of light. It has tables and chairs seating, outdoor sidewalk patio, free wifi. Chicago nostalgia theme with blues music playing in the background. Very nice. It closes at 3pm although later hours will start soon.  So will the live music. My laptop and I were there on a Saturday in the early afternoon.  There were a few patrons and light traffic coming through. I found it on brewpass. The location is not convenient for me.

14,"This is a great coffee shop.  They have good drinks, good food, great staff, a clean and comfortable space, free wi-fi, and a small meeting room with dry erase wall.  What more could you want?I had a great hot chocolate, delicious sandwich, and delicious waffle. I would happily get all three again.  The sandwich is $6.25 and comes with salt & vinegar chips.  It is a good deal.  The waffle is great, and apparently the batter comes from Belgium.  The large hot chocolate is huge and comes with a good amount of whipped cream on top.The staff is so friendly and helpful.  They genuinely seem happy to be there, and happy to have their customers.  I like that the sandwiches come on real plates, and that they have real silverware to go with it.  There was a group selling spa products in the meeting space, and it really highlighted what a great space it was.  They were able to put notes about the company and prices on the dry erase wall.  They had plenty of space to set up, but they were separated enough from the main seating that it was not intrusive.  It's really nice to have a space like this!I will definitely be back!","

Great place to study, great place to get a quality coffee drink without paying ""Sixbucks"", long hours, free parking, sandwiches, smoothies and waffles to keep the brain cells working and free wifi. What more you could ask for? Oh wait. There's more!The sugar waffles are to die for. The batter is imported from Belgium and if you've ever tried to recreate true Belgium street waffles you know they are NOTHING like the spongy mess you get at American pancake houses. And they include nearly impossible to find in the US ingredients like pearl sugar. Why are you still reading this? Come enjoy this gem of a neighborhood owned cafe!","

16,"The atmosphere at Greenline Coffee is wonderful. On nice days it opens up to the street, and there's a lot of wood and brick, giving it a super comforting feel. More importantly, the fare is fantastic! I had a lemon bar and a fresh-brewed iced tea, both of which were delicious, and I stole a bite of their signature waffles from a friend. They were AMAZING. The waffles are super doughy and fresh-off-the-iron warm, and I've never had anything so melt-in-your-mouth before. Over all, highly recommend the place.A total plus: I had a chat with the owners, and they make a point of hiring local kids from the Woodlawn area, as well as supporting local entrepreneurship. Love it. A++","
