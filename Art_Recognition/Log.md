**Today's Progress**

1. Discussed with Ben and Michal about our objectives and plans.
..* We discussed possibilities of scraping artworks from Wikipedia or [MoMa](https://www.moma.org/collection/?fbclid=IwAR2YrXrfWNHidoUsCB86_s_C28h-_NnxOsggwxTO5WeJkHBrSbw_FR4cbak)
  * We decided that machine learning (more specifically semi-supervised deep learning with convolutional neural network) would be the best way to approach our goals.
  * However, we can also frame this problem as a unsupervised deep learning.
  * We wanted to answer questions like: 
    Do certain neighborhoods have preferences? 
    Do they favor certain types of art? 
    how are we going to categorize the art in a neighborhood?

**Thoughts** It is important to note that me and Ben have different objectives from Michal. Whereas Michal wants to create an app of some sort to be able to recognize artworks after taking a picture, me and Ben want to analyze how distributions of artwork types vary from location to another.
