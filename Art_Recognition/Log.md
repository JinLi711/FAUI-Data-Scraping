# Log Version 1

This is a log of all the progress made for the art recognition project.

## January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**

1. Discussed with Ben and Michal about our objectives and plans.
  * We discussed possibilities of scraping artworks from Wikipedia or [MoMa](https://www.moma.org/collection/?fbclid=IwAR2YrXrfWNHidoUsCB86_s_C28h-_NnxOsggwxTO5WeJkHBrSbw_FR4cbak)
  * We decided that machine learning (more specifically semi-supervised deep learning with convolutional neural network) would be the best way to approach our goals.
  * However, we can also frame this problem as a unsupervised deep learning.
  * We wanted to answer questions like: 
    Do certain neighborhoods have preferences?  
    Do they favor certain types of art?  
    How are we going to categorize the art in a neighborhood?  
    How can we classify pictures we might pull from instagram into categories that we can then use to look at neighborhoods preferences for particular types of visual art? 
  * We discussed how we can compare style of images by comparing the lower layers of cnns and finding a metric to measure mathematically defined style. Like what I did [here](https://github.com/JinLi711/Neural-Style-Transfer)  
  * Discussed how we can leverage resources like the supercomputer at Midway.  

2. Found existing datasets we could use.

**Thoughts** It is important to note that me and Ben have different objectives from Michal. Whereas Michal wants to create an app of some sort to be able to recognize artworks after taking a picture, me and Ben want to analyze how distributions of artwork types vary from location to another.

**Thoughts** There probably is not a need to scrape because there are datasets out there that we can use for free.

**Things To Do** 

1. Prepare for meeting with Ben at 4:45 p.m. Monday at the Regenstein Library.
2. Find resources that we can leverage.
