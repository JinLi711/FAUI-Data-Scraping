# Resources

Resources that we can leverage for our project. We will mainly use Python for machine learning.

## Data Sets
  * [The Met Open Data Set](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/the-met-public-domain-art-works?filter=solution-type:dataset&id=85a51186-8766-4379-a558-4d721e3a1190) Note that this dataset updates monthly.   
  Also, check out:  
   [Met Open Data Set GitHub](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess).  
   [Met in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/metmuseum/the-met)
   [GCP Article](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/when-art-meets-big-data-analyzing-200000-items-from-the-met-collection-in-bigquery) on the Met Dataset.  
   [Met API] (https://metmuseum.github.io/)

  * [Kaggle data sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?sortBy=relevance&group=public&search=art&page=1&pageSize=20&size=sizeAll&filetype=fileTypeAll&license=licenseAll&fbclid=IwAR1d8cGImamMP_GqtUAP3ndsDmYjrq_XP_R04opfgaYiQqR1eqwljDlNxcM) This is probably not the best place to look for art datasets, but it's here if needed.

  * [Coding Durer Data Sources](http://codingdurer.de/data.html)

  * [Data.World Art Datasets](https://data.world/datasets/art) Contains links to many other datasets.

  * [MoMa Collection](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection). 

  * [Behance Artistic Media Dataset](https://bam-dataset.org/) This site also contains image embedding.

  * [Tate Art Collection](https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/digital/collection-data) Also, check out:  
   [Microsoft Project](https://www.microsoft.com/inculture/arts/tate/), which uses this dataset.

  * [Cooper Hewitt API](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/api/)

## Websites For Data
  * [Wiki Art](https://www.wikiart.org/)

  * [Victoria and Albert Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/api)


## Libraries
  * [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) 
  * [Keras](https://keras.io/) This is a framework (not really a library) built on top of TensorFlow. 

## Processing Large Amounts of Data
  * [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) For distributive deep learning.
  * [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) This is probably going to be VERY IMPORTANT.
  * [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) 
  * [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
  * [Graph QL](https://graphql.org/) Introduction to [Graph GL](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginners-guide-to-graphql-86f849ce1bec)

## Guides
  * [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery?_ga=2.68514329.-987780976.1546634905)
  * [Deep Learning With OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/08/21/deep-learning-with-opencv/)
  * [Clustering Algorithms in Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)

## Helpful Scripts
  * [Met Image Downloader](https://github.com/trevorfiez/The-Metropolitan-Museum-of-Art-Image-Downloader) This script basically allows us to scrape images from the Met. But note that the code here isn't that great.

## Questions to ask Google
  * How do you integrate BigQuery with Python?
  * How do we do machine learning with cloud platforms?
