# Resources

Resources that we can leverage for our project. We will mainly use Python for machine learning.

## Data Sets
  * [The Met Open Data Set](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art/the-met-public-domain-art-works?pli=1&fbclid=IwAR2Sw2RA6GQMMqa1h2zO_8YyRriNh91QHkDI6LSIbxjmSCQ1szRw_TmR2Mw)  
  Also, check out:  
   [Met Open Data Set GitHub](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess).  
   [Met in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/metmuseum/the-met)
   [GCP Article](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/when-art-meets-big-data-analyzing-200000-items-from-the-met-collection-in-bigquery) on the Met Dataset.

  * [Kaggle data sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?sortBy=relevance&group=public&search=art&page=1&pageSize=20&size=sizeAll&filetype=fileTypeAll&license=licenseAll&fbclid=IwAR1d8cGImamMP_GqtUAP3ndsDmYjrq_XP_R04opfgaYiQqR1eqwljDlNxcM) This is probably not the best place to look for art datasets, but it's here if needed.

  * [Data.World Art Datasets](https://data.world/datasets/art) Contains links to many other datasets.

  * [MoMa Collection](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection). 

  * [Behance Artistic Media Dataset](https://bam-dataset.org/) This site also contains image embedding.

  * [Tate Art Collection](https://www.tate.org.uk/about-us/digital/collection-data) Also, check out this [Microsoft Project](https://www.microsoft.com/inculture/arts/tate/) Using this data set.

## Websites For Data
  * [Wiki Art](https://www.wikiart.org/)

## Libraries
  * [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) 
  * [Keras](https://keras.io/) This is a library built on top of TensorFlow. 

## Processing Large Amounts of Data
  * [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) For distributive deep learning.
  * [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) This is probably going to be VERY IMPORTANT.

## Guides
  * [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery?_ga=2.68514329.-987780976.1546634905)

## Helpful Scripts
  * [Met Image Downloader](https://github.com/trevorfiez/The-Metropolitan-Museum-of-Art-Image-Downloader) This script basically allows us to scrape images from the Met. But note that the code here isn't that great.
