# Chapter 1: Setting the Scene

## “Scene” as the Aesthetic View of Place (page 8)

  * Definition of Scenes:
   >  "There are people doing many things, sitting in a cafe, entering and exiting a grocery, milling about after a church service, cheering the home team. Then ask what style of life, spirit, meaning, mood, is expressed in all of this. Is it dangerous or exotic, familial or avant-garde? How could others share in that spirit, experience and embrace its meaning sympathetically, or reject it? What, in other words, is in the character of this particular place that links to broader and more universal themes?" (page 8)
   > "the aesthetic meaning of a place" (page 8)

  * Scenes can enhance the technology of locations. Check out Figure 1.4 on page 26.


# Chapter 2: Theory of Scenes

  * Objective:
   > "what caused something to be the way it is or what other things it makes happen. That is, we want an account of why this type of scene came into being here and now, and of what tends to happen if it is there." (page 29).

  * Culture:
   > "On one end, “culture” suggests a single, totalizing, delimited set of values that define a whole people or civilization" (page 30)
   > "On the other end of the spectrum is a tendency toward a strong particularism." (page 30)
   > "The question then becomes, How, when, where, and why do particular people gather around particular sets of cultural tastes and activities, to what extent do these tastes and activities both differentiate people by and build bridges across various social categories (like income, race, and religion), and how does the way they do so vary by place and time?" (page 30)

  * Three Analytical Components of Scenes (check out Table 2.1 on page 36):
   1. Theatricality
     > "Theatricality is about performance, and there is a certain logic of performance, not of specificity to generality but rather external to internal and convention to deviance. There is first the conspicuous display of self as an object to be viewed for the sake of being viewed: the exhibitionism of “look at me!”" (38)
       1. Glamour:
         > " Glamorous scenes place one in the presence of dazzling, shimmering, mysterious but seductive personae, perfectly fashioned, like me but more than me." (40)
       2. Neighborliness
         > "Warm, caring members of a community joined with friends and fellows in camaraderie—this is the ideal of neighborliness." (40)
       3. Transgression
         > "Transgression breaks conventional styles of appearance, shattering normal expectations for proper comportment, dress, and manners, outraging mainstream sensibilities" (41)
       4. Formality
         > "Formal scenes prize highly ritualized, often ceremonial standards of dress, speech, and appearance." (41)
       5. Exhibitionism
         > "Exhibitionism makes private aspects of the self highly visible publically" (41)
   2. Authenticity
     > "Authenticity says something about the sources of your being, where the “true you” comes from." (38)
       1. Locality
         > "Locality highlights being from here, being rooted in this place and this place only, untainted by alien customs." (42)
       2. Ethnicity
         > "ethnic customs suggest deep, unchosen, originary practices, somehow resistant to and undiluted by a homogenizing, deracinated, abstract global monoculture" (43)
       3. State
       4. Corporateness
       5. Rationality
   3. Legitimacy
     > " Legitimacy concerns the basis of moral judgments, the authority on which a verdict of right or wrong is grounded" (39)
       1. Tradition
         > "Tradition connects us to a past the weight of which informs our reasons for acting in the here and now" (45)
       2. Charisma
         > " Charisma creates legitimacy through the extraordinary qualities and accomplishments of great figures. Charisma connects us to magnetically compelling heroes, enjoining us to follow them, regardless of established rules and historic conventions." (46)
       3. Utilitarianism
         > " Utilitarian legitimacy hews not to tradition or prophets but to Profit." (47)
       4. Egalitarianism
         > "That legitimacy depends on respecting human equality stands at the core of egalitarianism. All people, close or far, high or low, deserve fair and equal treatment" (47)
       5. Self-Expression
         > "Self-expression bases legitimacy in the actualization of an individual personality. The good person is one who brings her own unique take, her own personal style, her own way of seeing, to each and every one of her actions." (47)

# Chapter 3: Quantitative Flânerie

  * BIZZIP
    Zip Code Business Patterns created by the census bureau (61)
    > "in addition to all sorts of for-profit businesses from fruit markets to graphic design firms, it also includes information about nonprofit and government organizations, like art museums, religious organizations, human rights organizations, civic and social organizations, and more." (61)
  * Yellow Pages
    > "They are collected and organized with consumers rather than bureaucrats in mind, so they often provide more specific information about qualitative experiential differences across organizations" (61)

  * Take a look at amenities table 3.1 (65) Kurtosis table 3.3 (70)

# Chapter 5: Home, Home on the Scene How Scenes Shape Residential Patterns

> "Different people are drawn to different scenes. The character of the scene plays a major role in determining who lives where and therefore what shape residential communities take. To be sure, more than amenities define the opportunities and attractions that places afford to current and potential residents." (132)

> "A first question asks which types of scenes attract which types of people. We find links between scenes and population changes across many subgroups: young people tend to increase in transgressive scenes, baby boomers are rising where self-expression and local authenticity mix, and retirees are increasing both near natural amenities and in places rich in the arts." (133)

> "how scenes distinguish within and transcend powerful social cleavages, like race, religion, and education" (133)

> "Contemporary research has thus turned to local amenities and their potential role in changing the trajectory of black neighborhoods. Schools, daycare, churches, and community centers often feature prominently. Ethnographic studies suggest that such amenities can play key roles in establishing a circuit of neighborhood relationships that encourage mutual support, information sharing, and respect." (140)
