# Notes and Records Files

Just a directory for recording notes.

## Log

Comphrensive log on the progress. Contains emails, my thoughts (ideas, research notes, write ups), and text messages. About 90 pages long, so yea.

## Work Hours

Work hours for each week.

## Notes on Scenes Scape Book

Professor Clark wrote an amazing book on the idea of scenes. I read through the book, and extracted quotes from it (since Clark wants me to provide evidence using data to support or refute his claims).

## Graphing Ideas

Sketches of graphing ideas that are worth considering to represent word distributions in different zip codes.

## Visual Write Up

My write up to explain my word embedding pipeline (intended for those without knowledge about cs and math).
